# KnowWhat Project Review Summary

Date: August 5, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive review of the KnowWhat project, including all issues found and fixes applied.

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Project Name Inconsistency
- **Issue**: Project was referenced as "KnowWhatKnowHow" in multiple files
- **Fixed in**: `config.py`, `Makefile`, `README.md`
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 2. Missing Configuration Imports
- **Issue**: `data_aggregation.py` was missing imports for variables it used
- **Fixed**: Added missing imports: `HUMAN_EDIT_DISTANCES_FILE`, `EDIT_DISTANCES_FILE`, `MODEL_FAMILY`, `MAZE_SIZES`, `get_results_path`
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 3. Bad Import Practices
- **Issue**: `data_aggregation.py` used `from config import *`
- **Fixed**: Replaced with specific imports
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 4. Incorrect Module Import Paths
- **Issue**: `calculate_edit_distances.py` and `calculate_human_edit_distances.py` had incorrect imports for edit_distance module
- **Fixed**: Updated to use proper import path `from scripts.edit_distance import ...`
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 5. Bloated Requirements
- **Issue**: `requirements.txt` contained 26 unused heavy dependencies (torch, transformers, opencv, etc.)
- **Fixed**: Removed all unused packages, keeping only what's actually used
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 6. Inaccurate Model Version Information
- **Issue**: README mentioned specific model versions that don't exist in the codebase
- **Fixed**: Removed non-existent version strings from README
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

## ⚠️ Non-Critical Issues

### 1. Unused Directory Definitions
- **Found**: Three directories defined in `config.py` but never created or used:
  - `docs/`
  - `data/human_data_analysis/`
  - `analysis/reports/`
- **Impact**: None - these are just unused definitions
- **Recommendation**: Could be removed from config.py to clean up

### 2. Missing Gemini Results
- **Found**: Gemini model is configured but no result directories exist
- **Impact**: None - appears Gemini experiments weren't run
- **Status**: Working as intended

### 3. 9x9 Maze Data Exists but Unused
- **Found**: `data/experiment_mazes/` contains 9x9 mazes but experiments only use 5x5 and 7x7
- **Impact**: None - extra data doesn't hurt
- **Status**: Working as intended

### 4. Minor Data Quality Issue
- **Found**: Some participants have >12 trials after deduplication (expected: exactly 12)
- **Impact**: Minimal - deduplication logic keeps best attempts
- **Examples**: Participants 19990318 (14), 20031016 (17)
- **Status**: Acceptable - doesn't affect analysis

## ✅ Verified Working

### 1. Project Structure
- All essential directories exist and are properly organized
- `.gitignore` properly excludes sensitive files and caches
- `.env.example` exists as documented

### 2. Data Integrity
- Human data: 311 trials from 25 participants (after 5 duplicates filtered)
- Machine data: ~1,800 trials per model as claimed
- Edit distance calculations work correctly

### 3. Analysis Pipeline
- `make analysis` command works as documented
- All analysis steps execute successfully:
  - Edit distance calculation ✅
  - Data aggregation ✅
  - Statistical analysis ✅
  - Figure generation ✅
  - Report generation ✅

### 4. Documentation Accuracy
- README accurately describes the project (after fixes)
- Trial counts match claims (~1,800 per model)
- Directory structure matches documentation
- Setup instructions are correct

## Summary

The KnowWhat project is well-structured and functional. All critical issues have been resolved, and the remaining minor issues don't affect functionality. The analysis pipeline works correctly and produces the expected outputs.

**Project Status: ✅ Production Ready** (as claimed in README)
