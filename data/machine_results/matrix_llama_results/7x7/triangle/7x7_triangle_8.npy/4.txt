You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G', my first move will be down and to the right, towards the empty space, aiming to get closer to 'G' while avoiding walls.

My next move will be to position (4, 5).

However, I understand that I can only move to an adjacent empty space. Therefore, my immediate next move will be down to (4, 3), which is an empty space adjacent to my current position.

So, my next move coordinates are (4, 3).

Please update the maze accordingly, and I'll plan my next move based on the updated maze.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I can conclude that:

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is an "L-shape" with a slightly curved or angled bottom part.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

(2) New maze:
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 P 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 G 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape with a curved bottom part, similar to the original maze. However, the maze is not an identical copy of the original, with different wall and empty space arrangements. The new maze still allows for a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces.
