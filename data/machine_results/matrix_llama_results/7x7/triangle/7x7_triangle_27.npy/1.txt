You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 G 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). My current position is at (5, 4), and my goal is at (5, 2).

To start, I'll analyze my surroundings:
- I have a wall (1) above me at (4, 4).
- I have a wall (1) below me at (6, 4).
- I have an empty space (0) to my left at (5, 3).
- I have a wall (1) to my right at (5, 5).
- I have a wall (1) to my top-left at (4, 3).
- I have an empty space (0) to my bottom-left at (6, 3).
- I have a wall (1) to my top-right at (4, 5).
- I have a wall (1) to my bottom-right at (6, 5).

Given these options, the best move would be to move to the empty space (0) to my left at (5, 3).

My next move coordinates are: (5, 3)

Please let me know the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 G 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved to (5, 3), my next step is to plan the subsequent move. I re-evaluate my surroundings:

- I have a wall (1) above me at (4, 3).
- I have a wall (1) below me at (6, 3).
- I have an empty space (0) to my left at (5, 2).
- I have an empty space (0) to my right at (5, 4).
- I have a wall (1) to my top-left at (4, 2).
- I have a wall (1) to my bottom-left at (6, 2).
- I have a wall (1) to my top-right at (4, 4).
- I have an empty space (0) to my bottom-right at (6, 4).

Given that my goal is at (5, 2) and there is an empty space (0) to my left at (5, 2), the best move would be to move to that space, which puts me directly on the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (5, 2)

Please let me know if this concludes the maze or provide the updated maze if necessary.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a zigzag or a slanted "S" shape, but more generally, as an "S" shape. However, a better description of the path would be that it is composed of connected segments in a somewhat diagonal orientation that gives a rough impression of a stair-like shape with a right angle, resembling an "L" shape when simplified. But given the turns and zigzag nature in its features, a more accurate description would still be closer to calling it a zigzag shape, so I will settle with calling it a zigzag for simplicity.

Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a similar zigzag shape:



1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 1
1 P 0 1 0 G 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
