You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 G 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G', my first move will be towards the goal, which is up and to the left from the current position.

Given the maze:
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 G 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1

The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (5,4) since we start counting from 0.

My next move will be to coordinates (4,3), which is diagonally up and to the left from 'P'. This move is chosen to get closer to 'G' while moving into an empty space ('0').

Next move: (4,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze appears to be an inverted "T" or a cross-like shape, given the arrangement of the empty spaces ('0') that facilitate movement from the starting point 'P' to the goal 'G'. However, considering a broader interpretation and the diagonal movements allowed, one might argue it resembles more a broad, somewhat irregular path with a focus on allowing diagonal movements. But simplifying the interpretation, an inverted "T" seems a reasonable approximation for the basic structure of the movement path from 'P' to 'G'.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a shape that could be considered an inverted "T" with adjustments to accommodate diagonal movements. This maze is not identical to the original and maintains a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces ('0'):

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 G 1 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a rough inverted "T" shape with additional paths to ensure there's a viable route from 'P' to 'G' that accommodates diagonal movements, adhering to the movement rules and the original size of the maze.
