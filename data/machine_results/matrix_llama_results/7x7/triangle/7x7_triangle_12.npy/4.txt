You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Since the goal position (G) is at (2,3), I will aim to move towards it. However, there are walls (1) blocking the direct path. 

My initial position (P) is at (4,5). The possible moves I can make are to the adjacent empty spaces (0). I can move up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

After analyzing the maze, I will choose to move to the left (since it's an empty space) to get closer to the goal position. The new coordinates of my next move would be (4,4).

Please let me know if this move is valid and provide the updated maze so I can make my next decision.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4,4), I have a few options for my next move. 

I notice that I can move up to get closer to the goal position (G). Since I can move diagonally, I will choose to move up and to the left, as the space (3,3) is currently occupied by a wall, but (3,4) and (3,3) are adjacent to a space (3,3 + 1, towards 2,3) that could potentially be traversed diagonally to reach (2,3). However moving diagonally up and to the left to (3,3) is not possible so the only available space for a move that goes upward is (3,4) The new coordinates of my next move would be (3,4).

Please let me know if this move is valid and provide the updated maze so I can make my next decision.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(zig-zag stairway)" or "alternating stairway".


Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar zig-zag stairway shape. The maze is not identical to the original, but it has the same size and includes a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces.
