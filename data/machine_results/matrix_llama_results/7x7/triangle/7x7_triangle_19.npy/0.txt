You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. I am currently at position (2,5), marked with 'P'. The goal 'G' is at (4,5). 

Considering the maze's state and the rules of movement, my next move would be to position (3,5), since moving directly towards the goal is blocked by a wall, and I need to navigate around it.

So, my next move's coordinates are (3,4) as this space is empty ('0') and it gets me closer to my goal by allowing me to bypass the wall in the next steps.

Note: The coordinates are 0-indexed, meaning the first row and first column are both considered 0, not 1.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 P 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3,4), I notice that the goal 'G' is still blocked by the wall below me, and the only viable path seems to be moving around the wall either from the left or the right. Since the right side seems to be blocked further down and moving left could potentially create more straightforward paths to the goal, my next move will be to position (3,3).

The coordinates of my next move are (3,3). This space is currently empty ('0') and appears to be the first step in navigating around the wall that blocks my direct path to the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze appears to be an 'L-shape'. This is because if you were to draw a line following the path of the empty spaces from the top right (where 'P' is initially located) to the bottom left, you would get a shape that resembles the letter 'L'.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces that form the same general L-shape. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original, and the position of 'P' and 'G' may vary, but the shape of the path remains recognizable as an L-shape.

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This maze has the same size, follows the L-shape path with its empty spaces, and provides a new and non-identical challenge to solve.
