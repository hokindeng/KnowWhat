You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 G 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. I am currently at position (1,3) marked with 'P'. The goal 'G' is at (1,5). My aim is to move towards the goal while avoiding walls.

Since I can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) to an adjacent empty space, I will choose a move that brings me closer to the goal and doesn't trap me.

Given the layout, a direct diagonal or rightward move seems most efficient, but since I can only move to an empty space and there's a '0' directly to the right of 'P', I will choose to move right. This will place me at coordinates (1,4).

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P G 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1,4), my goal 'G' is right next to me at (1,5). Given the layout, the most direct path is to move right again.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (1,5). This move should allow me to reach the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

1. A broken or incomplete "L" shape (turned 90 degrees clockwise).

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming the same general shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze meets all the criteria: it's the same size, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and the general shape of its corridors resembles an incomplete or broken "L" shape.
