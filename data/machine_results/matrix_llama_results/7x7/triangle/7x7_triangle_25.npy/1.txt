You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (3,6). I can see that there are empty spaces available to move to, and I need to move towards the goal position G. I will assess the adjacent empty spaces.

One of the available moves is to the left at position (3,5). This position is adjacent to my current position and is an empty space, which means I can move there.

My next move is to position (3,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I've moved one step to the left.

I'll analyze my current situation again. I am at position (3,5), and I need to move closer to the goal position G. I have a few options for my next move.

One viable option is to move down to position (4,5). However, that would put me in a position where I'd be blocked by walls and wouldn't be able to move further down. A better option would be to move down and to the left, but since I can move diagonally, I can do that in one step.

A more promising option is to move diagonally down and to the left to position (4,4). This would bring me closer to the goal position G.

My next move is to position (4,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a " Right-Angled Elbow" or an "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size as the original, where the empty spaces form an L-shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This maze is not an identical copy of the original, and it has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces that form an L-shape.
