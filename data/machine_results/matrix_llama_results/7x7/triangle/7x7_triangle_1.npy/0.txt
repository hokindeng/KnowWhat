You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 G 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'd be happy to help solve the maze.

After analyzing the maze, I've determined the best next move. Currently, the player is at position (3, 3), marked by 'P'.

My next move is to move diagonally up and left to the position (2, 2). However, this is not possible since there is a wall (1) at that position. Therefore, my next move is to move up to the position (2, 3). If there were a wall at this position, I would not be able to make this move.

Since I can make this move, my new position will be (2, 3).

Please update the maze accordingly, and I'll be happy to plan my next move.

Current Position (P): (2, 3)

Updated Maze:


1 G 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 P 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1


Please let me know if my new position is correct or not and provide the updated maze to plan my next move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "Inverted L" shape, as the empty spaces form an "L" shape rotated clockwise by 90 degrees.

(2) Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:
```
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 P 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
```
This maze is the same size as the original (7x7) and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces in this new maze form an "Inverted L" shape, similar to the original. This maze is not an identical copy of the original and still requires careful navigation to reach the goal G.
