You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I'm starting at the position marked 'P', which I'll assume is at coordinates (4, 3), my next move would be to the empty space directly above me, which is at coordinates (3, 3).

My next move is to (3, 3). Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (3, 3), marked by 'P'. My next move is to the empty space directly below me and slightly to the right, which is at coordinates (4, 4), but more to the right there is another empty space that gets me closer to (5, 3), (6, 3) which would take me closer to the goal. But first the (5, 3) then (5,4), then either way whether down to (6, 3) or the earlier option  (6, 4) , both those moves bring me closer but right now I am trying (5, 3) not available I try the diagonal which is one of both (4, 4), that's the first try and that took precedence and that I should try now.



My next move is to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (4, 4), marked by 'P'. My next move is to the empty space directly below me and slightly to the left, which is at coordinates (5, 3).

My next move is to (5, 3).

1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (5, 3), marked by 'P'. My next move is to the empty space directly below me, which is at coordinates (6, 3), and that will bring me right next to the goal 'G'.

My next move is to (6, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "inverted L" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "inverted L" shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 P 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 0

Please note that this new maze is not identical to the original one, but it maintains the same "inverted L" shape in its empty spaces, providing a valid path from P to G.
