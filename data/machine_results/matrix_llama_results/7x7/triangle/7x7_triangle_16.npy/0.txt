You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After analyzing the maze, I've decided on my first move.

I'm currently at position (4,3), which is marked with a 'P'. My goal is to move towards the goal position 'G' while avoiding walls.

My next move will be to the empty space directly below me, which is at position (5,3).

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (5,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After analyzing the updated maze, I've decided on my next move.

I'm currently at position (5,3), which is marked with a 'P'. My goal is to move towards the goal position 'G' while avoiding walls.

My next move will be to the empty space directly down and to the right, but there is a wall in that diagonal, and to the right there is also a wall. Therefore, my next move will be to the empty space directly below me but also to the left is not a good option since is a wall. So, I'll move down is also not an option since the goal is in that same column. So I will move right is not an option. I will move to the left, which is at position (5,2) is also a wall, so that is not an option. Then I'll move diagonally left and down but also is not an option. Then I will try to move to the right up diagonally, and there is an empty space at (4,4) .


So, the coordinates of my next move are: (4,4)

I'm currently at position (5,3), which is marked with a 'P'. My goal is to move towards the goal position 'G' while avoiding walls.

My next move will be to the empty space directly to the right and down diagonally is a wall, and also directly right is a wall. So my next move will be to the left, but I also went up there and it is not an option. Also left and up diagonally there is a wall, and down is the goal but it has a wall. My next move will be to the empty space directly right and up diagonally at position (4,4).

I'm currently at position (4,4) but actually (4,3) which is marked with a 'P'. My goal is to move towards the goal position 'G' while avoiding walls.

My next move will be to the empty space directly to the left at position (4,2) is not an option because is a wall. I also move down to (5,3), but this doesn't get me closer to the goal than I was 4 moves ago. I think the way to the goal would be going down to the position (5,3) and then try to go left.

After analyzing the updated maze, I've decided on my next move.

I'm currently at position (5,3), which is marked with a 'P'. My goal is to move towards the goal position 'G' while avoiding walls.

I realize that I've tried all possible moves from this position and I'm stuck in a loop. To break the loop, I need to re-examine the maze and find a new path.

However, I must admit that I've tried all possible moves from this position, and I'm not sure if there's a valid path to the goal. If you'd like, I can try to explore other parts of the maze or we can start over.


That being said, I'll try to make a move. My next move will be to the empty space directly up and to the left at position (4,3) and try to find a new path from there.


So, the coordinates of my next move are: (4,3)

1 1 1 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After analyzing the updated maze, I've decided on my next move.

I'm currently at position (4,3), which is marked with a 'P'. My goal is to move towards the goal position 'G' while avoiding walls.

My next move will be to the empty space directly right and up diagonally to the empty space at position (4,4).


However, I notice that I've already tried this move before and it led to a loop. So, instead of doing the same thing again, I'd like to request that we explore other parts of the maze or provide a hint to help me find the correct path.


If we're not allowed to do that, then my next move would be:


My next move will be to the empty space directly down at position (5,3), which I know will lead to a loop, but I don't see any other option from here.


So, the coordinates of my next move are: (5,3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After analyzing the updated maze, I've decided on my next move.

I'm currently at position (5,3), which is marked with a 'P'. My goal is to move towards the goal position 'G' while avoiding walls.

However, I've tried all possible moves from this position and I'm stuck in a loop. I don't see any other option but to admit that I'm stuck and cannot find a path to the goal.


If you'd like, you can provide a hint or reveal the solution to help me understand what I missed. Alternatively, we can start a new maze or try a different challenge.


I apologize for not being able to solve the maze, and I appreciate your patience and feedback.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "inverted L" shape.


(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "inverted L" shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 0 G 1


Please note that this new maze has the same "inverted L" shape formed by its empty spaces, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
