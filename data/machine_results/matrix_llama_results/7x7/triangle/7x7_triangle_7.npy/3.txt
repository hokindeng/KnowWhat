You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 0 0 0 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (6,2), and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (6,6).

Since we can move in any of the 8 adjacent directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonals), I will move to the right, as it is the most direct path towards the goal.

My next move will be to the coordinates (6,3).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Note: I'll use 0-based indexing for coordinates, as per the problem statement.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 P 0 0 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll analyze the situation again. 

Since my current position is at (6,3) and the goal 'G' is at (6,6), I will move right again to get closer to the goal.

My next move will be to the coordinates (6,4).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 P 0 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll move right again to get even closer to the goal. 

My next move will be to the coordinates (6,5).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 0 P G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Almost there!

I'll move right one more time to reach the goal 'G'.

My next move will be to the coordinates (6,6).

Please update the maze accordingly.

(Note: This should be the final move)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

For the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as an "L-shape".


Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 G

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape, connecting the start position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The maze has the same size as the original, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces.
