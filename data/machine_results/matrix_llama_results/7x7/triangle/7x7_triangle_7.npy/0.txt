You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 0 0 0 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position (6, 2), as it's an empty space (0) adjacent to the current position 'P' at (6, 3 does not seem to be a valid starting point given the standard 0 indexed array, I will correct the 'P' position to (6, 2) for this exercise). However, to respect the original format, I will correct my starting 'P' to an assumed position that is at (6, 2).


My first move from (6, 2) would be to (6, 3), which would place me at the first '0' to the right of 'P'.

Corrected move: (6, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 P 0 0 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll make my next move to the position (6, 4), as it's an empty space (0) adjacent to the current position 'P' at (6, 3).


My next move: (6, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 P 0 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll make my next move to the position (6, 5), as it's an empty space (0) adjacent to the current position 'P' at (6, 4).


My next move: (6, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 1 1 1

1 1 0 0 0 P G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll make my next move to the position (6, 6), as it's the goal position 'G' adjacent to the current position 'P' at (6, 5).


My next move: (6, 6)

This move should complete the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a diagonal path from the lower left corner to the lower right corner of the maze.


(2) Here is a new maze with the same shape of empty spaces (diagonal path), meeting all the required criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 0 1
1 P 1 0 0 0 G

This new maze has the same diagonal path shape of empty spaces, from the lower left to the lower right corner, but it's not an identical copy of the original maze.
