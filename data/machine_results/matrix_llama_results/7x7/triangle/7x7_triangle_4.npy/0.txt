You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. I am currently at position P, which is located at (4,2) in the maze. My goal is to reach position G, which is at (2,2).

Since I can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal) to an adjacent empty space, I will choose to move up to position (3,2), which is an empty space. This move gets me closer to the goal.

My next move will be to the coordinates (3,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I am now at position P, which is located at (3,2).

My next move will be up to the coordinates (2,2), which is the goal position G. Since G is adjacent to my current position, I can reach it directly.

Please note that I will try to move to the coordinates (2,2), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a "bent tunnel". The empty spaces form a continuous path that extends vertically and then bends to the right, creating an L-shape.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar L-shape or bent tunnel, providing a valid path from P to G. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but the general shape of the corridors is recognizable as an L-shape.
