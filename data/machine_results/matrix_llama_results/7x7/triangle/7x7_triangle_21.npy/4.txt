You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 P 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P). It seems the only empty space adjacent to P is diagonally down-left. So, my next move will be to the coordinates down-left of P.

The current coordinates of P appear to be (3,4), considering (0,0) as the top left corner of the maze. Moving diagonally down-left would bring me to coordinates (4,3).

My next move coordinates are: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After analyzing the updated maze, I see that I'm now at position (4,3). From here, I notice that I can move to an empty space that is one position up. This move brings me closer to the goal (G) and gives me more flexibility for the next moves.

My current coordinates are (4,3), and moving up will take me to coordinates (3,3).

My next move coordinates are: (3,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or an "L-path."

Here is a new maze that meets the specified criteria:

1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 P 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape, and there is a valid path from P to G. The maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it has the same size and follows the same encoding format.
