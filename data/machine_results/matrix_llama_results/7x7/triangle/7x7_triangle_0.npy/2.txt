You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves. To start, I need to locate the current position of 'P' and find an adjacent empty space to move towards the goal 'G'. In the given maze:

1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

The current position 'P' is at coordinates (2,4). A possible next move towards an empty space could be to the left, to coordinates (2,3). However, since that space is a wall, I will consider other options. The next best move towards an empty space would be diagonally down and left to coordinates (3,3), which is not directly adjacent to 'P'. But since 'P' can move diagonally to any empty space, and the main goal is to move closer to 'G', which is at (3,2), I will ignore diagonal movement for now and focus on a more direct path.

Considering the constraint of moving only through empty spaces and the goal of reaching 'G' at (3,2), a direct approach towards 'G' is blocked by a wall at (2,3). Thus, I will move 'P' to the right, to an empty space when available, or down if that provides a path towards 'G'. 

Given the layout, moving down from 'P' at (2,4) to (3,4) is a viable step as it moves towards 'G' and positions 'P' in a way to navigate around the walls more freely in the subsequent steps. Therefore, my next move will be down.

My next move is to (3,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 G 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze:

1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 G 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

My current position 'P' is at coordinates (3,4). The goal 'G' is at (3,2), which is two spaces to the left of my current position. Since the space directly left of 'P' at (3,3) is empty (0), the best next move to get closer to 'G' is to move left.

My next move is to (3,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 G P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze:

1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 G P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

My current position 'P' is at coordinates (3,3), and the goal 'G' is at (3,2), which is one space to the left of my current position. Since the space directly left of 'P' at (3,2) is the goal 'G', the best next move to reach the goal is to move left.

My next move is to (3,2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is an "L" shape or a variant of it, allowing movement in a mostly diagonal or two-segment path from the initial position 'P' to the goal 'G'.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form a similar "L" shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 P 0 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze meets the criteria of having the same size as the original, includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an "L" shape.
