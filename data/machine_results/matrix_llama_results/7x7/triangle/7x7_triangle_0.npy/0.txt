You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (2,4). The goal is at position G (3,2). To navigate to the goal, I need to move to an adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal. 

Considering the available options, I decide to move diagonally down-left to position (3,3). This move is valid since it's an empty space, and it brings me closer to the goal.

My next move will be to position (3,3). 

Please update the maze with my new position and provide the new maze for my next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 G P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I've moved closer to the goal. My current position is at (3,3), marked by P, and the goal G is at (3,2), adjacent to me.

My next move will be to position (3,2), effectively moving left to the goal.

So, my next move will be to position (3,2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A diagonal path or a zigzag corridor.

To generate a new maze with the same general shape, I'll create a new 7x7 maze with the same encoding format. Here it is:

1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 P 0 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar zigzag corridor or diagonal path, connecting the starting position P to the goal position G. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape and properties.
