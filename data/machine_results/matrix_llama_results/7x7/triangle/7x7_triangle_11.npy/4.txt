You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After analyzing the maze, I've decided on my first move.

I'm currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (4,1). My next move will be to the empty space below me, which is at coordinates (5,1).

So, my next move is: (5,1)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After analyzing the updated maze, I've decided on my next move.

I'm currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (5,1). My next move will be to the empty space to the right and below me, but since that is not an option because of the 1 (wall), my next best move is to the empty space below me and to the left is not an option because that would put me further from the goal, my best move will be directly right of me which is not possible, so the leftmost available option is at coordinates (5,0).

However I will choose an alternative that is closer to the goal, I will move diagonally to (6,2).

However since a diagonal move to (6,2) is a bad move, to maintain some optimality, I will instead choose a position at (6,0).

However moving down to (6,0) puts me in a corner with a wall around me, that means the only move left after this one is to move to position (5,0), which could be done directly with this turn instead of wasting a turn.


My best move will be: (5,0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "inverted L" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "inverted L" shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1

Note that this new maze meets the criteria specified, including having a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and having an "inverted L" shape formed by its corridors. However, it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
