You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position (4, 3). However, this is not a typical coordinate representation; for clarity, here's how I interpret the positions: the first row is row 0, and the first column is column 0, making the top-left corner (0,0). Given that the player position 'P' is at (4,1) (considering the first row as 0), I aim to move it to (4,3) which is the only adjacent empty space ('0') next to the player position 'P' that doesn't involve moving into a wall ('1') or staying in the same place.

To clarify, given the formatting of the maze and the positions of elements within it:
- The position immediately above 'P' is a wall.
- The position to the right of 'P' is a wall.
- The position below 'P' is an empty space ('0'), but moving there doesn't directly help in reaching 'G'.
- The position to the left of 'P' is also an empty space ('0'), but it does not bring us closer to 'G'.

Therefore, moving 'P' to the right to (4,3) (considering diagonal is not beneficial in this scenario directly towards the goal without hitting a wall) would be incorrect based on direct diagonal movement misunderstanding. The correct initial analysis aimed for a direct approach but misjudged the movement to an accessible '0' space towards the goal. The intended movement should be down to (5,1) since it's the viable move towards potential paths to 'G'. 

Corrected Response: My next move's coordinates are (5,1), moving down from the current position of 'P'.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze and my current position at (5,1), I will analyze the possible moves:

- Moving up is not beneficial since it returns me to the previous position.
- Moving right is not possible due to a wall.
- Moving down is not possible due to a wall.
- Moving left is possible, but it doesn't directly help in reaching the goal 'G'.
- However, moving diagonally down and left isn't an option due to a wall, and diagonally down and right isn't possible directly due to the structure of the maze and wall positions.
- Moving diagonally up and right isn't possible due to a wall, but moving diagonally up and left is not beneficial as it moves away from the goal.

Given these constraints and focusing on a path that might eventually lead to 'G', the most viable immediate move that keeps the path to 'G' open is moving left. 

My next move's coordinates are (5,0), moving left from the current position of 'P'.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag path" or more precisely, a "staircase-like" shape that connects the player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming the same staircase-like shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 0 1
1 P 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 G 1
1 0 0 1 0 0 1

This new maze meets the criteria:
- It has the same size as the original maze (7x7).
- It includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces.
- It is not an identical copy of the original maze.
- The general shape formed by its empty spaces is a staircase-like shape, similar to the original maze.

Note that there might be variations in how one interprets the "general shape" of paths in a maze, but the staircase or zig-zag pattern captures the essence of navigating through diagonal moves and changes in direction to reach the goal from the player's position in the original and new maze.
