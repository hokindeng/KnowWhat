You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (1, 4), marked by 'P'. My goal is to reach the position (5, 0), marked by 'G'. 

Looking at the maze, I can move up, down, left, right, or any diagonal from the current position. Since the goal is to move towards the goal position, I will try to move down-left. However, there is a wall at (2, 4), so moving directly down is not possible.

A possible move is to go left to (1, 3), which is an empty space. This move will bring me closer to the goal and give me more options for the next move.

The coordinates of my next move are (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

Since I've moved to (1, 3), my next goal is to continue moving towards the goal position (5, 0). 

Looking at the maze, I can see that moving down is still blocked by a wall, but I can try to move down-left diagonally to (2, 2). However, there is a wall at (2, 2), so that's not a viable option.

Another possibility is to move left to (1, 2), which is an empty space. This move will give me more options for my next move and bring me closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll plan my next move.

From my current position (1, 2), I notice that I can move down-left diagonally to (2, 1), but that's blocked by a wall. I can also try to move left to (1, 1), which is an empty space.

However, I also see an opportunity to move down to (2, 2), but there is a wall. Moving right would bring me away from the goal.

Considering my options, moving left to (1, 1) seems like a good choice, as it will give me more flexibility for my next move and bring me closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (1, 1), I can try to move down-left, but there's a wall at (2, 0). I can also try to move left, but there's a wall at (0, 1).

However, I notice that I can move left is not possible, but moving down is also not possible due to a wall. Moving right would bring me away from the goal.

One option is to move down-right diagonally to (2, 2), but there is a wall. A good option is to move up to (0, 1), which is an empty space.

The coordinates of my next move are (0, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L" shape.

The "L" shape is formed by the empty spaces, starting from the top-left corner, moving down and then turning right, and finally reaching the goal at the bottom-left corner.

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "L" shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
G 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it has the same size and features a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, forming an "L" shape.
