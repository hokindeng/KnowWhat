You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To solve the maze, I will consider all eight possible moves (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) from the current position 'P' located at (4,4).

My next move would be to the adjacent empty space. I'll move left to the position (4,3), as it is the closest empty space.

Please update the maze accordingly.

Next move coordinates: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move.

My current position 'P' is at (4,3). I can see that the goal 'G' is located at (1,1). I need to move closer to the goal while avoiding walls. My next move will be to the adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal. 

I'll move up to the position (3,3), as it is the closest empty space in the general direction towards the goal.

Please update the maze accordingly.

Next move coordinates: (3,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move.

My current position 'P' is at (3,3). I see that the goal 'G' is still located at (1,1). To get closer to the goal, I need to move around the wall above and to the left of me.

I'll move left to the position (3,2), as it is the closest empty space that brings me closer to the goal.

Please update the maze accordingly.

Next move coordinates: (3,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) The general shape is a "zig-zag" or a "meandering" path, roughly resembling a wavy line that connects the starting point 'P' to the goal 'G'.

To create a new maze with the same general shape, I will generate a new maze with empty spaces that form a similar zig-zag or meandering path.

Here is the new maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a zig-zag or meandering path that connects the starting point 'P' to the goal 'G'. Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it retains the same general shape characteristics.
