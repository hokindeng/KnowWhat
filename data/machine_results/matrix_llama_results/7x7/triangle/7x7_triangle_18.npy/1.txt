You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To start solving the maze, I'll identify the current position of the player 'P' and the goal 'G', and then determine the most direct path considering the maze's layout.

The player 'P' is at position (5, 4) and the goal 'G' is at position (1, 1). Given the constraints of the maze and the movement rules (up, down, left, right, and any diagonal), the optimal first move would be to get closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

A viable first move would be to move diagonally up-left to position (4, 3), which is an empty space '0'. 

Therefore, my next move would be to (4, 3).

(Note: Coordinates are based on a 0-indexed system, with (0,0) being the top-left corner of the maze.)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze appears to be an inverted "L" or a "Gamma" shape (Î“), considering the configuration of the corridors.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form a similar Gamma shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a Gamma shape, but the maze layout is different from the original. The path from 'P' to 'G' is valid and can be navigated through the empty spaces.
