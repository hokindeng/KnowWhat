You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To solve the maze, I will apply a greedy algorithm strategy, aiming to reduce the distance between the current player position 'P' and the goal position 'G' while avoiding walls and moving through empty spaces.

My current position is the 'P' located at (4,4). The goal position 'G' is at (1,1).

Aiming to reduce the distance, my next move should ideally be moving up because 'G' is above 'P'. However, a direct path up is blocked by a wall at (3,4). Therefore, I need to find an alternative path that allows me to bypass this wall while still making progress towards the goal.

Observing the maze, if I move left from (4,4), I can avoid the wall directly above me and potentially create a path to move up later.

So, my next move is to move left, which will place me at the coordinates (4,3).

New position: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, my current position 'P' is now at (4,3).

Again, the goal position 'G' is at (1,1), meaning I need to move upwards. Since my last move allowed me to avoid the wall directly above my initial position, I'm now in a position where I can move up without hitting a wall.

Thus, my next move is to move up, aiming to reduce the vertical distance between 'P' and 'G'. By moving up, I will place myself at the coordinates (3,3).

However, there's a wall at (3,3). Since I can move diagonally, I can attempt to bypass this wall by moving diagonally up and left if possible, or simply left and then up if diagonal movement to the preferred location is not feasible.

Given the current state, moving directly up to (3,3) is not an option due to the wall. The best immediate move would be to move left again, to (4,2), aiming to create a future opportunity to move up without hitting a wall.

New position: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my current position 'P' at (4,2) and the goal 'G' at (1,1), I still aim to move upwards to reduce the vertical distance.

Observing the maze, I see an opportunity to move up diagonally to the left. Since I can move diagonally, I will place myself at the coordinates (3,1) if possible, bypassing the wall that would block a direct upward move.

However, upon re-examining the rules, I realized that I should provide a move that aligns with the available spaces. The direct diagonal move I initially considered might not align with the immediate available options.

Given the current state, I can see that moving directly up from (4,2) to (3,2) is feasible, as there's a '0' (empty space) at (3,2), indicating I can move into that space.

New position: (3,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze appears to be a meandering path or a winding corridor, somewhat resembling an "L" shape but with additional turns and a continuation beyond the corner.

For simplicity, I'll refer to this shape as a "Winding L" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size as the original, where the empty spaces form a similar "Winding L" shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 0 1
1 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the "Winding L" shape is maintained, providing a path from 'P' to 'G' that can be reached through empty spaces, while avoiding walls. The maze is not an identical copy of the original but has the same size and maintains a similar "Winding L" shape formed by its empty spaces.
