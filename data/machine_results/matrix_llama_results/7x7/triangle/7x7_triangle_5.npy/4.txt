You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
0 G 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P). I can move to the adjacent empty spaces (0s) to progress towards the goal (G).

From the current position, P, at (3, 3), I have two possible moves:
- Up: (2, 3) is blocked by a wall.
- Down: (4, 3) is blocked by a wall.
- Left: (3, 2) is blocked by a wall.
- Right: (3, 4) is blocked by a wall.
- Up-left: (2, 2) is blocked by a wall.
- Up-right: (2, 4) is blocked by a wall.
- Down-left: (4, 2) is an empty space.
- Down-right: (4, 4) is blocked by a wall.

Since the only possible move is down-left, my next move will be to (4, 2).

Please let me know the updated maze. 

My move is (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
0 G 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P).

From the current position, P, at (4, 2), I have possible moves:
- Up: (3, 2) is blocked by a wall.
- Down: (5, 2) is an empty space.
- Left: (4, 1) is blocked by a wall.
- Right: (4, 3) is blocked by a wall.
- Up-left: (3, 1) is blocked by a wall.
- Up-right: (3, 3) is an empty space.
- Down-left: (5, 1) is blocked by a wall.
- Down-right: (5, 3) is blocked by a wall.

Since the possible moves are down to (5, 2) and up-right to (3, 3), I will prioritize the move that brings me closer to the goal or provides more opportunities for the next move. In this case, I will move down to (5, 2).

My move is (5, 2).

However, upon re-examining the maze, I realized that moving up-right to (3, 3) and then to (3, 4) or (2, 3), might not be a good idea because it would put me in a position where I'm further away from the goal or stuck. Moving down to (5, 2) will allow me to potentially create a path towards the goal.

Please let me know the updated maze.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a diagonal staircase or a staggered diagonal path.


Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same diagonal staircase shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 G 0 1 1 P 1

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is still a diagonal staircase or staggered diagonal path.
