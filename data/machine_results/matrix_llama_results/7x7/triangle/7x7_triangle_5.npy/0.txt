You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
0 G 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am starting at the position 'P' which is located at (3,3). The goal 'G' is at (6,1). My objective is to navigate to the goal through empty spaces while avoiding walls. 

After examining the maze, my first move will be to the position (4,3) since it is an empty space adjacent to my current position and avoids the wall to the left. 

However, it turns out (4,3) is not empty, but (3,4) and (3,5) are. Among those two positions, (3,5) seems a bit further from the goal but more flexible for the next step.

So, considering I am at (3,3), my next move will be to (3,5), the empty space to the right of my current position.

My next move coordinates: (3,5)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) an "L-shape" or an "L-corridor" (with some minor connections), since the empty spaces roughly form an L shape from the starting position to the goal.

To generate a new maze with the same size and the same shape, I will create a new 7x7 maze with an L-shaped corridor:

Here is the new maze:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 P 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 G 1 1 1 1 1

The new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is still an L-shape, as seen in the original maze.
