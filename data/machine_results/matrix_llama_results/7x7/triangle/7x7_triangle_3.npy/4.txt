You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G).

My current position is (5, 3), and my goal is (5, 0). 

My next move will be to move up and right diagonally to position (4, 2). However, this position has a wall. 

Instead, I can move to the adjacent empty space, which is (5, 2).

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (5, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
G 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (5, 2).

My next move will be to move left to position (5, 1).

The coordinates of my next move are (5, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
G P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (5, 1).

My goal is within reach! I can see that it's one step to the left.

The coordinates of my next move are (5, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, a valid path from P to G, and empty spaces that form an L-shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same 7x7 size as the original, and the empty spaces form an L-shape that connects the starting position P to the goal position G. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape and structure.
