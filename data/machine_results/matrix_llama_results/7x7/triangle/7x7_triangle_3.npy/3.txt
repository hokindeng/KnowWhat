You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves. To start, I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position 'P' and choose the most promising direction.

The current player position is at coordinates (5,3). After examining the adjacent positions, I find that I have two possible moves:

1. Up to (4,3)
2. Right to (5,4)

Both options are viable, but I will choose to move up to (4,3) as it seems to provide a more direct path to the goal 'G'.

My next move will be to coordinates (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 P 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position 'P'.

The current player position is at coordinates (4,3). After examining the adjacent positions, I find that I have three possible moves:

1. Up to (3,3)
2. Right to (4,4) 
3. Down to (5,3)

I will choose to move down to (5,3) as it seems to provide a direct path to the goal 'G'.

My next move will be to coordinates (5,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems I've returned to the previous position.

From the current player position 'P' at (5,3), I will reevaluate my options. I can move to the following positions:

1. Up to (4,3)
2. Right to (5,4)
3. Left to (5,2)

This time, I will choose to move left to (5,2) as it brings me closer to the goal 'G'.

My next move will be to coordinates (5,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
G 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting closer to the goal.

From the current player position 'P' at (5,2), I have two possible moves:

1. Up to (4,2)
2. Left to (5,1)

I will choose to move left to (5,1) as it brings me even closer to the goal 'G'.

My next move will be to coordinates (5,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
G P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm right next to the goal.

From the current player position 'P' at (5,1) and considering the goal 'G' is at (5,0), I will move up-left (diagonally or in a straight line if necessary, however considering it a single individual movement in the context of my broader answer)  to reach the goal position.

However, I must express it within the move limitations and expression of coordinates. Therefore, 

My next move will be to coordinates (5,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) a "Snake-like" or "S-shaped" path.

Here's a new maze with the same size and shape, but with a different layout:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 1
G 1 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze meets the criteria, having the same size as the original, a valid path from P to G, and a recognizable "Snake-like" or "S-shaped" path formed by the empty spaces (corridors).
