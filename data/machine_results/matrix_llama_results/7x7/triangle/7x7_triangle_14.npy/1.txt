You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position (5, 1). The updated coordinates will be (4 is the row and 1 is the column, but I have to move to 5,1, assuming the current position is (4,1)), since the player can move diagonally, I will move to the adjacent position which is (5,1).

However, please note that in a standard 2D grid representation, (5, 1) corresponds to the sixth row and the second column, considering 0-based indexing.

In the maze, this move corresponds to the position right below the current player position 'P'. I will wait for the updated maze to determine my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will make my next move to the position (5, 3). This move is to the right, two steps from the current player position.

In the maze, this move corresponds to the third column in the same row where the player 'P' is currently located, which contains an empty space '0'.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is an "L" shape, specifically an inverted L shape, as the empty spaces form a continuous path that turns at a 90-degree angle, creating the shape of an L.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size as the original, with empty spaces forming an L shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces also form an L shape, but with a slightly different orientation and placement within the maze. The player can navigate from the current position 'P' to the goal position 'G' through the empty spaces. The L shape formed by the corridors is still recognizable in this new maze.
