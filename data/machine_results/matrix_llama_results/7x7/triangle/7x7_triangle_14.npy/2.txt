You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position (5, 2), since it's an empty space directly below my current position (4, 1) and a good starting point to get closer to the goal.

My next move is: (5, 2)

Please update the maze with my new position and let me know if it's correct.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my current position at (5, 2), I notice that the goal position 'G' is diagonally two spaces to the right and none down from my current position. However, I'll aim to move one space to the right, which is an empty space and closer to the goal.

My next move is: (5, 3)

Please update the maze with my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 P G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my current position at (5, 3) and the goal 'G' directly to my right, I'll make my next move to the goal position.

My next move is: (5, 4)

If this move is correct, I should have reached the goal!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A "Hook" or an "L-shape" with an extension.

The corridors start from the bottom-left, extend to the right, and then curve upward, forming a hook-like shape. There is also a small extension to the left at the top of the hook.

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "Hook" shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it has a similar "Hook" shape formed by its empty spaces. The path from P to G can be reached by moving right, then up, and then right again.
