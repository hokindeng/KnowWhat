You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 G 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position
The current player position is represented by 'P' and is located at coordinates (5, 3) in the given maze.

## Step 2: Identify the goal position
The goal position is represented by 'G' and is located at coordinates (5, 5) in the given maze.

## Step 3: Examine the adjacent spaces to the current player position
Looking at the maze, the spaces adjacent to 'P' (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) are examined for empty spaces ('0'). The space directly below 'P' is a wall ('1'), the spaces above and to the sides of 'P' are walls ('1'), and the diagonals are also blocked by walls except for the lower left diagonal which is not directly accessible due to the wall directly below 'P'. However, the space to the left of 'P' is not a direct option but there's an empty space ('0') below the wall that blocks the way to the left of 'P', suggesting a potential path by moving diagonally down-left.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on available options
Considering the constraints, the next move should be towards the empty space that is more likely to lead to the goal without directly hitting a wall. Moving diagonally down-left is the best immediate option to avoid walls and potentially find a path to the goal.

## Step 5: Determine the exact coordinates of the next move
Given the current position is (5, 3), moving diagonally down-left means increasing the x-coordinate and decreasing the y-coordinate, resulting in new coordinates (6, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 6, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position
The current player position is represented by 'P' and is now located at coordinates (6, 2) in the given maze.

## Step 2: Identify the goal position
The goal position is still represented by 'G' and is located at coordinates (5, 5) in the given maze.

## Step 3: Examine the adjacent spaces to the current player position
Looking at the maze, the spaces adjacent to 'P' (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) are examined for empty spaces ('0'). The spaces directly above and to the sides of 'P' are walls ('1'), but there is an empty space to the right of 'P' at coordinates (6, 3), which could be a potential path towards the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on available options
Considering the constraints, the next move should be towards the empty space that is more likely to lead to the goal without directly hitting a wall. Moving right seems to be the most direct path that keeps options open for reaching the goal.

## Step 5: Determine the exact coordinates of the next move
Given the current position is (6, 2), moving right means keeping the x-coordinate the same and increasing the y-coordinate, resulting in new coordinates (6, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 6, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position
The current player position is represented by 'P' and is now located at coordinates (6, 3) in the given maze.

## Step 2: Identify the goal position
The goal position is still represented by 'G' and is located at coordinates (5, 5) in the given maze.

## Step 3: Examine the adjacent spaces to the current player position
Looking at the maze, the spaces adjacent to 'P' (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) are examined for empty spaces ('0'). The spaces directly above and to the left of 'P' are walls ('1'), but there is an empty space to the right of 'P' at coordinates (6, 4) and below 'P' at coordinates (7 is out of bounds), but most notably, there is an empty space diagonally up-right of 'P' at coordinates (5, 4), which could be a very direct path towards the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on available options
Considering the constraints, the next move should be towards the empty space that is more likely to lead to the goal without directly hitting a wall. Moving diagonally up-right would be an ideal move to get closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Determine the exact coordinates of the next move
Given the current position is (6, 3), moving diagonally up-right means decreasing the x-coordinate and increasing the y-coordinate, resulting in new coordinates (5, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 5, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
Looking at the original maze and the path taken to solve it, the general shape formed by the empty spaces can be identified. Given the constraints of the maze and the path taken, the shape appears to resemble an "L" shape with an additional corridor or a simplified "hook" shape, connecting the start to the goal.

## Step 2: Determine the exact name of the general shape
Based on the description in Step 1, the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is most accurately described as resembling an "L" shape with an extension or a hook-like appendage, but for simplicity and due to its primary characteristic, it can be considered a variant of an "L-shape".

## Step 3: Generate a new maze with the same size and shape of empty spaces
A new maze of the same size (7x7) needs to be created. This maze should have empty spaces forming an "L" shape, provide a valid path from 'P' to 'G', and not be an identical copy of the original maze.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original
Here is a new maze that fits the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

The final answer is: There is no numerical answer to this problem as it requests a descriptive answer of the shape and a newly generated maze meeting specific criteria, which were provided in the steps above.
