You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 G 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After analyzing the maze, I've decided on my first move.

My current position is at the "P", which is at coordinates (5,3). I'll move to the empty space directly below me, which is at coordinates (6,3).

So, my next move is to coordinates (6,3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I'll plan my next move accordingly!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After analyzing the updated maze, I've decided on my next move.

My current position is at the "P", which is at coordinates (6,3). I'll move to the empty space directly right of me, which is at coordinates (6,4).

So, my next move is to coordinates (6,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.My current position is at the "P", which is at coordinates (6,4). I'll move to the empty space directly right of me, which is at coordinates (6,5).

So, my next move is to coordinates (6,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting close!

My current position is at the "P", which is at coordinates (6,5). I'll move to the empty space directly up of me and one to the right, diagonally, which will get me closer to the goal. This new position is at coordinates (5,6).

However, looking at the maze, I notice I have to move diagonally to an empty square to progress, and moving diagonally up and right one will put me adjacent the G (goal) and also prevent me from immediately achieving the goal. So my next move is actually to (5,5).

No, my next move is to coordinates (5,5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A Staircase or a Zigzag pattern

The empty spaces form a zigzag shape, allowing the player to move from the starting point "P" to the goal "G".

Here's a new maze with the same size, where the empty spaces form a similar staircase or zigzag pattern:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 0

This new maze meets the criteria:

* It has the same size as the original maze (7x7)
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as a staircase or zigzag pattern.

Feel free to try to solve this new maze!
