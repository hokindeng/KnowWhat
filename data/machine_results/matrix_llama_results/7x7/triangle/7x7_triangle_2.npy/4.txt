You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 G 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the empty space directly below the current player position 'P'. The coordinates of my next move are (6,3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and present it to me again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the empty space directly to the right of the current player position 'P'. The coordinates of my next move are (6,4).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and present it to me again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will make my next move to the empty space directly to the right of the current player position 'P', again moving closer to the goal. However, I will also be mindful of the empty space directly above the current goal position. The coordinates of my next move are (6,5).



However, I am starting to envision the next several moves to avoid having to move backwards.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the empty space directly above the current player position 'P', moving closer to the goal position. The coordinates of my next move are (5,5).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and present it to me again.

My strategy is to position myself so that I can move diagonally to the goal position in the next step.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "staircase" or "L-shape with a diagonal connection".

Here is a new maze with the same size and shape, but with a different configuration:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 P 0 1 1 G
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a staircase or L-shape with a diagonal connection, but the position of the corridors and the location of the player and goal are different.
