You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position (1, 4), marked as 'P'. My goal is to reach position (4, 2), marked as 'G'. To do this, I will try to move in the most direct way possible while avoiding walls. Looking at the maze, I can see that there is an empty space to my right, at coordinates (1, 5).

My next move will be to (1, 5).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 P 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my current position at (1, 5), I see that there is an empty space directly below me, at coordinates (2, 5).

My next move will be to (2, 5).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 P 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2, 5). I need to find a way to move towards the goal position. Looking at the maze, I see that there is an empty space to my left, at coordinates (2, 4), but it's blocked by a wall below it, and there's also an empty space below the wall at (3, 4) but that also won't get me any closer to the goal. However, I can move down and then try to find a way to the goal from there.

However, there is an empty space directly below me at coordinates (3, 5).

My next move will be to (3, 5).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 P 1
1 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (3, 5). I notice that there is an empty space below me and to my left, at coordinates (4, 4), (4, 3) and (4, 2), which gets me closer to the goal. 

My next move will be to (4, 4).

Please update the maze accordingly

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 G 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (4, 4). I can see the goal position is directly adjacent to my current position, at coordinates (4, 2).

My next move will be to (4, 2).

This should put me at the goal position, ending the maze. 

Please update the maze accordingly and let me know if I've solved it!

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) an "L-shape" or an "elbow shape".

To create a new maze that meets the criteria, I will generate a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces that form the same L-shape. Here is the new maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and forms the same L-shape with its empty spaces. It is not an identical copy of the original maze, but rather a new instance of a maze with the same general shape.
