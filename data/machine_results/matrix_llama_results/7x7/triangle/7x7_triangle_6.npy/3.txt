You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 P
1 1 1 G 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (1, 6). My objective is to reach the goal G (2, 3). Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to my current position, I will look for the available options.

From my current position (1, 6), the adjacent empty spaces are:

- Up: Not possible (outside the maze)
- Down: (2, 6) is an empty space
- Left: (1, 5) is a wall
- Right: Not possible (outside the maze)
- Diagonal (up-left): Not possible (outside the maze)
- Diagonal (up-right): Not possible (outside the maze)
- Diagonal (down-left): (2, 5) is a wall
- Diagonal (down-right): Not possible (outside the maze)

Given the options, my next move will be to the down adjacent empty space. The coordinates of my next move are (2, 6). 

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 1 1 P
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (2, 6). My objective is to reach the goal G (2, 3). Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to my current position, I will look for the available options.

From my current position (2, 6), the adjacent empty spaces are:

- Up: (1, 6) is my previous position, but I can still move there if necessary
- Down: (3, 6) is an empty space
- Left: (2, 5) is a wall
- Right: Not possible (outside the maze)
- Diagonal (up-left): (1, 5) is a wall
- Diagonal (up-right): Not possible (outside the maze)
- Diagonal (down-left): (3, 5) is a wall
- Diagonal (down-right): Not possible (outside the maze)

However, considering my goal is at (2, 3) which is on the same row as my current position, I will try to move to an empty space that will help me to reach my goal. 

I notice that there is an empty space to the left of my goal G (2, 2), and there is a path through the empty space above my current position (1, 6) that might help me reach (2, 2) in the next steps.

So, I will move up to (1, 6) first, then try to navigate to the left in the next steps. The coordinates of my next move are (1, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 P
1 1 1 G 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back to the starting position!

From my current position (1, 6), I can move left to try to reach the empty space at (2, 2), which is closer to my goal G (2, 3). 

I will move left to (1, 5), but that's a wall. So, I will look for another option.

I can move left to (1, 4) or (1, 3), but those are walls as well. I can move left to (1, 2), which is an empty space, and it's a good starting point to try to reach (2, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are (1, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a zigzag path or an "S" shape.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


1 0 0 1 1 0 0
1 P 0 0 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 G
1 0 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is also an "S" shape, but it's not an identical copy of the original maze.
