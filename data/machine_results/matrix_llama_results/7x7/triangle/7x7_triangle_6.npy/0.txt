You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 P
1 1 1 G 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

First, I notice that the current player position (P) is at (1,6). The goal position (G) is at (2,3).

To reach the goal, I would like to move towards the left, trying to get closer to the goal. Since I can move diagonally, I will choose to move diagonally up-left to the position (1,5). However, I see that there is a wall (1) at (1,5), so that's not a valid move.

A better option would be to move left to the position (1,5). The new position is empty (0), so it's a valid move.

My next move is to position (1,5).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Next move coordinates: (1,5)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "inverted L-shape" or a "bent elbow" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same general shape:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 P
1 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze maintains the same size as the original, has a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original. The empty spaces form a recognizable inverted L-shape or bent elbow shape, similar to the original maze.
