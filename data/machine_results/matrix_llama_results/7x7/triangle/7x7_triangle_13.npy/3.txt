You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 P
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (2, 6). Since I can move to any adjacent empty space, I'll examine the available options.

After analyzing the maze, I've found the following possible moves from the current position (P):

* Moving up is not possible, as it's a wall.
* Moving down is possible to the coordinates (3, 6).
* Moving left is possible to the coordinates (2, 5).
* Moving right is not possible, as it's outside the maze boundaries.
* Moving diagonally up-left is not possible, as it's a wall.
* Moving diagonally up-right is not possible, as it's outside the maze boundaries.
* Moving diagonally down-left is possible to the coordinates (3, 5).
* Moving diagonally down-right is not possible, as it's outside the maze boundaries.

Considering the options, I decide to move diagonally down-left to the coordinates (3, 5). Since it's an empty space, it's a valid move.

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 5)

Please update the maze accordingly and let me know the next step.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I analyze the empty spaces and recognize that they form a general shape of a:

(1) Zigzag (or Z-shape)

The original maze has a zigzag shape formed by the corridors (empty spaces) that connect the current player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Now, I will generate a new maze with the same size and a zigzag-shaped path. Here is the new maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 P
1 0 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 G

This new maze meets the criteria:

* It has the same size as the original maze (7x7)
* It includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces is a recognizable zigzag (or Z-shape)

Note that the zigzag shape might not be a perfect, straight Z-shape, but it captures the essence of a winding path with alternating turns, characteristic of a zigzag.
