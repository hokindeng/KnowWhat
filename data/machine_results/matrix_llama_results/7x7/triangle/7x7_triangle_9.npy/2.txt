You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 G 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position (2,3).

Here is the thought process behind my decision:

1. I start by locating my current position, which is (1,3), marked by 'P'.
2. I identify the goal position (1,5), marked by 'G'.
3. I observe that the goal is two positions to the right of my current position.
4. However, there is a wall (1) separating the goal from my current position, so I cannot directly move right.
5. I analyze the possible moves: up, down, left, right, and diagonals.
6. I notice that the only viable moves from my current position are diagonally down-right to (2,4) or diagonally up-right is blocked by a wall, and a direct move right is also blocked by a wall.
7. However, I can move diagonally down-left to (2,3), which is an empty space (0).
8. Moving to (2,3) sets me up for a potential move to the goal in a subsequent step.

Therefore, I will move to the position (2,3).

Please update the maze with my new position and let me know the next step.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "S" shape or a reversed "S" shape.

This shape is recognizable because the empty spaces in the original maze form a winding path that resembles the letter "S" or its mirror image.

Here is a new maze with the same size as the original, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces that still form an "S" shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 0 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an "S" shape, similar to the original maze. However, the arrangement of the walls and empty spaces is different, providing a distinct solution path from P to G.
