You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 G 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at coordinates (1,3) and the goal position is at coordinates (1,5).

Since we can move in any of the eight adjacent directions (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), we should try to get closer to the goal. Let's move diagonally up and right to position (1,4).

However, this position is occupied by a wall (1). So, let's move to an empty space that is closer to the goal. Let's move right to position (1,4).

The new coordinates of the player's next move are (1,4).

Please update the maze and let me know the new state of the maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P G 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since the goal position (G) is right next to the player's current position (P), the next move is simple. Let's move right to the goal position.

The new coordinates of the player's next move are (1,5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L" shape.

The L-shaped corridor is formed by the empty spaces in the original maze, connecting the starting position (P) to the goal position (G).

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 G 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the L-shaped corridor connects the starting position (P) to the goal position (G), while avoiding walls and maintaining the same size and encoding as the original maze.
