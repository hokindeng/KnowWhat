You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position (4, 2), since it's an empty space that is adjacent to the current player position.

My reasoning is as follows:

* I'll start by analyzing the current player position (P), which is at coordinates (4, 1) considering the top-left corner as (0,0).
* I'll look for all the adjacent empty spaces, which are (4, 0), (3, 1), (5, 1), (3, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), and (3, 2).
* I'll eliminate the positions that are walls or out of bounds.
* I'll choose one of the remaining available options. In this case, I'll choose the position (4, 2).

Please let me know the updated maze after this move.

Move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the current state of the maze and plan my next move.

From the current player position (4, 2), I have the following adjacent empty spaces: (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2), and (3, 1). I'll choose one of these available options. In this case, I'll choose the position (4, 3).

My reasoning is to try to get closer to the goal position (G) by moving to an empty space that is adjacent to the current position.

Please let me know the updated maze after this move.

Move: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 3), I'll analyze the adjacent empty spaces: (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), and (3, 2). My next move will be to the position (3, 3).

I'm trying to move closer to the goal position (G) while avoiding the walls. Since the goal is at a position with a higher y-coordinate, I'll move in the upward direction to an adjacent empty space.

Please let me know the updated maze after this move.

Move: (3, 3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A "Hook" or "L" shape.

The empty spaces form a path that curves in an L-shape, connecting the starting position (P) to the goal position (G).

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 G 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces also form a Hook or L-shape, connecting the starting position (P) to the goal position (G). The maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces. However, it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
