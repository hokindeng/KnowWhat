You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at (0,0) and the goal 'G' is at (1,4). 

A possible next move would be to move right to (0,1) since it's an empty space.

My next move is: (0,1)

Please update the maze to reflect this new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I've moved one step to the right.

A possible next move would be to move right again to (0,2) since it's an empty space.

My next move is: (0,2)

Please update the maze to reflect this new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I've moved one step to the right again.

A possible next move would be to move right again to (0,3) since it's an empty space.

My next move is: (0,3)

Please update the maze to reflect this new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I've moved one step to the right again.

A possible next move would be to move right again to (0,4) since it's an empty space.

My next move is: (0,4)

Please update the maze to reflect this new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've reached the rightmost empty space on the first row. Now, I need to move downwards to make progress towards the goal.

A possible next move would be to move down to (1,4), but it's a wall. However, I can move down to the next available empty space, which is (2,4) and then try to find a way to the goal from there, but a better option would be to move down to (2,3) which doesn't put me further away from G in the column while also going down.

But since the goal G is on the second row, the most direct path to get closer to it would be to go down on the 4th column (index 3), but that is occupied by a wall, my next best is on the 3rd column (index 2) 2 rows down to the P position or the second best is the 5th column (index 4) because that is closer to G than going down from index 2 or 3 one row. However my current position does put me next to a 1 so I can move left from that position. 

However moving into index (1,3) position yields me an opportunity to be next to G so moving down again or hoping there is another space below index 4 in one of the future rows to allow closer.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I can see that the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a " serpentine or winding path" or " reverse J shape".


Here is a new maze with the same size, a valid path from P to G, and the same general shape of a winding path:


P 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1


Please note that the new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape of a winding path formed by the empty spaces.
