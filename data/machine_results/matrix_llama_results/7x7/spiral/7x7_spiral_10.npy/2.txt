You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by moving the player 'P' up. The new position for 'P' will be the empty space directly above it. Thus, my next move will be to the coordinates where the player will move.

Current position of P: (5,6)
New position of P after moving up: (4,6)

My next move is to (4,6).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the given maze, I will provide the required information.

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a " Zig-Zag" or a "Staircase" shape. The empty spaces create a winding path from the start (P) to the goal (G), which has a distinctive zig-zag or staircase pattern.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape of empty spaces (a zig-zag/staircase shape):

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 G
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same zig-zag/staircase shape, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces, making it distinct from the original maze. The player (P) can navigate from the bottom to the top (G) by moving through the empty spaces.
