You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
P 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by identifying the current player position (P) and exploring the available moves from that position.

Current player position (P) is at coordinates (3,0). From this position, I can move in the following directions:

- Right: (3,1) is blocked by a wall (1)
- Down: (4,0) is an empty space (0)
- Left and Up are not possible since they would be outside the bounds of the maze or blocked by walls.

Given the possible moves, I will choose to move down to (4,0).

Next move coordinates: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
P 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the current position (P) at coordinates (4,0) and explore possible moves.

From position (4,0), I can move in the following directions:

- Right: (4,1) is blocked by a wall (1)
- Down: (5,0) is an empty space (0)
- Up: (3,0) is the previous position, but it's also an empty space (0)
- Left: not possible since it would be outside the bounds of the maze

Given the options, I will choose to move down to (5,0).

Next move coordinates: (5,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
P 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (5,0), I have more possibilities to move. Here's the analysis:

- Right: (5,1) is an empty space (0)
- Down: not possible since it would be outside the bounds of the maze or blocked by walls
- Up: (4,0) is the previous position, but I'll consider other options first
- Left: not possible since it would be outside the bounds of the maze

I'll prioritize moving right to (5,1) since it seems to be a more open path.

Next move coordinates: (5,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 P 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting closer to the goal (G). From my current position (5,1), here are my options:

- Right: (5,2) is an empty space (0)
- Left: (5,0) is the previous position, but I'll consider other options first
- Up: (4,1) is blocked by a wall (1)
- Down: not possible since it would be outside the bounds of the maze or blocked by walls

Since moving right seems to bring me closer to the goal (G), I'll choose to move right to (5,2).

Next move coordinates: (5,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 P G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm almost there. From my current position (5,2), here are my options:

- Right: (5,3) is the goal position (G)
- Left: (5,1) is the previous position
- Up: (4,2) is blocked by walls and not a direct path to the goal
- Down: not possible since it would be outside the bounds of the maze or blocked by walls

Since moving right will take me directly to the goal position (G), I'll choose to move right to (5,3).

Next move coordinates: (5,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a zigzag path or, more specifically, a "meandering path" or "zigzag corridor".

Here's a new maze with the same size, a valid path from P to G, and the same general shape of the corridors (meandering path or zigzag corridor):


0 0 0 1 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 1 1
P 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note that this new maze meets the criteria, having a meandering path or zigzag corridor shape formed by its empty spaces, while not being an identical copy of the original maze.
