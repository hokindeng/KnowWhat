You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
P 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am starting at position 'P', which is located at coordinates (3,0). The goal 'G' is at coordinates (5,3). 

My current position is surrounded by walls to the left and right. The only possible moves are up or down. Moving up would put me at coordinates (2,0), but that space is also blocked by a wall. The only viable option is to move down to coordinates (4,0), which is an empty space.

Therefore, my next move will be to coordinates (4,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
P 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am at position 'P', which is located at coordinates (4,0). The goal 'G' is still at coordinates (5,3). 

My current position is still bounded by walls to the left and up. However, I can move down or right. Moving down would put me at coordinates (5,0), which is an empty space, but moving in this direction does not bring me closer to the goal.

To move towards the goal, I need to go right. The space to the immediate right is blocked by a wall, but I can see a possible path two spaces to the right, starting from coordinates (4,2) or further. I'll start by getting as close as I can to that opening. Since I am at coordinates (4,0) and I need to move to the right, the closest empty space to the right is at coordinates (4,2) (although it is not directly next to me), but there is an empty space at coordinates (4,1) that is adjacent to my current position that is closer, relative to moving in a positive horizontal direction toward (4,2). However I do not see a subscript notation/indications from you showing or that could be used for displaying blots and no connections uses or otherwise.


However moving to coordinates (4,1) is impossible as the subscript at these coordinates read :1.
 Thus instead my next move would be neither left, right or up but down instead; to  (5,0).

Therefore my next move will be to coordinates (5,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
P 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm glad I was able to move down to (5,0).

Now, I'm at position 'P' at coordinates (5,0), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (5,3). 

Since I'm on the same row as the goal, I just need to move right to reach the goal. The space to the immediate right is empty, so I can move there.

My next move will be to coordinates (5,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 P 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting closer to the goal.

I'm currently at position 'P' at coordinates (5,1), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (5,3). 

Since I'm still on the same row as the goal, I just need to move right again to reach the goal. The space to the immediate right is empty, so I can move there.

My next move will be to coordinates (5,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 P G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm almost there.

I'm currently at position 'P' at coordinates (5,2), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (5,3). 

Since I'm right next to the goal, my next move will be to coordinates (5,3), which is the goal position.

My next move will be to coordinates (5,3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "inverted U" or "arc" shape, where the empty spaces form a curved path that connects the starting point 'P' to the goal point 'G'.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "inverted U" or "arc" shape:

0 1 1 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
P 0 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze meets the criteria:

* Same size as the original maze (7x7)
* Includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces
* Not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an "inverted U" or "arc" shape.
