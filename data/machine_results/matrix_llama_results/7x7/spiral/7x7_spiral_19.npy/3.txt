You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 P
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (4, 5). My objective is to reach the goal G (5, 5). 

I will move to the position right above my current one, which is (4, 4). However, since we need to provide the coordinates in the format (row, column), I'll adjust accordingly.

My next move is to the coordinates: (3, 5)

This move is an optimal choice since it moves me closer to the goal while keeping me away from the walls and utilizing the available empty spaces effectively.

Please update the maze with my new position, and I will analyze and provide the next move accordingly.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or "L-corridor," but a more precise description is that it resembles an "inverted L-shape" with a turn and a short prolonged path at the end leading to G.

Here is a new maze with empty spaces that form the same shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 0 P 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, I have maintained the same shape of empty spaces forming an inverted L with a short extension to G, while changing the layout of the walls and placing of P and G within the maze to meet the conditions mentioned. This maze is not an identical copy of the original but retains the recognizable form of an inverted L shape that connects the starting position P to the goal position G.
