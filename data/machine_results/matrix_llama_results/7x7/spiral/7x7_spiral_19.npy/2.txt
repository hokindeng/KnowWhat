You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 P
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (4, 6). My objective is to reach the goal G (5, 6). Since I can move in the up, down, left, or right direction, I will look for adjacent empty spaces.

Moving down from my current position (4, 6) will lead me directly to the goal, but there's a wall between (4, 6) and the goal. I cannot move up because there is a wall. However, moving left from my current position will lead me to an empty space (4, 5). This will bring me closer to the goal or at least give me more movement options.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (4, 5).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "Z-Shape" or "a twisted/bent rectangle".

Now, I will provide a new maze that meets the specified criteria, having the same size (7x7) and empty spaces forming a similar Z-Shape.

Here is the new maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 P 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has a Z-Shape formed by its empty spaces, just like the original. The positions of the player (P) and the goal (G) are also inside this Z-Shape. The maze is solvable and the path can be reached through empty spaces while avoiding walls.
