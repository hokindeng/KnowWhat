You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 G 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Since the goal position (G) is at (3,4), I will aim to move in that direction while avoiding walls. My current position (P) is at (5,4). I can move either left or up to an empty space.

To maximize progress towards the goal, I will choose to move up. 

My next move will be to (4,4), as it is an empty space and brings me closer to the goal.

Please let me know the outcome of this move and present the updated maze.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I can conclude that:

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a winding path or a "meandering corridor" that allows movement from the start point (P) to the goal point (G).

To generate a new maze with the same characteristics:

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and a meandering corridor shape:

0 0 0 1 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 0 G 1
0 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a meandering corridor that allows the player to move from the start point (P) to the goal point (G) while avoiding walls. The maze has the same size as the original and is not an identical copy, but it retains the same general shape of the corridors.
