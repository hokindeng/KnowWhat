You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 P 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 G
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'd be happy to help solve the maze.

After analyzing the maze, I've decided on the next move. Currently, the player is at the position marked 'P' at coordinates (2, 2). To progress, I'll move the player to the adjacent empty space on the right, which is at coordinates (2, 3).

However, I see that there's a wall at (2, 3). In that case, I'll move the player down to (3, 2), which is an empty space.

So, my next move is to (3, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect this move and let me know the new maze configuration. I'll then plan the next move based on the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 P 1 0 1 G
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (3, 2) marked by 'P'. To make progress towards the goal, my next move will be to the right, to the coordinates (3, 3), but I see a wall there. Instead, I'll move down to the empty space below me, which is at coordinates (4, 2).

However, this move doesn't seem to bring me closer to the goal directly, so I'll reconsider. Since the goal 'G' is at (3, 5), I need to find a way to get closer to it. I'll move right to (3, 3) but since there's a wall, I'll try moving to the empty space on the left of my current position 'P', which is at (3, 1) but again there is a wall.

Upon reevaluating, I'll move to (4, 2) since that's the most viable move for now.

But wait, that doesn't seem to be efficient. Let me reevaluate: given the current state, I can actually try moving further left from the current position, but again I'll be blocked by a wall, but if I go down then right then it would take more moves, so the more efficient way is as previously noted.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 G
1 1 P 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (4, 2) marked by 'P'. To make progress towards the goal, my next move will be to the right, but I'm blocked by a wall at (4, 3). Instead, I'll move down to the empty space below me, which is at coordinates (5, 2).

This move should give me more options to progress towards the goal in the subsequent moves.

So, my next move is to (5, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 G
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (5, 2) marked by 'P'. To make progress towards the goal, I'll move to the right to the empty space, which is at coordinates (5, 3).

My next move is to (5, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 G
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (5, 3) marked by 'P'. To make progress towards the goal, I'll move to the right again to the empty space, which is at coordinates (5, 4).

My next move is to (5, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 G
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (5, 4) marked by 'P'. To make progress towards the goal, I'll move to the right again to the empty space, which is at coordinates (5, 5).

My next move is to (5, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 G
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (5, 5) marked by 'P'. To make progress towards the goal, I'll move up to the space above me, which is at coordinates (4, 5), but there is a wall there. I'll move up to the left of this wall to (4,4), but again there is a wall there, I'll move further left and up. But ultimately the most direct path to the goal is now available if I can take (4,5) but its blocked so going by the rest of the left most side I move up which brings me to (4, 5) having taken a different route.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path", with a long vertical section connected to a shorter horizontal section.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 G 0 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 P 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it has the same size and a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is also an L-shape.
