You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 P 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at the position 'P' which is located at (4,3). I have empty spaces above me at (3,3), to my right at (4,4), and below me does not look promising due to the wall at (5,3). Given these options, my best next move is to move right to the empty space at (4,4). 

My next move is: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 P 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4,4), I will evaluate my next move. 

I still have an empty space above me at (3,4), but that direction does not seem promising due to the wall at (2,4). I also have empty spaces to my right at (4,5) and below that is also an empty space. However, moving right seems like the most straightforward direction towards the goal 'G'. 

My next move is: (4,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 P 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4,5), I will look at my options. 

I can move to the right at (4,6) which is an empty space. However, I also have the option to move down to (5,5), but that doesn't seem promising as there is a wall at (5,5). Moving right will allow me to make progress towards the goal 'G'. 

My next move is: (4,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 P
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4,6), I will examine my options. 

Moving down at (5,6) is blocked by a wall, and moving right is also not possible as I am at the right boundary of the maze. However, I can move up to (3,6) which is an empty space, but that direction doesn't seem like it will lead me to the goal. My best option seems to be to backtrack to the left at (4,5), but I also notice that if I move down left diagonals are not a move so I must go (5,5) down and then left (No so I move left then down I do the two as 2 moves  move coordinate left 1 and then go down one).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "U-shaped" or " Rectangular U-shaped" 

Here's a new maze with the same size and shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 P 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
