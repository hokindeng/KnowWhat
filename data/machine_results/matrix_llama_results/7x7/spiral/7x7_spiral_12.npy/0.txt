You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 P 1 G
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (3,4). To navigate through the maze, I need to find an empty space ('0') that is adjacent to my current position in the up, down, left, or right direction.

Looking at the maze, I notice that there is an empty space above me at position (2,4). However, I also notice that this space is part of a narrow path that may lead to a dead end.

A more promising option is to move left to position (3,3). This space is adjacent to my current position and appears to be part of a more open path that could lead to the goal position G.

Therefore, my next move will be to the left, to position (3,3). The coordinates of my next move are (3,3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and provide the revised maze for my next decision.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "H" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and the same "H" shape formed by the empty spaces:


1 1 0 1 1 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 P 1 1 1 1 G
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is still recognizable as an "H" shape.
