You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (3, 2).

From this position, I will consider the adjacent empty spaces (0) as possible moves:

- Moving up: Not possible (blocked by wall)
- Moving down: Possible, but leads to a dead-end (for now, I won't move down)
- Moving left: Not possible (blocked by wall)
- Moving right: Possible (open path)

Considering the options, my next move is:

Move to coordinates (3, 3) is blocked by a wall, I will move to the right adjacent empty space, which is (3, is not an option, the correct movement is) coordinates (4, 2).

So, my next move will be to coordinates (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at coordinates (4, 2), I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (4, 2).

From this position, I will consider the adjacent empty spaces (0) as possible moves:

- Moving up: Not an optimal move (leads back to a previous position)
- Moving down: Possible, but leads to a dead-end or the need for a long route (for now, I won't move down, though moving down could be viable and lead to solving with more moves)
- Moving left: Not possible (blocked by wall)
- Moving right: Possible (open path)

Considering the options, my next move is:

Move to the right adjacent empty space, which is coordinates (4, 3).

So, my next move will be to coordinates (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at coordinates (4, 3), I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (4, 3).

From this position, I will consider the adjacent empty spaces (0) as possible moves:

- Moving up: Possible (leads to a path I have previously seen, though I will prioritize a horizontal movement to reach the goal more quickly)
- Moving down: Not possible (blocked by wall or already considered)
- Moving left: Possible (leads back to a previous position, which I will avoid to reduce moves)
- Moving right: Possible (open path)

Considering the options, my next move is:

Move to the right adjacent empty space, which is coordinates (4, 4).

So, my next move will be to coordinates (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at coordinates (4, 4), I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (4, 4).

From this position, I will consider the adjacent empty spaces (0) as possible moves:

- Moving up: Not ideal (leads to a previous position and is not the most direct route to the goal)
- Moving down: Not possible (blocked by wall)
- Moving left: Possible (leads back to a previous position, which I will avoid to reduce moves)
- Moving right: Possible (open path, which leads to the goal)

Considering the options, my next move is:

Move to the right adjacent empty space, which is coordinates (4, 5).

So, my next move will be to coordinates (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 P G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at coordinates (4, 5), I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (4, 5), and the goal (G) is adjacent to the current position.

- Moving up: Not necessary
- Moving down: Not possible (blocked by wall)
- Moving left: Possible (but I won't move away from the goal)
- Moving right: The goal is already at this position (coordinates (4, 6))

Considering the options, my next move is:

 Move to the goal, which is coordinates (4, 6).

The maze is now solved!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a winding or "serpentine" path.


Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a serpentine shape:


1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a serpentine path that can be navigated from the starting point (P) to the goal (G).
