You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am starting at the position 'P' which is located at (3,3). To solve the maze, my next move should be to an adjacent empty space (represented by '0'). Looking at the maze, a possible move is to go down from (3,3) to (4,3).

The coordinates of my next move are (4,3).

Please let me know the updated maze after my move. I'll be happy to continue solving it!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4,3), I have a few options for my next move. 

Since the goal 'G' is to my right, I should move in that direction to reduce the distance. My next move will be to the right, from (4,3) to (4,4).

The coordinates of my next move are (4,4).

Please let me know the updated maze after my move. I'll continue solving it!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm making progress!

Now that I'm at position (4,4), I should continue to move closer to the goal 'G'. My next move will be to the right, from (4,4) to (4,5).

The coordinates of my next move are (4,5).

Please let me know the updated maze after my move. I'm almost there!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 P G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4,5) and adjacent to the goal 'G', I can reach it!

My next move will be to the right, from (4,5) to (4,6).

The coordinates of my next move are (4,6).

Please confirm if I've successfully reached the goal!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Fun challenge!

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze appears to be a type of "L-shape" or a "bent corridor" that connects the top-left area to the bottom-right area.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces that form a similar L-shape:
```
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 P 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
This new maze has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape. Note that the maze is not an identical copy of the original, and the L-shape is oriented slightly differently.
