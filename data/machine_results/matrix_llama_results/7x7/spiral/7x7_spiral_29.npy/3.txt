You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by analyzing the possible moves from the current player position 'P'.

The maze with the current position marked as (x, y) is:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

The current position of 'P' is (5, 3), considering the top-left corner as (0, 0).

The next move will be to an adjacent empty space. There are two possible empty spaces: the one to the left at (5, 2) or the one to the right at (5, 4). I will choose the one to the left as it appears to be a more direct path to the goal position 'G'.

The coordinates of my next move are (5, 2).

Please provide the updated maze based on my move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze to determine the next move.

Considering the current position of 'P' at (5, 2), the goal 'G' is located above the current position. However, there is a wall at (4, 2) that blocks the direct path.

Upon examining the maze, I see a possible path to the left. The coordinates of my next move will be (5, 1), moving one step to the left.

The coordinates of my next move are (5, 1).

Please provide the updated maze based on my move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current position of 'P' at (5, 1).

Since I've moved to the left, the next step would be to try to move up and get closer to the goal 'G'. I see that the space directly above the current position at (4, 1) is empty.

The coordinates of my next move will be (4, 1), moving one step up.

Please provide the updated maze based on my move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze to determine the next move.

Since I've moved up, I can see that the path to the goal 'G' is getting closer. The goal is located two steps to the right and one step up from the current position.

However, there is a wall above the current position at (3, 1), so I will move right instead. The space to the right of the current position at (4, 2) is not accessible because of a wall, but the space to the right of that, at (4, 3) and (4, 4) and beyond are not accessible either, so I will move up is not an option now. But the space two steps right of the current position at (4, 3) is not acessible. I see a possible path, the coordinates of my next move will be (3 is not an option, so 4, 0), moving one step to the left.

The coordinates of my next move are (4, 0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "H-shape" or a " Double-T" but with the horizontal bars slanted to adapt it to the 7x7 maze, the closer definition will be:
 (1) a Distorted Double-T shape.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and has a general shape formed by its empty spaces that is recognizable as a Distorted Double-T shape.
