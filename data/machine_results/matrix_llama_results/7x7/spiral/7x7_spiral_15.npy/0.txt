You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by moving the player position 'P' to the adjacent empty space on the right. The new coordinates will be (0, 2).

Here's my thought process:

Current player position 'P' is at (0, 1). The possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 0) is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Down: (1, 1) is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Left: (0, 0) is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Right: (0, 2) is an empty space, so it's a valid move.

The coordinates of my next move are (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will move the player position 'P' to the adjacent empty space on the right. The new coordinates will be (0, 3).

Here's my thought process:

Current player position 'P' is at (0, 2). The possible moves are:
- Up: ( row doesn't exist above the current position), so it's not a valid move.
- Down: (1, 2) is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Left: (0, 1) is an empty space, but it's already been visited, so I will prioritize moving to a new space.
- Right: (0, 3) is an empty space, so it's a valid move.

The coordinates of my next move are (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will move the player position 'P' to the adjacent empty space on the right. The new coordinates will be (0, 4).

Here's my thought process:

Current player position 'P' is at (0, 3). The possible moves are:
- Up: (row doesn't exist above the current position), so it's not a valid move.
- Down: (1, 3) is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Left: (0, 2) is an empty space, but it's already been visited, so I will prioritize moving to a new space.
- Right: (0, 4) is an empty space, so it's a valid move.

The coordinates of my next move are (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will move the player position 'P' to the adjacent empty space on the right. The new coordinates will be (0, 5).

Here's my thought process:

Current player position 'P' is at (0, 4). The possible moves are:
- Up: (row doesn't exist above the current position), so it's not a valid move.
- Down: (1, 4) is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Left: (0, 3) is an empty space, but it's already been visited, so I will prioritize moving to a new space.
- Right: (0, 5) is an empty space, so it's a valid move.

The coordinates of my next move are (0, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I've reached the rightmost edge of the maze, my next move will be downwards. The new coordinates will be (1, 5).

Here's my thought process:

Current player position 'P' is at (0, 5). The possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible, as there's no space above.
- Down: (1, 5) is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
- Left: (0, 4) is an empty space, but I've already been to the left, so I'll try to move down to explore new areas.
- Right: Not possible, as there's a wall to the right.

The coordinates of my next move are (1, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 P 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will move the player position 'P' downwards to the next empty space. The new coordinates will be (2, 5).

Here's my thought process:

Current player position 'P' is at (1, 5). The possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 5) is an empty space, but I've already been there, so I'll try to move down to explore new areas.
- Down: (2, 5) is not a straightforward option, as there's a wall below, however considering the given maze, if I go left first then go down would be a suboptimal move. A similar situation exists if I go up. Given that (2,5) has an empty space to its left on (2,4) it would benefit going to (2,5) for now in order to be next to that space.
- Left: (1, 4) is not an empty space, so it's not a valid move.
- Right: Not possible, as there's a wall to the right.

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 5) then possibly later (2,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(modified or imperfect) zigzag" shape, winding from the top-left (P) to the bottom-right (G) part of the maze.

Here is a new maze that meets the specified criteria:


1 P 0 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has a valid path from P to G, with empty spaces forming a zigzag shape similar to the original maze.
