You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by identifying the current player position (P) and analyzing the available moves from that position.

Current player position (P) is at coordinates (0,1), considering the top left corner as (0,0).

From this position, I can analyze the adjacent cells:

- Moving up is not possible because there's a wall (1) at (0,0).
- Moving down is possible to the empty space (0) at (0,2).
- Moving left is not possible because there's a wall (1) at (-1,1), which is out of the maze bounds anyway.
- Moving right is possible to the empty space (0) at (0,2), but since moving down also leads to the same column, I prefer to move right for potential future options.

However, given the layout and my initial analysis, I've decided it's more logical to correct my move to going down, as there's no immediate advantage to moving right over moving down, and moving down follows the conventional left-to-right, top-to-bottom exploration strategy which might align better with finding an efficient path.

So, my next move is down to coordinates (1,1). Please update the maze accordingly.

Corrected Decision: My next move will actually be to the right to (0,2) following the given instructions and realizing moving right is the logical first step given the constraints of the maze provided and seeking to follow instructions precisely in a corrected capacity.

The best immediate move from the starting position to maintain flexibility and start solving the maze given its constraints and my initial analysis correction is to:

Move right to (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (0,2). Now I need to decide where to move next.

Current player position (P) is at coordinates (0,2).

From this position, I can analyze the adjacent cells:

- Moving up is not possible because there's a wall (1) at (0,1), no, actually, there is a '0', an empty space at (0,1).
- Moving down is possible to the empty space (0) but it leads directly to a wall at (1,2).
- Moving left is possible back to the previous position, but that's not progress.
- Moving right is possible to the next empty space (0) at (0,3).

My next logical move, given the layout, is to move right, exploring more empty spaces while avoiding walls and trying to find a path towards the goal.

So, my next move is to (0,3).

Move right to (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Current player position (P) is at coordinates (0,3).

From this position, I can analyze the adjacent cells:

- Moving up is not possible because there's a wall (1) at the top, no empty space above to move into.
- Moving down is possible to the empty space (0) but there's a wall directly below at (1,3).
- Moving left is possible back to the previous position, but that's not progress.
- Moving right is possible to the next empty space (0) at (0,4).

My next logical move, given the layout, is to move right again, continuing to explore empty spaces while avoiding walls and trying to find a path towards the goal.

So, my next move is to (0,4).

Move right to (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Current player position (P) is at coordinates (0,4).

From this position, I can analyze the adjacent cells:

- Moving up is not possible because there's a wall (1) at the top, no empty space above to move into.
- Moving down is possible to the space below, but it leads to a wall at (1,4).
- Moving left is possible back to the previous position, but that's not progress.
- Moving right is possible to the next empty space (0) at (0,5), which could potentially lead closer to the goal.

My next logical move, given the layout, is to move right again, exploring more empty spaces while avoiding walls and trying to find a path towards the goal.

So, my next move is to (0,5).

Move right to (0,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Current player position (P) is at coordinates (0,5).

From this position, I can analyze the adjacent cells:

- Moving up is not possible because there's a wall (1) at the top, no empty space above to move into.
- Moving down is possible to the empty space (0) below, but it leads directly to a path that needs to be explored further for potential progress.
- Moving left is possible back to the previous position, but that's not progress.
- Moving right is not possible because there's a wall (1) to the right.

Given the current position and the layout of the maze, moving down seems to be the most logical move to make progress towards the goal.

So, my next move is down to (1,5).

Move down to (1,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 P 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Current player position (P) is at coordinates (1,5).

From this position, I can analyze the adjacent cells:

- Moving up is possible to the empty space (0) above, but that's going back.
- Moving down is not possible because there's a wall (1), no, actually, the wall is to the right and below that a 1 is present, however at (2,5) there is a '0'.
- Moving left is not possible directly to the left due to the presence of a '1', but there are potential paths that could open up to the left if I can move around the '1' wall.
- Moving right is not possible because there's a wall (1).

Given the current position and the layout of the maze, moving down is a potential path that needs to be explored further for progress towards the goal.

So, my next move is down to (2,5).

 Move down to (2,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 P 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Current player position (P) is at coordinates (2,5).

From this position, I can analyze the adjacent cells:

- Moving up is possible to the empty space (0) above, but that's going back to the previous position.
- Moving down is possible to the space below containing the goal (G).
- Moving left is not possible directly due to the presence of a '1', but exploring this direction could potentially lead to finding an alternative path to the goal or looping around to the goal from a different direction.
- Moving right is not possible because there's a wall (1).

Given the current position and the layout of the maze, moving down seems to be the most direct and logical move to make progress towards the goal.

So, my next move is down to (3,5), where the goal (G) is located.

 Move down to (3,5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path", but more specifically, a modified or irregular version of a "staircase" or "zig-zag" path is also present.

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "staircase" or "zig-zag" shape:


1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and its empty spaces form a similar "staircase" or "zig-zag" shape.
