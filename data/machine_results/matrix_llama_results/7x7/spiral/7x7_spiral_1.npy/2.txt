You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 P 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move. 

To start, I'll identify the coordinates of my current position (P) and the goal position (G). I'll also examine the surrounding area to determine the feasible moves.

After examining the maze, I see that my current position 'P' is at (3,3) and the goal position 'G' is at (5,5).

My current position is (3,3), and the surrounding area has empty spaces in the left and right directions. I can move left to (3,2) or right, but there's a wall to my right, so I can only move left.

My next move will be to the left, to coordinates (3,2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position. I'd like to see the updated maze to plan my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 P 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my current position 'P' at (3,2) and the goal position 'G' at (5,5), I need to find a path to reach 'G'.

Examining the maze, I notice that there's an empty space above my current position, at (2,2). However, that would require me to move up, and there's a wall above that empty space, blocking my potential path. I also see that there's an empty space to my right at (3,3), which I previously occupied.

A better option is to move up is not feasible due to the wall, but I can move down. I see an empty space below my current position, at (4,2).

My next move will be down to coordinates (4,2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position. I'd like to see the updated maze to plan my next move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a rectangle with an "S" bend or a "dog leg" shape, where the main path from P to G bends around a blockage. This shape is often referred to as an "L-shape with a kink" or more formally, a " rectilinear 'L' shape with an inflection".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7), with empty spaces that form the same L-shape with an inflection:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze includes a valid path from P to G, is not identical to the original maze, and the empty spaces form an L-shape with a kink.
