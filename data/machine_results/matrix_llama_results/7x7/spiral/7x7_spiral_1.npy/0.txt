You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 P 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position (3, 3), marked as 'P'. My goal is to reach position (5, 5), marked as 'G'. To get there, I need to move through the empty spaces while avoiding the walls.

Upon analyzing the maze, I notice that I can move in two possible directions: up or right. However, if I move up, I will be blocked by the walls, and there's no clear path to the goal. On the other hand, if I move right, I will have more options to progress towards the goal.

Considering this, my next move will be to move right to position (3, 4). However, since there is a wall at position (3, 4), I will move right and then down to position (4, 4), but that is two moves, so for the next move I will move down to (4, 3).

The coordinates of my next move are (4, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a zigzag.

(2) Here is a new maze with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original maze (7x7), includes a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces, and forms a zigzag shape. It is not an identical copy of the original maze.
