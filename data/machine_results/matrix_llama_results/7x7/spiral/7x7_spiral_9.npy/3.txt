You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 G 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 P 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am starting at the position 'P' which is located at the coordinates (5, 2). The goal is located at the position 'G' which is located at the coordinates (3, 4).

Considering my current position and the surrounding environment, my next move will be to move up, which is the position located at the coordinates (4, 2).

Please provide the updated maze after this move, and I will then plan the next step based on the new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 G 1 0
1 1 P 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

From my current position 'P' which is now located at the coordinates (4, 2), I will try to move closer to the goal 'G'. One possible move is to move up again, which is the position located at the coordinates (3, 2).

Please provide the updated maze after this move, and I will then plan the next step based on the new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 P 1 G 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting closer to the goal.

From my current position 'P' which is now located at the coordinates (3, 2), I notice that the goal 'G' is to my right. However, there's a wall in between us. I'll need to find a way to move around it.

My next move will be to move right and up isn't possible, so I will move right and down is possible by first moving down. I will move down, which is the position located at the coordinates (4, 2) however that is my old position, but then after that I can move to the right to (4,3) then I can proceed up. 

But the first move I need is down so I will move down which is the position (4, 2).

Please provide the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 G 1 0
1 1 P 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at the position (4, 2), my next move will be to move to the right, which is the position located at the coordinates (4, 3).

Please provide the updated maze after this move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag path" or a "serpentine path".

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zig-zag path shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 G
1 1 0 1 0 0 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 1 0 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces also form a zig-zag path that allows the player to move from P to G. The path is not identical to the original maze, but the overall shape of the corridors remains the same.
