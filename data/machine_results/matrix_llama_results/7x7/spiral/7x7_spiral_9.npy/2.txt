You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 G 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 P 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Currently, I am at the position marked 'P', which is located at coordinates (5, 2). I want to move towards the goal 'G' at coordinates (3, 4). 

Looking at the possible moves from my current position, I see that I can move up or left to an empty space. Since my goal is to the north-east, moving up makes more sense. 

Therefore, I will move up. The new coordinates will be (4, 2). 

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 G 1 0
1 1 P 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am now at coordinates (4, 2), marked 'P'. To reach the goal 'G', I need to navigate through the empty spaces. Looking at the possible moves, I see that I can move up, but it would put me back in a previously visited position. I can also move left or right. Since my goal is to the north-east, moving right doesn't bring me closer to the goal. Moving left seems more promising.

I will move left. The new coordinates will be (4, 1).

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "inverted L" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "inverted L" shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 G
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 P 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces (represented by '0') form an "inverted L" shape, similar to the original maze. The path from 'P' to 'G' is not identical to the original maze, but it still follows the same general shape.
