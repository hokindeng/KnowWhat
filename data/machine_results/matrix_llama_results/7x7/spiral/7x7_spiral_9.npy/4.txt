You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 G 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 P 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by identifying the current player position (P) and the goal position (G). The current player position is at (5, 2) and the goal position is at (3, 4).

To navigate from the current player position to the goal position, I will explore possible adjacent empty spaces. Since I can move in the up, down, left, or right direction, I will analyze the available options.

Looking at the maze, the possible adjacent empty spaces to the current player position are up (5, 1) which is blocked by a wall, down (6, 2) which is an empty space, left (5, 1) which is blocked by a wall, and right (5, 3) which is blocked by a wall.

Therefore, my next move will be to move down to the empty space at coordinates (6, 2) -> (6 is the row, 2 is the column).

Next move: (6, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 G 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the current player position (P) and the goal position (G). The current player position is at (6, 2) and the goal position is still at (3, 4).

To navigate from the current player position to the goal position, I will explore possible adjacent empty spaces. Since I can move in the up, down, left, or right direction, I will analyze the available options.

Looking at the maze, the possible adjacent empty spaces to the current player position are up (5, 2) which is an empty space, down is not possible as I am at the bottom edge, left (6, 1) which is blocked by a wall, and right (6, 3) which is an empty space.

Therefore, my next move will be to move up to the empty space at coordinates (5, 2).

Next move: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 G 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 P 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the current player position (P) and the goal position (G). The current player position is at (5, 2) and the goal position is still at (3, 4).

To navigate from the current player position to the goal position, I will explore possible adjacent empty spaces. Since I can move in the up, down, left, or right direction, I will analyze the available options.

Looking at the maze, the possible adjacent empty spaces to the current player position are up (4, 2) which is an empty space, down (6, 2) which is an empty space, left (5, 1) which is blocked by a wall, and right (5, 3) which is blocked by a wall.

To move closer to the goal, my next move will be to move up to the empty space at coordinates (4, 2).

Next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 G 1 0
1 1 P 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the current player position (P) and the goal position (G). The current player position is at (4, 2) and the goal position is still at (3, 4).

To navigate from the current player position to the goal position, I will explore possible adjacent empty spaces. Since I can move in the up, down, left, or right direction, I will analyze the available options.

Looking at the maze, the possible adjacent empty spaces to the current player position are up (3, 2) which is an empty space, down (5, 2) which is an empty space, left (4, 1) which is blocked by a wall, and right (4, 3) which is blocked by a wall, however (4,4) has a empty space.

However (3,2) and (3,3) lead to (3,4), the space with a G. 

My next move will be to move up to the empty space at coordinates (3, 2).

Next move: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 P 1 G 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the current player position (P) and the goal position (G). The current player position is at (3, 2) and the goal position is still at (3, 4).

Since I am now on the same row as the goal, I will try to move to the right to reach the goal.

My next move will be to move right to the empty space adjacent to the goal at coordinates (3, 3), no empty space exists there, however a empty space is there at the goal position coordinate's x axis +1 is blocked, however the path with the G has the y coordinate equal to the player so a movement along the y axis is not required , move along the x axis i.e (3, 4).

Instead my next move will be to move right to the goal position at coordinates (3, 4).

Next move: (3, 4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L-shape" or an "Elbow shape"

To create a new maze that meets the criteria, I will generate a new maze with the same size as the original and include a valid path from P to G that forms an L-shape. Here is the new maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 G
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 0

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that forms an L-shape. The empty spaces in the new maze are arranged differently than in the original, making it a distinct maze.
