You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
0 G 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'd be happy to help solve the maze.

After analyzing the maze, I've found the current player position (P) at coordinates (5, 5) and the goal position (G) at coordinates (6, 1).

My next move would be to move up from the current position (5, 5) to the empty space above it. The new coordinates would be (5, 4).

So, my next move is to (5, 4). Please update the maze accordingly.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "Inverted U" shape or an "Arch" shape. It has a wide opening at the bottom, curving up and then narrowing at the top.

(2) Here's a new maze with empty spaces forming the same "Inverted U" or "Arch" shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
0 G 0 0 0 0 1


This new maze has the same size as the original maze, and it forms the same "Inverted U" or "Arch" shape with its empty spaces. The path from P to G is valid and can be reached through empty spaces, and it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
