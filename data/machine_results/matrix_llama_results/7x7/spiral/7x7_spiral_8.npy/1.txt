You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 P 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by moving the player from the current position 'P' at coordinates (4,1) to the empty space above it at coordinates (3,1).

Next move coordinates: (3,1)

Please update the maze and provide it to me so I can plan the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will move the player from the current position 'P' at coordinates (3,1) to the empty space to its left at coordinates (3,0).

However, I noticed that would lead to a position that is not closer to the goal. A more strategic move would be to go down to coordinates (4,1), as that would allow for a clearer path towards the goal.

Next move coordinates: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 P 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at coordinates (4,1), my next move will be to the right, to the empty space at coordinates (4,2).

Next move coordinates: (4,2)

This move should put me in a position to continue moving towards the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 P 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position 'P' at coordinates (4,2), I will move to the right again, to the empty space at coordinates (4,3).

Next move coordinates: (4,3)

This move continues to bring me closer to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 P 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position 'P' at coordinates (4,3), I will move up to the empty space at coordinates (3,3).

Next move coordinates: (3,3)

This move aims to bring me even closer to the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "inverted-L" shape or a "bottleneck" shape, but it's more specifically reminiscent of an "L-shape with a corridor". However, I'm going to simplify the classification of this shape to an "L-shape" for the purpose of this exercise.

Here is a new maze with the same size as the original, with empty spaces forming the same L-shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 P 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

This new maze has a valid path from P to G and is not an identical copy of the original maze, while maintaining the L-shape formed by the empty spaces.
