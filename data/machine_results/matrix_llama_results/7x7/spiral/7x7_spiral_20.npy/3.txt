You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
P 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by identifying the coordinates of the current player position (P) and the goal position (G). The player position is at (6,0) and the goal position is at (3,0).

To navigate towards the goal position, my next move will be to move up to the adjacent empty space. The new coordinates of my next move will be (5,0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and provide it to me again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 1 0
P 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (5,0), I can see that moving up is still the best direction to head towards the goal (G) at (3,0).

My next move will be to move up again, so the new coordinates of my next move will be (4,0).

Please update the maze again to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting closer to the goal. Since I'm now at position (4,0), my next move will again be to move up to the adjacent empty space.

My next move will be to position (3,1), but wait, that's not possible since it's blocked by the wall. Instead, I can try to move to the right and see if I can find an alternative path.

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that moving up is not entirely blocked, since I can move up to position (3,0) which is the goal! So my next move will be to position (3,0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, or let me know if I've solved the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path", since it has a distinct right-angled turn near the goal position.

Here is a new maze with the same size (7x7) and an L-shaped path:

0 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 0 0 0 1
P 0 1 0 1 1 1
0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 0 0

This new maze has an L-shaped path from the starting position (P) to the goal position (G), but the layout is different from the original maze.
