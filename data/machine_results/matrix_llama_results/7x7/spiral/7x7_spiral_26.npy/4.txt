You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by identifying the current player position (P) and the goal position (G). The current player position is at coordinates (6,3), and the goal position is at coordinates (1,5).

To make my first move, I will analyze the adjacent positions to the current player position. The possible moves are up, down, left, or right. Since I want to move closer to the goal, I will move up.

However, since the position directly above the current player position is blocked by a wall (1), I will move left instead.

My next move will be to coordinates (6,2).

Please update the maze with my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the adjacent positions to the current player position. I can move up, down, left, or right.

Since I want to move closer to the goal, and I was previously blocked by the wall above, I will continue moving left.

My next move will be to coordinates (6,1).

Please update the maze with my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved left, I will analyze the adjacent positions to the current player position. I can move up, down, left, or right.

Since I want to move closer to the goal, I will try moving up. The position directly above the current player position is not blocked.

My next move will be to coordinates (5,1).

However, the position directly above that one, at (4,1), appears to be empty as well, which means that position (5,1) is likely also empty.

So I will then move up to (4,1) afterwards, if the position is indeed empty.

But first, my next move will be to coordinates (5,1).

Please update the maze with my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 P 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the adjacent positions to the current player position. I can move up, down, left, or right.

Since I want to move closer to the goal, and the position directly above the current player position at coordinates (4,1) is empty, I will move up.

However, the position directly above the position at (4,1), at (3,1), is blocked by a wall (1).

Since I can move up to position (4,1) though, that is what I will do.

My next move will be to coordinates (4,1).

Please update the maze with my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 P 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the adjacent positions to the current player position. I can move up, down, left, or right.

Since I want to move closer to the goal, I will try moving up. The position directly above the current player position is blocked by a wall (1).

However, moving left appears to be an option.

My next move will be to coordinates (4,0).

Please update the maze with my new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(distorted) stairway" or an "offset zigzag".

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 P 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces in this maze form a distorted stairway or offset zigzag shape, similar to the original maze.
