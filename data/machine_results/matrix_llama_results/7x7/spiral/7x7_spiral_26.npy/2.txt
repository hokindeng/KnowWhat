You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by analyzing the possible moves from the current player position 'P', which is located at coordinates (6, 3).

The maze is:
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0 0 0
```

My possible moves are:
- Up: (6, 2) is a '0', which is an empty space. However, considering the overall path to the goal, I'll avoid moving up for now.
- Down: Not possible since I'm at the bottom row.
- Left: (6, 2) is a '0', which is an empty space.
- Right: (6, 4) is a '0', which is an empty space.

Given these options, my best move to start navigating towards the goal position 'G' while avoiding walls and trying to find the optimal path is to move left to (6, 2).

Next move: (6, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the possible moves from the current player position 'P', which is now located at coordinates (6, 2).

The maze is:
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0 0 0
```

My possible moves are:
- Up: (5, 2) is a '0', which is an empty space.
- Down: Not possible since I'm at the bottom row.
- Left: (6, 1) is a '0', which is an empty space.
- Right: (6, 3) is a '0', which is the space I just came from, but it's still an option.

Considering my goal to navigate towards 'G', I'll choose the left option to move closer to the potential path that might lead me upwards.

Next move: (6, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the possible moves from the current player position 'P', which is now located at coordinates (6, 0).

The maze is:
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0 0 0
```

My possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible since there's a '1' (wall) above me.
- Down: Not possible since I'm at the bottom row.
- Left: Not possible since I'm at the leftmost column.
- Right: (6, 1) is a '0', which is an empty space.

Considering my goal to navigate towards 'G', I need to move upwards, but since I'm blocked by the wall, I'll move right to find another potential path.

Next move: (6, 1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a winding path, but a more distinct shape can be noticed, resembling a "serpentine" or "zigzag" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a similar zigzag shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 G
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 0 0 P
