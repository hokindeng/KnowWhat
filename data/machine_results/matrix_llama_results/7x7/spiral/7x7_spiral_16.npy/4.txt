You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 P 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. First, let's identify the current player position, which is represented by 'P'. It's located at coordinates (0,1).

To make the next move, I need to examine the adjacent cells. The possible moves from the current position 'P' at (0,1) are:

- Up: Not possible because there's a wall at (0,0).
- Down: Possible, as there's an empty space at (1,1).
- Left: Not possible because there's a wall at (0,0).
- Right: Possible, as there's an empty space at (0,2).

Considering the goal is to eventually reach 'G', moving down doesn't seem to bring us closer to the goal in the most straightforward manner at this stage, but moving right does seem like a more direct path towards our goal.

However, let's prioritize avoiding being trapped and consider the future moves carefully. For now, moving right seems like the best choice to keep our options open for reaching 'G'.

So, my next move is to (0,2), which is an empty space.

Please update the maze accordingly by moving 'P' from (0,1) to (0,2).

Updated position coordinates:
- (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 P 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll examine the adjacent cells to the current position 'P' at (0,2).

The possible moves from the current position are:

- Up: Not possible because there's a wall at (0,1) actually there is a '0' at (0,1) but our last position was (0,1) and we just came from that spot, moving up would only undo our progress
- Down: Possible, as there's an empty space at (1,2).
- Left: Possible, as there's an empty space at (0,1), again this is our last position and undo's progress
- Right: Possible, as there's an empty space at (0,3).

To keep moving towards the goal 'G', moving right seems to be the best choice.

So, my next move is to (0,3).

Please update the maze accordingly by moving 'P' from (0,2) to (0,3).

Updated position coordinates:
- (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 P 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll examine the adjacent cells to the current position 'P' at (0,3).

The possible moves from the current position are:

- Up: Not possible because there's a wall at (0,2) (No wall but that is the last position and undoes progress)
- Down: Possible, as there's an empty space is not available but an empty space exists at (1,3) if the column shifted to the right one, if (1,3) became (1,4) a move down at current column then becomes available at (1,4).
- Left: Possible, as there's an empty space at (0,2), which we came from.
- Right: Possible, as there's an empty space at (0,4).

Since moving left only undoes progress, and moving down isn't immediately possible, the best choice seems to be moving right, as it allows us to continue towards the goal 'G'.

However, we also need to consider the future steps and potential paths. Given that our goal is to eventually move down, and there seems to be an opportunity to do so by continuing to move right, we'll continue that way for now.

So, my next move is to (0,4).

Please update the maze accordingly by moving 'P' from (0,3) to (0,4).

Updated position coordinates:
- (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 P 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll examine the adjacent cells to the current position 'P' at (0,4).

The possible moves from the current position are:

- Up: Not possible because it is the top row and no empty space above us and there is a wall, but also this (No wall, already at top row) option does nothing but undo progress if a space did exist above.
- Down: Possible, as there's an empty space at (1,4).
- Left: Possible, as there's an empty space at (0,3), but this only undoes progress.
- Right: Possible, as there's an empty space at (0,5).

Considering the options, moving down seems like the best choice, as it allows us to make progress towards the goal 'G' and escape the top row. Moving right also seems viable, but for now, let's prioritize moving down to explore new paths.

So, my next move is to (1,4).

Please update the maze accordingly by moving 'P' from (0,4) to (1,4).

Updated position coordinates:
- (1,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After examining the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a winding or meandering "staircase-like" shape that connects the top left (P) to the bottom right (G). It can also be seen as a roughly "Z-like" shape due to its zigzag nature.

For the new maze, I'll generate one that meets the criteria:

1 0 0 0 P 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and features a similar winding or "Z-like" shape formed by its empty spaces. Note that the empty spaces in this new maze create a somewhat mirrored version of the original "staircase-like" or "Z-like" shape.
