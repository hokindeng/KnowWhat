You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 P 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. First, let's identify the current player position, which is represented by 'P'. It's located at coordinates (0,1).

To make the next move, I need to examine the adjacent cells. The possible moves from the current position 'P' at (0,1) are:

- Up: Not possible because there's a wall at (0,0).
- Down: Possible, as there's an empty space at (1,1).
- Left: Not possible because there's a wall at (0,0).
- Right: Possible, as there's an empty space at (0,2).

Considering the goal is to eventually reach 'G', moving down doesn't seem to bring us closer to the goal in the most straightforward manner at this stage, but moving right does seem like a more direct path towards our goal.

However, let's prioritize avoiding being trapped and consider the future moves carefully. For now, moving right seems like the best choice to keep our options open for reaching 'G'.

So, my next move is to (0,2), which is an empty space.

Please update the maze accordingly by moving 'P' from (0,1) to (0,2).

Updated position coordinates:
- (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 P 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,2). To plan the next move, let's examine the adjacent cells:

- Up: Not possible because there's a wall at (0,1) and beyond.
- Down: Possible, as there's an empty space at (1,2).
- Left: Possible, but moving back to (0,1) does not bring us closer to the goal.
- Right: Possible, as there's an empty space at (0,3).

Moving right seems like the best choice to make progress towards 'G'. So, my next move is to (0,3).

Please update the maze accordingly by moving 'P' from (0,2) to (0,3).

Updated position coordinates:
- (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 P 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,3). Let's analyze the adjacent cells:

- Up: Not possible because there's a wall at the top.
- Down: Possible, as there's an empty space at (1,3), but it's blocked by a wall at (1,2) and (1,3) itself has a wall to its right, which limits future moves.
- Left: Possible, but moving back to (0,2) does not bring us closer to the goal.
- Right: Possible, as there's an empty space at (0,4).

Moving right seems like the best choice to continue making progress towards 'G'. So, my next move is to (0,4).

Please update the maze accordingly by moving 'P' from (0,3) to (0,4).

Updated position coordinates:
- (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 P 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,4). Examining the adjacent cells:

- Up: Not possible because there's a wall at the top.
- Down: Possible, as there's an empty space at (1,4), but as before, it's not a favorable direction given the walls below.
- Left: Possible, but moving back to (0,3) does not bring us closer to the goal.
- Right: Possible, as there's an empty space at (0,5).

Continuing to move right seems to be the best option for now, as it keeps me moving towards the general area of 'G'. So, my next move is to (0,5).

Please update the maze accordingly by moving 'P' from (0,4) to (0,5).

Updated position coordinates:
- (0,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 P 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,5). Looking at the adjacent cells:

- Up: Not possible because there's a wall at the top.
- Down: Possible, but as before, moving down to (1,5) doesn't seem to offer a clear path forward due to walls.
- Left: Possible, but moving back to (0,4) does not bring us closer to the goal.
- Right: Possible, as there's an empty space at (0,6).

Moving right again seems to be the best immediate option to continue making progress towards 'G'. So, my next move is to (0,6).

Please update the maze accordingly by moving 'P' from (0,5) to (0,6).

Updated position coordinates:
- (0,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 P
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,6). Since I'm at the rightmost edge of the maze and there are no more moves available to the right, I need to start moving down to get closer to 'G'. Let's examine the adjacent cells:

- Up: Not possible because I'm already at the top.
- Down: Possible, as there's an empty space at (1,6), but since it's not directly below me due to the structure of the maze (I'm at the edge), I need to look one step ahead. Moving down would mean going to (1,6), but what I actually need is to find a way to move down to a position that will eventually allow me to reach 'G'.
- Left: Possible, but moving back doesn't directly get me closer to 'G'.
- Right: Not possible since I'm at the edge.

Since my goal is to move down towards 'G' but the direct path down is blocked by the edge of the maze, I need to backtrack slightly to a column that allows me to move down effectively. Given my aim is to eventually move down, I need to align myself with a path that offers a clearer route to 'G'.

Upon re-evaluation, considering the goal is at (5,5) and my need to move down, I realize that I should move left to align with 'G' vertically. My next move is to (0,5).

Please update the maze accordingly by moving 'P' from (0,6) to (0,5).

Updated position coordinates:
- (0,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 P 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now back at position (0,5). To reach 'G', I need to align myself to move down effectively. Since my goal is to move down towards 'G' at (5,5), and my current position is at the top, I should aim to move down vertically when possible.

However, considering my current position and the structure of the maze, moving directly down from (0,5) would trap me due to the walls below. So, I need to consider a path that will allow me to move down eventually.

Upon examining the maze structure, I see that if I move left to (0,4), I'm still not in a good position to move down. But if I continue moving left, I might find a column that allows a clearer path down.

However, noticing the wall structure, especially seeing that there's a clear path down from (0,3) but it leads to a dead-end, and looking at other paths down, I realize that I actually need to get to the column where 'G' is but from a higher position that allows me to descend without hitting a wall.

Given this analysis, moving left seems like the best preparatory step before finding a suitable column to move down. But I need to plan ahead carefully to choose the correct column to move down. My next move is to (0,4), as I'm considering paths and I don't want to be trapped, but I recognize I need to think more than one step ahead.

However, looking at the larger picture, the correct move involves more strategic planning to reach 'G'. The direct approach might not always be the best. Given the layout and aiming for a path down towards 'G', I reconsider my immediate approach, taking into account the end goal and avoiding potential traps.

Considering the goal is at (5,5), I notice that there is a clear path down through the third column. So, instead, I will plan to align myself with that column and move down from a more favorable position. This requires moving left more than one step.

Therefore, considering the long-term strategy and not just the immediate next step, I decide to move left to start aligning myself for the future moves down. Since I need to move multiple steps left to align with the column that offers a clear path down towards 'G', I adjust my immediate plan.

I move left, but the final goal is to move down towards 'G', indicating a need to eventually get to (0,3) or another suitable column for moving down. Given this, the initial move of going left is part of positioning myself for future moves. The real strategic play involves looking several steps ahead.

For my immediate next move, to keep my options open and plan for future moves down towards 'G', I will move left to (0,4), but the strategic plan involves further movements left to eventually align with the correct column to move down.

Given the strategic analysis, I realize the initial plan to move to (0,4) is just the first part of positioning myself. However, the detailed analysis highlights the need for a careful, multi-step plan to successfully reach 'G'.

My next move, considering the need to set up for future moves down, is indeed left to (0,4), as part of a multi-step strategy to eventually reach the correct column to move down towards 'G'.

Please update the maze accordingly by moving 'P' from (0,5) to (0,4).

Updated position coordinates:

1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,4). Following my previous strategic analysis, I need to move left further to eventually align with the column that allows a clear path down towards 'G'. 

Considering this, my next move is to (0,3), as part of positioning myself for the future moves down.

Please update the maze accordingly by moving 'P' from (0,4) to (0,3).

Updated position coordinates:

1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,3). According to my strategic plan, I should continue to move left to position myself for a clear path down towards 'G'. 

My next move is to (0,2).

Please update the maze accordingly by moving 'P' from (0,3) to (0,2).

Updated position coordinates:

1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,2) but I consider it's better to start moving down from a column closer to the left side, taking into account the structure of the maze and the goal to reach 'G' eventually.

However, given my current position, my immediate next move needs to align with the column where I can move down safely without being blocked by walls. 

Upon reviewing the maze, I notice that the leftmost column that allows a safe passage down, and further down allows movement towards 'G', starts from the position (0,1) but this column itself does not lead directly to 'G'. 

Given this consideration, I will move left to align with a more suitable path down, though it is not directly adjacent to 'G', it's a column that will potentially lead to a future path towards 'G'.

So, my next move is to (0,1).

Please update the maze accordingly by moving 'P' from (0,2) to (0,1).

Updated position coordinates:
- (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,1). From here, I need to start moving down, as the left column allows a safe passage down, though it's not the column directly adjacent to 'G'. 

Considering my position and the goal to reach 'G', moving down is the most logical step to make progress. I will move down to (1,1).

Please update the maze accordingly by moving 'P' from (0,1) to (1,1).

Updated position coordinates:

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the maze is roughly a modified zig-zag or a broken zig-zag path that allows progression from 'P' to 'G'.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7), with empty spaces that form the same general zig-zag shape, but with a different layout:

1 0 P 1 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 0 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note: This new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze but retains the general zig-zag path shape formed by its empty spaces, allowing a valid path from 'P' to 'G'.
