You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 P 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Currently, I am at the position marked 'P', which is surrounded by walls and empty spaces. To move towards the goal 'G', I need to navigate through the empty spaces.

Looking at the maze, a feasible first move would be to move down from 'P' to the adjacent empty space.

My next move will be to the coordinates (4, 5), where I will move down from the current position 'P'.

(Note: In the coordinate system, the first value represents the row number, and the second value represents the column number, both starting from 0.)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Since I'm now at the position marked 'P' at (4, 5), I see that I have limited options for movement due to the surrounding walls. To progress towards the goal 'G', I can try moving left from my current position.

My next move will be to the coordinates (4, 4), where I will move left from the current position 'P'.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "Inverted T" shape, combined with a straight corridor that leads to the goal.

However, a more overall view of the shape could be seen as a downward spiral, beginning with the leftmost empty space and traversing clockwise and then moving towards the bottom right corner of the maze where the goal 'G' is located.

(2) Here is a new maze that satisfies the conditions:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 P 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) resembles an "Inverted T" combined with a straight down shape towards the goal 'G', overall with a downward spiral trajectory from top left to bottom right where the goal is located.
