You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I see that the current player position (P) is at coordinates (0,3). My objective is to move to an adjacent empty space. I have two options for my next move, which are moving up to coordinates (0,2) or moving down to coordinates (0,4). However, since the goal position (G) is below the current position, I prefer moving down to coordinates (0,4) to be closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are (0,4).

Please update the maze with my new position and let me know the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again. Since I am now at coordinates (0,4), my next move should aim to move closer to the goal (G) while avoiding walls. 

I see that the space to the right of my current position is empty, and there's a wall below it, but moving right will give me a better view of the maze. However, I can also move down to coordinates (1,4), but since there is a wall to the right of that position and I will still be far from the goal (G), I don't consider it the best option. The best option seems to be moving right to coordinates (0,5), but this won't lead me towards the goal directly. A closer inspection shows that moving right and then going downwards can be helpful but I should first try and move down to be closer to the goal.


After rechecking the maze I see I can go down then left.

The coordinates of my next move are (1,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "**zig-zag or winding path**".

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:


1 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and features a zig-zag or winding path shape formed by its empty spaces.
