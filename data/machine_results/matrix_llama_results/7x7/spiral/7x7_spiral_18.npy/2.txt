You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by moving the player to the right. 

The player's current position is at (0,3), and I will move to (0,4), which is an empty space. 

My next move is to (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will move the player to the right again. 

The player's current position is at (0,4), and I will move to (0,5), which is an empty space.

My next move is to (0,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've reached the right edge of the empty space on the top row, I will move the player down to the next row. 

The player's current position is at (0,5), and I will move to (1,5), which is an empty space.

My next move is to (1,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 P 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will move the player down to the next row, as I'm trying to get closer to the goal.

The player's current position is at (1,5), and I will move to (2,5), but I see that's a wall. Instead, I will move to an empty space on the left.

However, looking at the maze, a more suitable move would be to go left and then try to go down. 

My next move is to (1,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or an "L-path."

Here is a new maze with the same size and a valid path from P to G, forming the same L-shape:


1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the player starts at the top row, and the goal is located in the fourth row. The path from P to G follows an L-shape, with the corner of the L located at (2,3). This maze meets the criteria of having a valid path, not being an identical copy of the original, and maintaining the same L-shape.
