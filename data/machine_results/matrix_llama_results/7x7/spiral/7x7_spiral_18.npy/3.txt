You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I see that the current player position (P) is at coordinates (0,3). My objective is to move to an adjacent empty space. I have two options for my next move, which are moving up to coordinates (0,2) or moving right to coordinates (0,4). However, moving right would lead to a dead end, so I prefer to keep more possibilities open.

My next move will be to coordinates (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at coordinates (0,2), I can see that my next possible moves are moving down to coordinates (1,2) or moving left to coordinates (0,1). Since my goal is to get to the goal position (G), which is located below my current position, I prefer to move down to make progress towards the goal.

My next move will be to coordinates (1,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "zigzag" or "serpentine" path.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:


1 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1


In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a zigzag path from P to G, but the arrangement of walls and empty spaces is different from the original maze.
