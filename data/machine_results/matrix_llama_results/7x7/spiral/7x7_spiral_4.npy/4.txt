You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 1 0 1 1
P 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move. 

From the current player position 'P', I am at (5,0). The goal position 'G' is at (2,0). 

Looking at the adjacent spaces, I can move either up, down, left, or right. Since my objective is to reach the goal position, I'll prioritize moving up towards the goal. 

However, I need to move to an empty space. Moving directly up to (4,0) is not possible because it's an empty space but moving up to (4,0) would put me in a position where I would be stuck, as the only adjacent empty space would be back to the starting position.

A more promising move would be to move right to (5,1), as there are more possibilities to move up and get closer to the goal from there.

So, my next move will be to the coordinates (5,1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "elongated zigzag".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form an elongated zigzag shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
G 0 1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 0 1
0 0 1 0 1 1 1
P 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original (7x7) and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. It is not an identical copy of the original maze, and the empty spaces form an elongated zigzag shape, which is recognizable as the same general shape as the original maze.
