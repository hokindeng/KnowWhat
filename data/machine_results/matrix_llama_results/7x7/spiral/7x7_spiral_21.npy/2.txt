You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

G 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move. 

Currently, I'm at position P (4,0), and my goal is to reach G (0,0). Since I can only move up, down, left, or right, I'll look for the nearest empty space.

I'll move up to (3,0) since it's the only available empty space adjacent to my current position.

Next move: (3,0)

Please update the maze with my new position and let me know the new state of the maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

G 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

Since I'm now at position P (3,0) and my goal is to reach G (0,0), I'll look for a path to move upwards.

However, the space directly above me is a wall (0 1 1 1 0 1 1). So, I'll move to the right is not possible due to the wall and moving down would take me away from the goal, thus, I'll look for an opportunity to move up while avoiding the wall.

There is an empty space at (3,1) behind the wall but that is also not an option because it doesn't lead to the goal.

I can move right three spaces to (3,4) then I will be able to go up.

But for now I will move to the right to position (3,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "**Z-shape**" or a "**Staircase**". The path from P to G resembles a zigzag or staircase-like pattern.

Here's a new maze with the same size, forming a similar Z-shape or Staircase pattern:


G 1 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the path from P to G forms a similar Z-shape or Staircase pattern, while the walls and obstacles are arranged differently to create a new challenge.
