You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (2,3). The adjacent empty spaces that I can move to are up, left, or right. Since the goal 'G' is located at a lower row, I will move down.

However, there is a wall directly below me. Therefore, I will move to the right, as moving up will lead me away from the goal, and moving left might complicate the path.

So, my next move will be to the right, from (2,3) to (2,4).

My next move coordinates are: (2,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (2,4). The adjacent empty spaces that I can move to are up, left, or down is not an option due to the wall. Since the goal 'G' is located at a lower row, I will try to move down but in a way that allows me to bypass the wall. To do so, I can move left and try to find a path to go down later.

So, my next move will be to the left, from (2,4) to (2,3).

My next move coordinates are: (2,3).

I am currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (2,3). The adjacent empty spaces that I can move to are up, left, or right. Since moving up will not bring me closer to the goal 'G', I will try to move down but in a way that allows me to bypass the wall. I notice that there is a wall to the right, but the left path seems promising.

So, my next move will be to the left, from (2,3) to (2,2).

My next move coordinates are: (2,2).

I am currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (2,2). The adjacent empty spaces that I can move to are up, left, right, or down is not an immediate option due to the wall. I notice that moving left might allow me to find a path to go down later. However, I also notice that moving left will put me in a narrow corridor. Therefore, I will move left carefully.

So, my next move will be to the left, from (2,2) to (2,1).

My next move coordinates are: (2,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (2,1). The adjacent empty spaces that I can move to are up or right. Since moving up will not bring me closer to the goal 'G' and moving right will only lead me back to the previous position, I will try to move down but in a way that allows me to bypass the wall.

I notice that moving down directly is not an option due to the wall. However, if I move right and then try to find a path, I might be able to go down later. But since that was the original position and didn't offer an easy path down, I will consider the left path now and in subsequent turns (starting from (2,0) and the subsequent row if allowed). I notice that (2,0) is not blocked, so it is likely a pathway down toward G.

So, my next move will be to the left, from (2,1) to (2,0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (2,0). The adjacent empty space that I can move to is down. Since moving down will bring me closer to the goal 'G', I will try to move down.

So, my next move will be to move down, from (2,0) to (3,0).

However, I note that at position (3,0) I will encounter the row where 'G' is, and the row below is also promising for movement left, so I am potentially two moves away from G.

My next move coordinates are: (3,0), but this is likely not G's column, but as soon as two or three moves after that I should reach G.



Let's see!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

P 1 1 1 0 1 1

0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (3,0). The adjacent empty spaces that I can move to are down or right (after four spaces, that is). However, I notice that I can also move left but only if I am on the row below.

Since moving down directly to 'G' at (4,0) would require me being in (3,0), and that isn't the column with G. I will first try to move left on this row, but that would fail, so I have to move down to the row where G is.

My next move will be to move down, from (3,0) to (4,0.



Now the next steps are clear!



My next move coordinates are: (4,0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "C-Shaped" or " hooks" with a possible wider understanding as "Single subscribes rectangle or to some people staircase" although further is interpretation is vigil.



Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:



1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1



This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is also recognizable as a C-Shape (it can have partial hooks faces southern or other directions due arises termed reasonably.
