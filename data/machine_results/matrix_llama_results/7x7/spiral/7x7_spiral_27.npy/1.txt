You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by moving the player to the right. 

The player's current position is (2, 3), and I will move to (2, 4), which is an empty space.

My next move is to coordinates (2, 4).

Please update the maze accordingly, and I will plan my next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will move the player down to the next empty space. The player's current position is (2, 4), and I will move to (3, 4), which is an empty space below.

My next move is to coordinates (3, 4).

Please update the maze accordingly, and I will plan my next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 P 1 1
G 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now, I will move the player down again to get closer to the goal. The player's current position is (3, 4), and I will move to (4, 4), which is an empty space below.

My next move is to coordinates (4, 4).

However, I notice that there's a wall to the left of the goal. I might need to plan a detour or re-route my path to reach the goal.

Please update the maze accordingly, and I will plan my next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 0 P 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will move the player to the left to get around the wall and get closer to the goal. The player's current position is (4, 4), and I will move to (4, 3), which is an empty space to the left.

My next move is to coordinates (4, 3).

I'll continue to navigate around the wall to find a path to the goal.

Please update the maze accordingly, and I will plan my next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 P 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will move the player to the left again to continue navigating around the wall. The player's current position is (4, 3), and I will move to (4, 2), which is an empty space to the left.

My next move is to coordinates (4, 2).

I'm getting closer to the goal, and I'll keep finding a way to reach it.

Please update the maze accordingly, and I will plan my next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 P 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm next to the goal, I'll move to the goal position. The player's current position is (4, 2), and I will move to (4, 1), which is the goal (G) to the left.

However, I don't want to push the goal, I want to move into the goal's position. Therefore my next move is to coordinates (4, 1) which should now be my new position 'P' overwriting 'G'.

Please update the maze accordingly.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L-shape" or an "L-path"

The L-shape is characterized by a long horizontal or vertical corridor that turns at a right angle (90 degrees) to form another corridor.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-shape.
