You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at 'P', which is located at (2,3) since the top left corner is (0,0).

From the current position 'P', I can see that there are empty spaces ('0') above, to the left, and to the right. To get closer to the goal 'G', I will move to the left.

My next move is to (2,2).

Please update the maze to reflect this new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position 'P' at (2,2), I can see that there are empty spaces above and to the left. I can also see that the goal 'G' is below, but there's a wall in the way.

To get closer to the goal, I'll continue moving to the left and explore other possible paths.

My next move is to (2,1).

Please update the maze to reflect this new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position 'P' at (2,1), I can see that there's an empty space above, which could lead to a new path.

My next move is to (1,1).

Please update the maze to reflect this new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I can see that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is an "S-shape" or a sinuous shape, which connects the player's starting position 'P' to the goal position 'G'.

Here is a new maze with empty spaces that form an S-shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 P 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1

This maze is a new instance with the same S-shape formed by the empty spaces, and it provides a valid path from 'P' to 'G'. Note that the maze has the same size as the original and is not an identical copy.
