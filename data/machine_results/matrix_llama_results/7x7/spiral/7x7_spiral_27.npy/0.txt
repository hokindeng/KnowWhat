You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (2,3). To find the shortest path, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy to avoid getting stuck in an infinite loop or taking unnecessary steps.

After examining the adjacent positions, I can move either up, down, left, or right. However, moving up would put me into the wall (1), and moving left or right is feasible but moving down seems like the best option because it puts me closer to the goal position 'G'.

I will move down to the position with coordinates (3,3).

Please provide the updated maze after my move. 

My next move coordinates: (3,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a zigzag.

(2) Here is a new maze with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 0 1
G 1 1 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 1 1 1

Note that the new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but the general shape formed by the empty spaces remains recognizable as a zigzag.
