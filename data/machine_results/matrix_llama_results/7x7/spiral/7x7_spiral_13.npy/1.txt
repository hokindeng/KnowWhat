You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Currently, I am at position 'P', which is at coordinates (6, 3). To navigate to the goal 'G', I need to move upwards and to the left. There is a wall directly above my position, so I will need to navigate around it.

My next move will be to move one step to the right, to the empty space adjacent to my current position.

The coordinates of my next move are (6, 4).

Please let me know the updated maze, and I will plan my next move accordingly.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I can conclude that:

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces is an "L-shape" or a " corner shape". However, upon closer inspection, I notice that there are also some narrow corridors connecting the L-shape, so I'll refine my answer to a "serpentine L-shape" or an "L-shape with a winding tunnel".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size, having a path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and forming the same serpentine L-shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 0
1 G 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 P 0 1 1 1

Note that this maze meets all the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original, and exhibits a similar serpentine L-shape in its corridors.
