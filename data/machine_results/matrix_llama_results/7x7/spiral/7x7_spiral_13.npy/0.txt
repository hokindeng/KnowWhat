You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To start solving the maze, I'll identify the current position of the player 'P', which is at coordinates (6, 2) in the maze. Since I can move up, down, left, or right to an empty space, I will examine all these options.

Moving up from (6, 2) is not possible because there's a wall directly above 'P'. Moving down from (6, 2) to (7, 2) is not advisable because it does not immediately bring me closer to the goal 'G' and the path down is blocked by a wall further down. Moving right from (6, 2) to (6, 3) is possible because it's an empty space, and this move starts heading in the general direction towards 'G' without immediately hitting a wall. Moving left from (6, 2) is blocked by a wall.

Therefore, my next move will be to the right, to the coordinates (6, 3).

Next move coordinates: (6, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move from the current position of 'P', which is now at coordinates (6, 3).

From (6, 3), moving up is blocked by a wall, and moving down doesn't immediately bring me closer to 'G' and faces a blockage further down. Moving right to (6, 4) is possible because it's an empty space, continuing the path towards 'G'. Moving left to (6, 2) is also possible since it's an empty space, but it goes away from the direction towards 'G'.

Given these options, my next move will be to the right again, to the coordinates (6, 4), as it continues the path towards the goal 'G'.

Next move coordinates: (6, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position of 'P' at coordinates (6, 4), I'll examine the possible moves.

Moving up from (6, 4) is blocked by walls. Moving down doesn't bring me closer to 'G' immediately and faces a blockage. Moving right to (6, 5) is possible as it's an empty space, but it doesn't seem to lead directly to 'G'. Moving left to (6, 3) is possible, returning to the previous position, but it doesn't progress towards 'G'.

However, since my goal is to move towards 'G', and considering the structure of the maze, moving up is not possible directly due to the walls. I notice that moving left and then possibly up could be a strategy to reach 'G'.

Considering this, a more strategic move is needed to eventually reach 'G'. Since moving directly towards 'G' is blocked by walls, I'll need to find an alternative route. Given the current options, moving left doesn't help immediately, but it is part of a strategy to potentially go up. Since the direct right path doesn't immediately help reach 'G', and moving down is less optimal, I reconsider the path to see if going up is possible through another route.

However, going back to my immediate options from (6, 4), to maintain progress towards finding a route up and considering the constraints, moving right to explore the path and ensure no immediate options are overlooked before backtracking to find an upwards path seems a reasonable step.

Therefore, my next move will be to the right, to the coordinates (6, 5), to ensure no immediate options towards 'G' are missed before revisiting and possibly backtracking to find an alternative upwards route.

Next move coordinates: (6, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position of 'P' at coordinates (6, 5), I'll examine the possible moves.

Given the updated maze and considering the moves from (6, 5), moving up is still blocked by walls. Moving down doesn't bring me closer to 'G' and leads to a blockage. Moving right to (6, 6) is possible as it's an empty space but doesn't lead directly to 'G'. Moving left to (6, 4) returns to the previous position.

Considering the strategic objective to reach 'G' and given the structure of the maze, I recognize the need to backtrack and find a path that allows me to move up towards 'G'. Since direct upwards movement from the current position is blocked by walls, I must revisit my path.

From the current position at (6, 5), a strategic decision to backtrack and explore potential upwards paths from previous positions is necessary. Given this, my next move will actually be to backtrack to the left, to the coordinates (6, 4), with the intention of exploring upwards options or further revising my path towards 'G'.

Next move coordinates: (6, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Back to this position. From the current position of 'P' at coordinates (6, 4), I'll reconsider my options with the strategic goal of finding a path upwards towards 'G'.

Moving right would bring me back to the previous position, which doesn't lead directly to 'G'. Moving down doesn't bring me closer to 'G' and faces a blockage. Moving up is still blocked by walls.

However, considering the maze structure and the need to find a path that allows me to move up towards 'G', I must explore moving left and then possibly up. Since moving left to (6, 3) is possible, this could be part of a path that eventually leads up towards 'G'.

Therefore, my next move will be to the left, to the coordinates (6, 3), with the intention of exploring upwards options or further revising my path towards 'G'.

Next move coordinates: (6, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position of 'P' at coordinates (6, 3), I'll examine my options again.

Considering the strategic goal to reach 'G', moving right doesn't immediately help as it was previously explored. Moving down doesn't bring me closer to 'G' and faces a blockage. Moving up is still blocked by walls.

However, since my last move was to the left, I continue with this strategy, exploring if moving further left could help in finding an upwards path. Moving left to (6, 2) could potentially bring me closer to an upwards path or reveal more options.

Therefore, my next move will be to the left, to the coordinates (6, 2), with the intention of finding an upwards path or further exploring options towards 'G'.

Next move coordinates: (6, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position of 'P' at coordinates (6, 2), I'll examine my options again.

Since moving right was already explored, and moving down doesn't bring me closer to 'G' and faces a blockage, I'll focus on moving up or further left. 

Moving up from (6, 2) is still blocked by walls, but I notice that moving left to (6, 1) could potentially bring me closer to an upwards path that could be viable.

Therefore, my next move will be to the left, to the coordinates (6, 1), with the intention of finding an upwards path or further exploring options towards 'G'.

Next move coordinates: (6, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position of 'P' at coordinates (6, 1), I'll examine my options.

Moving down doesn't bring me closer to 'G' and leads to previously explored paths. Moving right also doesn't help as it goes back to previously explored positions. 

However, now that I'm at (6, 1), I can attempt to move up. Moving up from (6, 1) to (5, 1) could bring me closer to an eventual path towards 'G'.

Therefore, my next move will be up, to the coordinates (5, 1), with the intention of finding a path towards 'G'.

Next move coordinates: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position of 'P' at coordinates (5, 1), I'll examine my options.

Moving down doesn't bring me closer to 'G' and goes back to a previously explored position. Moving right is blocked by a wall.

However, now that I'm at (5, 1), I notice that moving up could bring me closer to an eventual path towards 'G'. Moving up from (5, 1) to (4, 1) seems viable as it's an empty space and could lead towards the goal.

Therefore, my next move will be up, to the coordinates (4, 1), with the intention of finding a path towards 'G'.

Next move coordinates: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 P 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position of 'P' at coordinates (4, 1), I'll examine my options.

Moving right is blocked by a wall, and moving down doesn't bring me closer to 'G' and goes back to a previously explored position.

However, I notice that moving up is a possibility. Moving up from (4, 1) to (3, 1) seems viable as it's adjacent to the goal 'G'. This could be a crucial move in finding a path towards 'G'.

Therefore, my next move will be up, to the coordinates (3, 1), with the intention of finding a path towards 'G'.

Next move coordinates: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now right next to the goal 'G'.

From the current position of 'P' at coordinates (3, 1), I can move up to (2, 1), but that doesn't seem necessary. I can also try to move right, but it's blocked by a wall.

However, I notice that I can move left to (3, 0) and then potentially up to reach the goal 'G' at (2, 2) via (2, 1) and then right, or there could be an alternative path from (3, 0). But the most direct approach would be to move up from my current position and then left to the goal.

Since moving directly up from my current position to the goal is blocked by a wall on the right-hand side, I should try moving left to (3, 0), then up, then right. However since I am trying to provide the very next move only rather than find the full path I should just provide the left move.

Therefore, my next move will be left, to the coordinates (3, 0), with the intention of getting into position to reach the goal 'G' in a subsequent move.

Next move coordinates: (3, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag or winding path with two turns, roughly resembling an 'L' shape with an additional horizontal segment connected at its top end".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1 1 1


This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and its empty spaces form a similar zig-zag or winding path shape. Note that the exact path is different, but the overall shape is recognizable as similar.
