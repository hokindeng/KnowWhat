You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by identifying the current player position (P) and the goal position (G). The current player position is at (6,2), and the goal position is at (2,1).

To plan my next move, I will examine the adjacent squares to the current player position. Since I can move up, down, left, or right, I will check these directions for empty spaces. 

Moving up from (6,2) would lead to a wall (1), which is not a valid move.
Moving down from (6,2) would lead to an empty space (0) at (6,3).
Moving left from (6,2) would lead to a wall (1), which is not a valid move.
Moving right from (6,2) would lead to an empty space (0) at (6,3), but since the down move already offers this option, I'll prioritize moving down to maintain consistency in my decision-making.

Therefore, my next move would be down, to the coordinates (6,3), which will put me at the new position:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0 0 0

However, since you requested the coordinates of my next move in the context of the original maze, my response should be based on the maze before updating it with my new position. Therefore, considering the original maze provided:

The coordinates of my next move would be (6,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will re-evaluate the adjacent squares to the current player position (P) at (6,3).

Moving up from (6,3) would lead to an empty space (0) at (6,2).
Moving down from (6,3) is not possible since it's already at the bottom of the maze.
Moving left from (6,3) would lead to an empty space (0) at (6,2), which is already covered by the up move.
Moving right from (6,3) would lead to an empty space (0) at (6,4).

Since moving up would put me back to the previous position, I'll prioritize moving right to explore a new area. 

The coordinates of my next move would be (6,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will re-evaluate the adjacent squares to the current player position (P) at (6,4).

Moving up from (6,4) would lead to a wall (1) at (5,4).
Moving down from (6,4) is not possible since it's already at the bottom of the maze.
Moving left from (6,4) would lead to an empty space (0) at (6,3).
Moving right from (6,4) would lead to an empty space (0) at (6,5).

Since moving left would put me back to the previous position, I'll prioritize moving right to explore a new area.

The coordinates of my next move would be (6,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will re-evaluate the adjacent squares to the current player position (P) at (6,5).

Moving up from (6,5) would lead to a wall (1) at (5,5).
Moving down from (6,5) is not possible since it's already at the bottom of the maze.
Moving left from (6,5) would lead to an empty space (0) at (6,4), which is already visited.
Moving right from (6,5) would lead to an empty space (0) at (6,6).

Since moving right would allow me to continue exploring the maze, I'll prioritize this move.

The coordinates of my next move would be (6,6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will re-evaluate the adjacent squares to the current player position (P) at (6,6).

Since I'm at the rightmost position of the maze, moving right is not possible.

Moving up from (6,6) would not lead to a meaningful path, as the adjacent cell is a wall (1) or a part of the path already explored.
Moving down from (6,6) is not possible since it's already at the bottom of the maze.
Moving left from (6,6) would lead to an empty space (0) at (6,5).

Considering the available options, I will move left to explore the possibility of finding a path to the goal.

However, upon reviewing the maze again, I realize that this approach might lead me back to previously visited areas. To make progress, I should focus on finding an alternative path.

Let's re-examine the maze: moving left would indeed lead me to a familiar area. I should aim to backtrack and explore other branches. Notably, there's an unexplored branch around the starting area (near the top).

I need to move up to reach that unexplored branch. I can see an available path for backtracking: moving left, then up.

By analyzing this situation, my best next move is to start backtracking by moving left.

The coordinates of my next move would be (6,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've successfully backtracked to (6,5). Now, I will continue to backtrack to explore the alternative path I mentioned earlier.

From (6,5), I can move left to (6,4), and continue left to (6,3), then (6,2). Upon reaching (6,2), I can move up to explore the new path.

However, since I need to specify the immediate next move, I will focus on moving left.

The coordinates of my next move would be (6,4).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've successfully moved to (6,4). To continue backtracking and exploring the alternative path, I will move left again.

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've successfully moved to (6,2). To continue backtracking and exploring the alternative path, I will move up.

The coordinates of my next move would be (5,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a " serpentine shape" or a winding path that turns and curves through the maze.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar serpentine shape:
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
```
This maze meets the criteria, with a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a serpentine shape.
