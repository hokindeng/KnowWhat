You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am starting at the position 'P' which is located at the coordinates (5,4) in the given 2D grid. 

My goal is to move towards the goal 'G' which is at coordinates (0,4). 

The path that seems most promising from my current position would be to move up to reduce the distance between me and the goal.

However, moving directly up would put me into a wall (located at (4,4)). So, my next best move would be to move to the left or the right to an empty space and then move up. Given that the right path is shorter and has fewer turns, my next move will be to the right (increasing the y-coordinate).

Therefore, my next move would be from (5,4) to (5,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my new position at (5,5), my next objective is to move up and get closer to the goal. 

Since the position directly above me is empty (located at (4,5)), I can move up. 

Therefore, my next move would be from (5,5) to (4,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 P 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved up to (4,5). 

Now, I'll analyze the new situation: 

To my left, there's a wall (at (4,4)). 

To my right, there's a wall (at (4,6)). 

Above me, there's another wall (at (3,5)). 

However, if I move up and to the left (in a subsequent move), I might find a path. 

But for now, since the above is blocked, I'll move to the left and up in the next two moves, I'll move left now. 

Therefore, my next move would be from (4,5) to (4,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) a zig-zag or a winding stair-like shape.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

0 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces (corridors) still form a winding stair-like shape, but the path from P to G is different and the maze is not an identical copy of the original.
