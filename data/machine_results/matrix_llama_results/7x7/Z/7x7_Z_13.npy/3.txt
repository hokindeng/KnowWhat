You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position 'P'. It seems the only direction to move is through the empty spaces to the left or possibly down. Since the goal 'G' seems to be located below the current position, moving down might bring us closer to the goal. However, since we can only see the immediate surroundings, the safest initial move would be to move to an empty space that is adjacent to 'P'. The coordinates of 'P' are (2,5), considering the top left corner as (0,0).

Given this, my next move would be to the empty space directly to the left of 'P', at coordinates (2,4). This move is chosen because it moves into an empty space, avoiding walls and keeping options open for future moves. 

So, my next move is to (2,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After analyzing the updated maze, I see that I am now at position (2,4). I notice that I still have empty spaces to the left and possibly down. Considering my goal is to reach 'G', which appears to be below my current position, I'll prioritize moving down to create opportunities to get closer to 'G'. However, the direct path down from my current position is blocked by a wall. 

Given this situation, my next move will be to the left, aiming to find a path that could lead me down towards 'G' or at least keep my options open. So, I will move to the empty space at coordinates (2,3).

My next move is to (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2,3), I again evaluate my surroundings. The path to the right would bring me back to the starting point, which is not optimal. Moving up is blocked by walls. Since I aim to reach 'G', which is below me, and the path directly down is still blocked by walls, I need to find a way to navigate around these obstacles.

Considering the structure of the maze, it seems that moving further to the left might help in finding a path down. However, there's a limit to how far left I can go before hitting the wall, and then I would need to find a way down. Given the current view, my best option is to continue moving left to explore possibilities for moving down.

My next move is to (2,2).

(If this move reveals no immediate path down, future moves might involve going up if possible to explore other routes or moving back to the right if necessary.)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now at position (2,2), I've reached the furthest left point without finding a clear path down. My next step is crucial to finding a way to 'G'. Since moving up is not an option due to walls, and moving further left is also not possible, I must look at moving either right or down for potential paths.

Given the structure of the maze and my goal to reach 'G', moving down is my priority. However, the path directly down from my current position is blocked by a wall. I notice, though, that there's an empty space diagonally down to the right from my position, which could potentially offer a path towards 'G'.

Considering diagonal moves are allowed, my next move will be diagonally down to the right, aiming to bypass the wall and make progress towards 'G'. The coordinates for this diagonal move would be (3,3).

My next move is to (3,3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as roughly forming an "inverted L" or a "reversed L" shape. However, considering the turn at the bottom leading to 'G', it could also be interpreted more broadly as a "path with an L-shaped turn" or a simplified maze path with a distinctive corner or bend. But focusing on the geometric aspect, we can approximate the path's overall structure to be akin to an inverted L-shape.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size, where the empty spaces form roughly the same inverted L-shape, providing a valid path from 'P' to 'G':

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, 'P' and 'G' are placed to ensure a path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces, and the overall path structure maintains a rough resemblance to an inverted L-shape, adhering to the required criteria.
