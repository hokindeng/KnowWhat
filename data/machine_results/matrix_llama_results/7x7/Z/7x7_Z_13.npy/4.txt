You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. I am currently at position 'P' which seems to be at coordinates (2, 5). To move closer to the goal 'G' at (4, 2), considering I can move in any of the eight directions to an adjacent empty space, I need to move diagonally down-left to the empty space at (3, 4).

Therefore, my next move will be to the coordinates (3, 4).

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, I am now at position (3, 4). To continue moving closer to the goal 'G' at (4, 2), I'll consider the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position. The most direct path towards 'G' from my current position (3, 4) involves moving diagonally down-left to (4, 3), but since that's not an empty space, I'll have to choose an alternative. The best next step, considering the constraints, is to move left to (3, 3) to create an opportunity to get closer to 'G' in subsequent moves.

However, since (3, 3) is not an empty space, my best available move is actually to move up-left to (2, 3). 

Therefore, my next move will be to the coordinates (2, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, I am now at position (2, 3). To move closer to the goal 'G' at (4, 2), I'll assess the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position. A direct path to 'G' is not available, so I will move down to (3, 3) to create an opportunity to move closer to 'G' in subsequent moves.



Therefore, my next move will be to the coordinates (3, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag" or a " serpentine" shape.



Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zig-zag shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a zig-zag shape, but it's not an identical copy of the original maze.
