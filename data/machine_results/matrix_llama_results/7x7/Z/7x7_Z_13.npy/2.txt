You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position 'P'. It seems the only direction to move is through the empty spaces to the left or possibly down. Since the goal 'G' seems to be located below the current position, moving down might bring us closer to the goal. However, since we can only see the immediate surroundings, the safest initial move would be to the left to ensure we have space to maneuver.

Given the position of 'P', which is at coordinates (2,5) based on the maze layout you've provided (assuming the top left corner is (0,0) and we start counting from 0), the coordinates for the next move to the left would be (2,4).

Therefore, my next move would be to (2,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, I see that moving down is still the direction towards the goal 'G'. However, since moving directly down from my current position (2,4) is blocked by a wall (1), I should move further left to find a path down.

Since I'm at coordinates (2,4) now and there's an empty space to the left, my next move would be to (2,3).

Therefore, my next move would be to (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'm now at coordinates (2,3). Since moving directly down from here is still blocked by a wall (1), I need to move down where it's possible. Given the structure of the maze, moving further left doesn't seem to provide an immediate advantage because I would still need to navigate downwards.

However, noticing the structure below my current position, it seems there's an empty space at (5,3) that could be part of a path leading towards 'G'. To reach this, I need to move down from my current position. But since I cannot move directly down from (2,3) due to the wall, I need to move right first to a position from which I can move down.

Given the need to eventually move down, my immediate move to prepare for this would be to move right, to the position (2,4), if it were not for the fact that moving right was my previous position which doesn't help in making progress towards the goal. Given this, I should actually attempt a diagonal move down and right if the game allows for it, aiming for (3,4).

If diagonal moves are not allowed despite your initial mention of them, then my only viable move to make progress towards the goal would be to slide one step to the right and then assess if a path downwards is available.

However, re-reading the instructions, it seems diagonal moves are permissible. Thus, my next move would be diagonally down and to the right to (3,4), if allowed.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3,4), the goal 'G' is within closer reach, but I still cannot move directly to it because of the wall (1) between us. Given the updated maze, it's clear that I need to navigate around the wall that is blocking my access to 'G'.

The wall above 'G' extends to the left and right, meaning I have to go around it either from the left or the right side. Considering my current position and the distribution of empty spaces (0) around me, a viable strategy seems to be moving to the left to create an opportunity to move downwards.

Since moving directly to 'G' is blocked, I should move left to position (3,3), aiming to eventually move down when possible.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3,3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as roughly resembling a "rectangular or square U-shape" or more broadly, a shape that includes a square or rectangular section connected by a corridor or a tunnel.

2. Below is a new maze that has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G', and is not an identical copy of the original. The corridors or empty spaces in this maze also form a shape that resembles a square or rectangular U-shape, similar to the original.

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 P 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze, the path from 'P' to 'G' is also found within corridors that form a rectangular U-shape, albeit oriented differently and not as wide as in the original.
