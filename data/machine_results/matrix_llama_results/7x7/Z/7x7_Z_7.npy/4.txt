You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I see that the current player position (P) is at coordinates (3, 3) if we consider (0, 0) as the top-left corner. To reach the goal position (G), I need to move down and left. Since I can move diagonally, I will try to get closer to the goal in as few steps as possible while avoiding the walls. 

For my next move, I will move down to the empty space at coordinates (3, 4), which is directly below my current position.

My next move coordinates are: (3, 4)

Please update the maze with my new position and let me know if I'm correct or not.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I can see that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is an "Inverted Z" or a roughly diagonal line with a turn.

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is an "Inverted Z".

To create a new maze with the same shape, I will generate a new set of walls, empty spaces, and positions for P and G.

Here is a new maze with the same size as the original:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an "Inverted Z" shape, with P and G positioned to allow for a path through the corridors. Note that this maze is not identical to the original but maintains the same overall shape formed by the empty spaces.
