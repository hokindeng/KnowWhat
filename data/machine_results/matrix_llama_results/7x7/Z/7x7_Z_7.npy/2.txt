You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. I am currently at position P, which is located at (2,4) if we consider the top-left corner as (0,0). My goal is to reach G, which is at (4,2).

For my first move, I will move down to the empty space at (3,4). However, since I need to provide the next move as coordinates and considering the instructions allow for movements in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and any diagonal), and I need to give a precise next step, I notice that moving directly down to (3,4) is blocked by a wall.

A viable move is to go left to (2,3), which is an empty space. Considering coordinates, moving left decreases the y-coordinate, so from (2,4), moving left takes me to (2,3).

The coordinates of my next move are (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, I am now at position (2,3), marked as P. The goal remains at position (4,2), marked as G.

My objective is to move closer to G while avoiding walls and moving through empty spaces. Since I can move in any of the eight directions, I will move left to the empty space at (2,2).

The coordinates of my next move are (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I am now at position (2,2), marked as P. I will aim to get closer to the goal, G, at (4,2).

Since I am now at (2,2) and my goal is directly below me at a diagonal, however, I am blocked by walls below and to the right. My viable next move is to go left to the empty space at (2,1).

The coordinates of my next move are (2,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, I am now at position (2,1), marked as P. To get closer to G at (4,2), I need to move downwards.

However, I am blocked by a wall at (3,1). A viable move is to go right to (2,2), but this will put me back at the previous position, which is not ideal. Instead, I can try moving down diagonally to the right, which takes me to (3,2). This position is not blocked by a wall and moves me closer to G.

The coordinates of my next move are (3,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L" shape or a hook-like shape, with an extension at the bottom and a small branch on the left side.

Here's a new maze with the same size and a valid path from P to G, with empty spaces forming a similar "L" shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 P 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and forms an "L" shape with its empty spaces.
