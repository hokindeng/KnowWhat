You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. I am currently at the position marked 'P', which seems to be at coordinates (3, 4) of the maze. My goal is to reach the position marked 'G', which is at coordinates (4, 2) of the maze.

Looking at the maze, a good initial move would be to move to the empty space directly to the left of my current position, which would put me at coordinates (3, 3). This move avoids walls and brings me slightly closer to the goal position, keeping in mind that I can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in future steps.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I am now at position (3, 3). To continue navigating towards the goal, I will move up to the empty space directly above me. This move will put me at coordinates (2, 3).

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I am now at position (2, 3). My next move will be to move to the left to the adjacent empty space. This will put me at coordinates (2, 2).

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I am now at position (2, 2). My goal is still to reach the position marked 'G' at coordinates (4, 2). Since I am at the same x-coordinate as the goal, my best move would be to move down towards the goal.

I will move down to the empty space that is closest to the goal. However, since there is a wall directly below me, I will move diagonally down and to the right to coordinates (3, 3) and then reassess my position.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems I've returned to a familiar position. Since I was here before, I know that my next best move would be to move down to get closer to the goal, but the wall directly below me prevents that.

Given my current position (3, 3), my next move will be to move down and to the left, diagonally, to coordinates (4, 2), which is actually the goal position marked 'G'. If this move is valid, I should reach the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (4, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or "L-corridor."

Here is a new maze that meets the specified criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is also recognizable as an "L-shape" or "L-corridor."
