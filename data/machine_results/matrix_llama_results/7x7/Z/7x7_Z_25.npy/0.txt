You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 G 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To solve the maze, I will apply a greedy algorithm with a heuristic that guides me towards the goal 'G'.

My current position is 'P' at coordinates (6, 5). The goal 'G' is at coordinates (0, 3). I'll try to move in the direction that minimizes the distance to the goal.

To simplify, I'll aim to reduce the larger of the horizontal or vertical distances to the goal with each move. Currently, the vertical distance (difference in y-coordinates) is larger, so I'll prioritize moving up.

My next move will be to the position directly above my current position, provided it's an empty space.

The coordinates of my next move are (5, 5).

(Next move will be based on the updated maze, which should reflect the new position after this move.)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze appears to be a combination of corridors that together resemble a diagonal staircase or an "L" shape from a top-down perspective, curved or angled around walls, leading from the starting point 'P' to the goal 'G'. However, simplifying the shape for clarity, we could say it has elements of a diagonal path.

(2) Given the description and the need to replicate a similar path in a new maze while ensuring it's not an identical copy, I've created a new maze. This maze maintains a diagonal-like path but with variations in the corridor's structure.

Here is the new maze:

0 0 0 0 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
0 P 1 1 0 0 G

This new maze has the same dimensions as the original and incorporates a diagonal pathway that leads from 'P' to 'G', navigating around walls but does not copy the original's layout. The corridors are designed to form a diagonal path similar to the original maze but with distinct differences in the path's configuration.
