You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by moving the player from the current position (P) to an adjacent empty space. 

I'll choose to move right from the current position. The coordinates of the current position are (4,0), and the coordinates of the next position will be (4,1).

Please update the maze to reflect this move. The new maze should have the player position 'P' at (4,1). 

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4,1), I'll choose to move right again to an adjacent empty space. The coordinates of the next position will be (4,2).

Please update the maze to reflect this move. 

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4,2), I'll choose to move up to an adjacent empty space. However, directly above the current position is a wall. So, I'll move up and to the left, diagonally, to an empty space. The coordinates of the next position will be (3,1).

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

Next move: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3,1), I'll choose to move up to an adjacent empty space. There is a wall directly above the current position, but there is an empty space diagonally up and to the left at (2,0). However, I notice that the goal 'G' is at (2,2), which is diagonally up and to the right from the current position. So, I'll move to (2,2) to reach the goal.

Next move: (2,2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A diagonal corridor or a diagonal path.

Here is a new maze with the same size and a similar diagonal corridor shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a diagonal corridor that connects the start position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it has a similar shape and a valid path to the goal.
