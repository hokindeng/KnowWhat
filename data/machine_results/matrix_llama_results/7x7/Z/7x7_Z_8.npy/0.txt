You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move. 

From the initial position of the player, 'P', located at coordinates (4, 0), I can observe the surrounding area. There's a wall to my left and above me, but there are empty spaces to my right, below me, and diagonally down-right.

My goal, 'G', is located at coordinates (2, 2), which is a few steps away from my current position. Considering my immediate options, I can move right (4, 1), down (5, 0), or diagonally down-right (5, 1). Since I want to get closer to the goal, I will move right to explore and create future opportunities for moving up towards the goal.

My next move will be: (4, 1)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my new position at (4, 1), I re-evaluate the maze.

I'm now adjacent to another empty space to my right at (4, 2). However, I notice that moving up directly to reach the goal might be challenging due to the walls above me. Still, I want to make progress toward the goal.

I have several options for my next move: I can move up (3, 1), but that would put me into a potential dead end, right (4, 2), down (5, 1), diagonally up-right (3, 2), or diagonally down-right (5, 2). Considering these possibilities, moving right (4, 2) and then reassessing my situation seems like a good strategy, as this step allows me to move closer to the goal without immediately entering a potentially confined area.

My next move will be: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 2), I notice that I'm directly below the wall that blocks my direct path to the goal, 'G'. However, there's an empty space above that wall at (2, 2) which is the goal itself.

To move closer, I can move up (3, 2), but there's a wall there. I can move diagonally up-left (3, 1), which would put me into a new position. Considering my options, moving diagonally up-left (3, 1) appears to be the most promising, as it gets me one step closer to the goal while avoiding immediate obstacles.

My next move will be: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've made progress by moving to (3, 1).

Now that I'm at (3, 1), I notice that the goal, 'G', is only two steps away, diagonally up-right at (2, 2) and then up or right, but directly in front of me is a wall.

Considering my options, I can move diagonally up-right (2, 2), directly to the goal, 'G'. This move should allow me to bypass the wall and reach the goal immediately.

My next move will be: (2, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I can conclude that:

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is an "L-shape" (rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise), which is combined with a smaller, almost enclosed, space at the lower left.

Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has a similar L-shaped corridor and an almost enclosed space, but the layout of the empty spaces and walls is different from the original. The path from P to G in this new maze still requires navigating through the L-shape and into the upper area to reach the goal.
