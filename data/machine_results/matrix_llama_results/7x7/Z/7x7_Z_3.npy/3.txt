You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position (5, 3). However, please note that I am programmed to follow a specific format of interaction. Since I'm supposed to provide the "final answer" in a specific format, I'll adapt it to convey my next move as a pair of coordinates.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 3)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or "L-corridor," but more specifically, it's closer to an upside-down L with a short horizontal extension at the top. However, understanding that mazes can be somewhat subjective in interpretation, a simpler way to see it is as an "L-shape" with some modifications. For simplicity and clarity, let's refer to the corridors as forming an "L-shape."

Here's a new maze of the same size that incorporates the same "L-shape" concept but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze maintains the same L-shape concept but starts with a direct vertical corridor from the player's position 'P' that than opens to a horizontal extension towards the goal 'G'. It keeps the "L-shape" identifiable while rearranging the details to ensure it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
