You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position (5, 1). The coordinates represent the row and column, with (0,0) being the top left corner of the maze.

In the given maze, the current player position (P) is at coordinates (5, 1), but I will move to the adjacent empty space to the right, which is also at (5, 1) -> (5, 2) when counting, considering (5,1) the starting point but coordinates start from (0,0) so i move right so i increment the value so the correct answer would be (5,2).

I'll provide the correct answer according to 0s based so my answer is 
(5,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll make my next move to the position (5, 3). I'm moving to the adjacent empty space to the right.

Answer: (5,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Next, I'll move to the position (5, 4). I'm moving to the adjacent empty space to the right.

Answer: (5,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll move to the position (4, 4) would be moving up from my current P position or (4,4) .

 However this space is occupied by the 1 so i cant occupy it 

Let's go to (5,3) no that also would not work ... let's try going 4 then 

 (4,4) No 


 I'll move to the position (4, 1). Going up then left three spaces
 my P starts from(5,4) going up i am at  (4,4) so lets keep going left so it will be (4,3) then (4,2) then (4,1) where 0 is located also there now so it is a empty slot.

 
Answer: (4,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "Z-shaped" or "zig-zag" corridor.

Here's a new maze with the same size and shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same Z-shaped corridor, but with some adjustments to the wall layout. The path from P to G can be navigated through the empty spaces.
