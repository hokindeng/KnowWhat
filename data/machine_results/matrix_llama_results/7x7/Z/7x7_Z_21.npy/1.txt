You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (1, 1). The goal position 'G' is at coordinates (1, 4).

My next move would be to move down and to the right, but since I can only provide one set of coordinates, I will choose to move right. The new coordinates would be (1, 2).

Please update the maze with my new position and let me know the outcome.

Next move: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I am now closer to the goal position 'G' at (1, 4).

Since I can move diagonally, my next move would be to move diagonally up-right towards the goal position. However, since the up movement would put me back into the previous position, I will choose to move right again.

My next move would be to (1, 3).

Please update the maze with my new position.

Next move: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P G 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I am now very close to the goal position 'G' at (1, 4).

My next move would be to move right again, which would put me directly on top of the goal position 'G'.

Next move: (1, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L" shape or a Rectangular Corner shape.

This is because the empty spaces form a roughly rectangular shape with a corner, where the player can navigate from the starting position to the goal position.

Here is a new maze with the same size, where the empty spaces form a similar "L" shape or Rectangular Corner shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the player can navigate from the starting position "P" to the goal position "G" through the empty spaces, following a path that forms a similar "L" shape or Rectangular Corner shape.
