You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 P 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P). Since the coordinates of the top left corner are (0,0), the current player position (P) is at (2,2). I will move to the position (2,3), which is an empty space.

My next move coordinates are (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the left of the current player position (P), trying to get closer to the goal position (G). Since I'm currently at (2,3), I will move to the position (2,2).

However, I notice that I can also move diagonally to (2,1) or up to (1,3), but those would put me into a wall or not make progress towards the goal. A diagonal move to (1,2) is also not possible. Moving down to (3,3) is also not an option since it would not bring me closer to the goal.

My next move coordinates are (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 P 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back to the previous position. Now, I will make my next move to the left of the current player position (P), towards the goal position (G). I'm currently at (2,2), so I will move to the position (2,1).

My next move coordinates are (2,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm next to the goal position (G), my next move will be to the position of the goal (G) itself, which is at (2,0). 

My next move coordinates are (2,0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(distorted) ladder" or a " zigzag ladder".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag ladder" shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the player starts at position P (not shown, but would be placed at (4,1)), and the goal position G is at (2,0). The empty spaces form a zigzag ladder shape that allows the player to navigate from the start to the goal.
