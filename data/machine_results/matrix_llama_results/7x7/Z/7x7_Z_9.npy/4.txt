You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 P 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the empty space adjacent to the current player position 'P'. Since I can move diagonally, I will move to the space directly above the 'P'. The new coordinates will be the same x-coordinate but with a y-coordinate that is one less than the current y-coordinate.

The current position 'P' is at (2, 3), considering the top-left corner as (0, 0). Therefore, I will move to (2, 2).

My next move coordinates are (2, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L" shape

The original maze has a clear L-shaped path formed by the empty spaces, allowing the player to move from the starting position 'P' to the goal position 'G'.

Here is a new maze with the same size, a valid path from P to G, and the same L-shaped corridors:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 G
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same L-shaped corridors as the original, but with a different layout and position of the empty spaces, walls, and the player and goal positions.
