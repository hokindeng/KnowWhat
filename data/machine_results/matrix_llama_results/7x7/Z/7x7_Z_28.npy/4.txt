You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I'm starting at the position marked 'P', which appears to be at coordinates (3, 4), and my goal is to reach the position marked 'G' while avoiding walls and only moving through empty spaces, my first move would be to analyze the surroundings. 

Given the possibility to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, I notice that I can move either left, right, or diagonally. Moving up is not an option since there's a wall. Considering the goal is below and slightly to the left of my current position, an efficient move would be to move diagonally down and left to start heading towards the goal while utilizing the capability to move diagonally for more efficient navigation.

However, given the requirement to specify the exact coordinates of my next move and the current position being (3, 4), moving diagonally down and left would place me at coordinates (4, 3). This move makes sense as it not only brings me closer to the goal but also avoids walls and stays within empty spaces.

The coordinates of my next move are (4, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a diagonal corridor or a zigzag path. 

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar diagonal corridor or zigzag path:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 G 1

This new maze maintains the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces. It is not an identical copy of the original maze, but the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a diagonal corridor or zigzag path.
