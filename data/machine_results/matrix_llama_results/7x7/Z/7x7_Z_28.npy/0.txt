You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at row 3, column 4. The adjacent empty spaces are:

* Down: row 4, column 4
* Right: row 3, column 5
* Left: row 3, column 3 ( diagonal is also possible)
* Diagonal (down-left): row 4, column 3

Considering the available options, I will move down to row 4, column 4.

The coordinates of my next move are: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I have moved to row 4, column 4. My next step is to find the most suitable adjacent empty space to move into.

Considering the options:

* Left: row 4, column 3
* Diagonal (up-left): row 3, column 3
* Diagonal (down-left): row 5, column 3

I will move diagonally up-left to row 3, column 3. 

The coordinates of my next move are: (3,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I have moved to row 3, column 3. My next step is to find the most suitable adjacent empty space to move into.

Considering the options:

* Right: row 3, column 4
* Down: row 4 is blocked, but I can see empty spaces further down, I will plan a move to get closer to those
* Left: no empty spaces
* Diagonal (down-left): not helpful now

I will move right to row 3, column 4.

The coordinates of my next move are: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I have moved to row 3, column 4. My next step is to find the most suitable adjacent empty space to move into.

Considering the options:

* Right: row 3, column 5
* Down: row 4, column 4 is not available (blocked), but I can try further down
* Left: row 3, column 3
* Diagonal (down-left): not helpful now

Since moving right will not bring me closer to the goal G, and moving left is not helpful, I will move down and right diagonally is not possible. So, I will move right.

However, considering further steps and looking at the overall path, I will move right. 

The coordinates of my next move are: (3,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I have moved to row 3, column 5. My next step is to find the most suitable adjacent empty space to move into.

Considering the options:

* Down: I see that there are empty spaces below, I'll aim to get down to those
* Left: will not bring me closer to the goal
* Right: blocked by wall
* Diagonal (down-left): looks promising

I will move diagonally down-left to row 4, column 4.

However, I also see that a further down move can be made. Since I can see more empty spaces down at row 6, I will actually move diagonally down to row 5 column 4 and then down to 6 if possible

For now, row 4 is blocked, so I'll move to row 5 then down 

First I move to row 4, then down-left to 5.4. However now I can see the option to move down as more beneficial.

The coordinates of my next move are: (4 is blocked so we don't use this) (5,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a " Zigzag" or "Staircase" shape.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 G 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar Zigzag or Staircase shape, with a valid path from P to G that can be reached through the empty spaces.
