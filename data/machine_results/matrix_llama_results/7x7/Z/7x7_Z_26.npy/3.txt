You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P). I can move to the following adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: Not possible because it's a wall.
- Down: Not possible because it's a wall.
- Left: Not possible because it's a wall.
- Right: Possible because it's an empty space (0).
- Up-Left: Not possible because it's a wall.
- Up-Right: Not possible because it's a wall.
- Down-Left: Not possible because it's a wall.
- Down-Right: Not possible because it's a wall.

I will move right to the empty space. Since the current position (P) is at coordinates (0,4), my new position will be (0,5). Therefore, my next move is to coordinates (0,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P) again. I can move to the following adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: Not possible because it's a wall.
- Down: Not possible because it's a wall.
- Left: Possible because it's an empty space (0).
- Right: Not possible because it's a wall.
- Up-Left: Not possible because it's a wall.
- Up-Right: Not possible because it's a wall.
- Down-Left: Not possible because it's a wall.
- Down-Right: Not possible because it's a wall.

I will move left to the empty space. Since the current position (P) is at coordinates (0,5), my new position will be (0,4). Therefore, my next move is to coordinates (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems we're back to the previous position.

This time, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P) again and try a different approach. I can move to the following adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: Not possible because it's a wall.
- Down: Possible, but it's not the best move because there's a wall below that empty space.
- Left: Possible because it's an empty space (0).
- Right: Possible because it's an empty space (0).
- Up-Left: Not possible because it's a wall.
- Up-Right: Not possible because it's a wall.
- Down-Left: Not possible because it's a wall.
- Down-Right: Possible because it's an empty space.

However, moving left doesn't look like a good long-term strategy, and moving right would just put us back to the previous position. I'll try moving down-right to the empty space. Since the current position (P) is at coordinates (0,4), my new position will be (1,5). Therefore, my next move is to coordinates (1,5).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a diagonal zig-zag corridor.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria, with empty spaces forming the same diagonal zig-zag shape:


1 1 1 0 1 1 P
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same characteristic diagonal zig-zag shape formed by the empty spaces. The path from P to G can be navigated through these empty spaces.
