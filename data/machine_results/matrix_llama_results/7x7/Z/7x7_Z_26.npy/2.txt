You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I see that the current player position (P) is at coordinates (0,4). My objective is to navigate through the empty spaces and reach the goal position (G) at coordinates (3,4).

My possible next moves are:

- Up: (not possible, as there is a wall at (0,3) and (0,2) coordinates)
- Down: (0,5) is empty, but this might lead me further away from the goal
- Left: (0,3) is empty, and it's closer to the goal
- Right: (not possible, as there is a wall at (0,5) coordinates)
- Diagonal (Left-Down): (1,3) is empty, but this might lead me further away from the goal

Considering the above possibilities, I'll choose the Left direction as it brings me closer to the goal. 

So, my next move will be:

(0,3)

Please update the maze according to my move, and I'll plan the next step accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll analyze the situation and plan my next move.

I see that my current position (P) is at coordinates (0,3). My goal (G) is still at coordinates (3,4).

My possible next moves are:

- Up: (not possible, as there is a wall at (0,2) coordinates)
- Down: (0,4) is empty, and it's a good option to move down
- Left: (0,2) is empty, but moving left would take me away from the goal
- Right: (0,4) is empty, and it's also a good option to move right
- Diagonal (Down-Right): (1,4) is not empty, so this option is not valid

Considering the above possibilities, I'll choose to move down to (0,4) as it brings me closer to the goal and gives me more flexibility for future moves.

So, my next move will be:

(0,4)

Please update the maze according to my move, and I'll plan the next step accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll analyze the situation and plan my next move.

I see that my current position (P) is at coordinates (0,4). My goal (G) is still at coordinates (3,4).

My possible next moves are:

- Up: (not ideal, as I was already at this position and it didn't lead me to the goal)
- Down: (not possible, as there is a wall at (1,4) and further down coordinates)
- Left: (not ideal, as it would take me away from the goal)
- Right: (0,5) is empty, but it might not lead me directly to the goal
- Diagonal (Down-Right) and other diagonals are also not possible due to the walls

In this case, I need to think about a long-term plan to reach the goal. Since moving down is not possible, I'll aim to find a way to move around the wall that's blocking my path. I can do this by moving right, as it will give me more flexibility to find a new route.

So, my next move will be:

(0,5)

Please update the maze according to my move, and I'll plan the next step accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll analyze the situation and plan my next move.

I see that my current position (P) is at coordinates (0,5). My goal (G) is still at coordinates (3,4).

My possible next moves are:

- Up: (not ideal, as I was already in the upper area and it didn't lead me to the goal)
- Down: (not possible, as there is a wall at (1,5) and further down coordinates)
- Left: (0,4) is empty, and moving left might help me find a new route
- Right: (not possible, as there is a wall at (0,6) coordinates)
- Diagonal moves are also not possible due to the walls

Since I've reached the right edge of the maze, I'll move left to explore other possible routes. I'll try to find a way to move around the wall that's blocking my path to the goal.

So, my next move will be:

(0,4)

Wait, I've been here before! Moving left didn't help me previously. I need to reconsider my plan.

Let me re-evaluate the situation... Ah-ha! I see that I can move left to (0,4), but this time, I'll aim to move down to (1,4) in the next step, which will bring me closer to the goal.

So, my next move will indeed be:

(0,4)

Please update the maze according to my move, and I'll plan the next step accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back to a familiar position!

As I planned earlier, my next move will be to move down to (1,4). However, I notice that there's a wall at (1,4). But wait, I can move down to (1,3) instead, which might help me find a way to get closer to the goal.

My possible next moves are:

- Up: (not ideal, as I was already in the upper area and it didn't lead me to the goal)
- Down: (1,4) is not possible, but (1,3) is a viable option
- Left: (not ideal, as it would take me away from the goal)
- Right: (not ideal, as it would also take me away from the goal)
- Diagonal moves are also not possible due to the walls

So, my next move will be:

(1,3)

Please update the maze according to my move, and I'll plan the next step accordingly.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "**zig-zag channel**" or a "**serpentine path**".

Here's a new maze with the same size as the original, with empty spaces that form a zig-zag channel shape:


1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1


In this new maze, the player starts at position (3,0) marked by 'P', and the goal is at position (3,5) marked by 'G'. The player must navigate through the zig-zag channel to reach the goal.


Here's the corrected maze with 'P' and 'G' positions:


1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1 0 1
P 1 0 1 1 0 G
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
