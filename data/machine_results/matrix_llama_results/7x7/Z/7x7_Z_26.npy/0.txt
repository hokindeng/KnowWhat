You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position 'P' which is located at (0,4). 

Considering the adjacent positions, moving diagonally up-left or up-right is not an option because of the walls. Moving left or right also doesn't get us closer to the goal, which is located at (3,3) or (3,4) or (3,5), because there are walls blocking the direct paths. Therefore, a suitable move would be to move down to (1,4).

My next move would be to the coordinates (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position 'P', which is now located at (1,4).

There are walls in all directions except moving down to (2,4) or moving right to (1,5), but that would not bring us closer to the goal 'G'. However, moving down will potentially open up more paths. Moving left or diagonally is blocked by walls.

Considering this, my next move would be to the coordinates (2,4), down from the current position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "S-shape" or a "curved corridor".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same S-shape:


1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and forms an S-shape with its empty spaces. Note that it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
