You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am starting at the position 'P' which is located at the coordinates (5, 4). My goal 'G' is located at the coordinates (1, 5). Examining the maze, the next most logical step would be to move to an empty space that is closer to the goal while avoiding the walls. 

Considering the available options for the next move (including all eight directions: up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals), I choose to move up and to the left diagonally to the coordinates (4, 3). 

My next move will be to the position (4, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I can conclude that:

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) resembles a "**Zig-Zag**" or a "**Staircase**" pattern.

To generate a new maze with the same shape, I will recreate the zig-zag pattern using empty spaces. Here is the new maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar zig-zag pattern, and there is a valid path from P to G that can be reached through these empty spaces. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original maze.
