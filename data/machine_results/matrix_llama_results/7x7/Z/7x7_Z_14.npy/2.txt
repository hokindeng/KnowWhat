You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my first move.

First, I need to identify my current position (P) and the goal position (G). My current position is at (2, 3), and the goal position is at (0, 5).

My next move would be to move to the adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal. I will move diagonally up-left to the position (1, 2). However, this position is not empty (it's a wall). 

Instead, I can move to the position (2, 2), but it's also not empty. I will move to the position (2, 4), but it's also not empty. I can move to the position (1, 4), and it is empty. 

However, moving to (1,4) does not necessarily bring me closer to the goal in a significant way, considering the walls and my future moves.

A more strategic move would be to move to (3, 2) because this location is empty and offers more possibilities for the next step while moving in the general direction towards the goal.


Therefore, my next move is (3, 2).


(Please note that, given the rules of movement (up, down, left, right, and diagonals), multiple paths could potentially lead to the goal. My strategy prioritizes avoiding immediate obstacles while aiming for a broader range of future possibilities closer to the goal.)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move.

My current position (P) is at (3, 2), and the goal position (G) is still at (0, 5).

Since my goal is to move closer to the goal while avoiding walls, I need to navigate through the empty spaces below my current position to eventually reach the top row where the goal is located.

Looking at the maze, a viable next move would be to move down to (4, 2), which is an empty space. From there, I can further plan my route towards the goal.


Therefore, my next move is (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move.

My current position (P) is at (4, 2), and the goal position (G) is still at (0, 5).

I see that I have several options to move to adjacent empty spaces. Since the goal is located in the top row, I should aim to move up when possible. However, the space directly above me (3, 2) is empty, but I've been there before, and it doesn't bring me closer to the goal immediately.

Instead, I can move left to (4, 1), but this doesn't bring me closer to the goal either. Moving right to (4, 3) or further right to (4, 4), (4, 5), or (4, 6) (before the wall) also doesn't bring me closer to the goal, but it sets me up for future moves.

Considering the layout and the goal, a more strategic move would be to move right to (4, 3), and then reassess for the next step.


Therefore, my next move is (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move.

My current position (P) is at (4, 3), and the goal position (G) is still at (0, 5).

From my current position, I can move right to (4, 4) or further right to (4, 5), which would put me closer to the column where the goal is located. However, moving up is still the ultimate goal.

Moving up from (4, 3) is not an option since (3, 3) is a wall. However, if I move right to (4, 4), I still won't be able to move up. If I move right to (4, 5), I also won't be able to move up due to the wall.

Given the constraints, I should aim to move to a position where I can move up and eventually reach the goal.


Considering my options, moving right to (4, 4) sets me up for limited future moves, but it gives me more flexibility for the next move.


Therefore, my next move is (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move.

My current position (P) is at (4, 4), and the goal position (G) is still at (0, 5).

Since the goal is located above me and to the left slightly, I should consider moving up when possible, while avoiding the walls.


Considering my current position (4, 4), I can see that the space directly above me (3, 4) is not accessible, as it is a wall. I can move left to (4, 3), but I was there previously, and it doesn't bring me closer to the goal immediately.


However, I notice that I can move right to (4, 5), which would put me directly below the goal in terms of columns, making it more feasible to move up towards the goal later.


Therefore, my next move is (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move.

My current position (P) is at (4, 5), and the goal position (G) is still at (0, 5).

Now that I'm in the same column as the goal, I should aim to move up towards the goal. Looking at the maze, I can see that the space directly above me (3, 5) is a wall, so I won't be able to move there.


However, I notice that there is an empty space at (1, 5), which is closer to the goal. To reach this space, I'll need to move up and navigate through the empty space at (2, 5), but it's blocked by the wall at (3, 5), (2, 5), and (2, 4). On the other hand, (1, 4) is empty, and this could help.


A viable path to the goal involves moving left to (4, 4), then I must find a way up.


Therefore, my next move is (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move.

My current position (P) is at (4, 4), and the goal position (G) is still at (0, 5).

As mentioned previously, I should aim to move up towards the goal. Since there's a wall directly above me (3, 4), I should explore alternative paths.


I can move left to (4, 3), but I was there previously, and it doesn't bring me closer to the goal immediately.


However, if I move left to (4, 3), and then up isn't available, I can move left again to (4, 2), and from there to (4, 1), and then I see I can move up.


But there is also a space at (3, 1), so I should move towards that to see if that gives me access to the goal.


So I can move to (4, 3), then to (4, 2), then to (4, 1), then up to (3, 1). 


But since I can only do one step, my next move is (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move.

My current position (P) is at (4, 3), and the goal position (G) is still at (0, 5).


I was aiming to move towards (3, 1) as mentioned in my previous move, so I can now move left to (4, 2), then to (4, 1), then up to (3, 1).


But since I can only do one step, my next move is (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move.

My current position (P) is at (4, 2), and the goal position (G) is still at (0, 5).


I can now move left to (4, 1), then up to (3, 1).


But since I can only do one step, my next move is (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move.

My current position (P) is at (4, 1), and the goal position (G) is still at (0, 5).


As mentioned earlier, I can now move up to (3, 1). From there, I'll be closer to the goal and can reassess the path.


My next move is (3, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(distorted) Hourglass" shape. The path starts wide at the top and bottom, narrows down in the middle, and then widens again.


Here is a new maze with the same size and a valid path from P to G that forms a similar "Hourglass" shape:


1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1


Please note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze but maintains a similar "Hourglass" shape in its empty spaces.
