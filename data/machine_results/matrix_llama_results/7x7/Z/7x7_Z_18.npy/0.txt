You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P). Since the current position of 'P' is at (2,1), my next move will be to the position (2,2).

My next move is to the coordinates: (2,2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since my current position is (2,2), my next move will be to the right again. I'll move to the position (2,3).

My next move is to the coordinates: (2,3)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving to the right. My current position is (2,3), and I'll move to the position (2,4).

My next move is to the coordinates: (2,4)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.My current position is (2,4). I can see a path downwards, so my next move will be down. I'll move to the position (3,4), but since there's a wall, I'll go to (4 is not an option) position (3,4 +1 doesn't work but going diagonal to 3,5 will not)  actually going down one to (3,4) does indeed have a wall I will try moving down then moving a square right. moving down one will put me in an invalid spot so I go (4,5) using a right diagonal move
 move is to the coordinates: (4,5)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L" shape or a variation of it, with a rectangular section connected to a smaller rectangular or square section.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 P 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar "L" shape, with a rectangular section connected to a smaller rectangular section. The path from P to G is not identical to the original maze, but it can be reached through empty spaces.
