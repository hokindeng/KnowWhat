You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P). Since the current position of 'P' is at (2,1), my next move will be to the position (2,2).

My next move is to the coordinates: (2,2)

Please provide the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P). Since the current position of 'P' is at (2,2), my next move will be to the position (2,3).

My next move is to the coordinates: (2,3)

Please provide the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P). Since the current position of 'P' is at (2,3), my next move will be to the position (2,4).

My next move is to the coordinates: (2,4)

Please provide the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P). Since the current position of 'P' is at (2,4), my next move will be to the position (2,5).

My next move is to the coordinates: (2,5)

Please provide the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I've reached the rightmost edge of the empty space on this row, I'll now make a downward move to get closer to the goal position (G). Since the current position of 'P' is at (2,5), my next move will be to the position (3,5).

However, the maze structure doesn't allow me to move down to (3,5) as it is a wall. Instead, I will move down to (3,4), where the space is empty.

My next move is to the coordinates: (3,4)

Please provide the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will make my next move to the left of the current player position (P). Since the current position of 'P' is at (3,4), my next move will be to the position (3,3). However, the space at (3,3) is a wall. I will move left again and choose the position (3,2) doesn't work either as it is also a wall. Then, the next left position would be (3,1), no good as well. Then (3,0), once again that is a wall. No leftward moves available. I will move right but the space at (3,5) is a wall as well. Then my only option to move toward the goal is to move downward to the position (4,4).


However the space at (4,4) has a wall. We will choose a different route down. One option is moving down diagonally one space to the right to coordinates (4,5), that is a wall as well. Another option down to the left is at (4,3), That would be an open space.


My next move is to the coordinates: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since the current position of 'P' is at (4,3), my next move will be to move down the space at (5,3), which is a wall, so that won't be possible. The spaces (5,2) is available though.


My next move is to the coordinates: (5,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will make my next move to the left of the current player position (P) or downward and to the left toward the goal. The current position of 'P' is at (5,2) so I can only go down and left. Since I can only move to (6,2), (6,1) or (6,0), but then only (6,1) and (6,0) and (6,2) and other moves as I approached but my goal was to move the player down, by going from (5,2) to the position that brings me closer to my goal (G), The available options would be to move (6,1), so that is where I want to go.


My next move is to the coordinates: (6,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since the current position of 'P' is at (6,1) and the goal 'G' is at (6,3) I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P), closer to the goal 'G'. 


My next move is to the coordinates: (6,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 P G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P), to the position of the goal (G). Since the current position of 'P' is at (6,2), my next move will be to the position (6,3), where 'G' is located.


My next move is to the coordinates: (6,3)

This move should conclude the maze, as I will have reached the goal position 'G'.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(mostly) straight pathway with a single turning point near the goal" but as an L-shape since if I would represent its longest extension, with its minor turning point to form a different pathway adjoining its long pathway it has L-characteristics, however simplified the major definition best be "an L-shape" .

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 0 P 0 G 1 1
