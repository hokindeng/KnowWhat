You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. I am currently at position 'P' which seems to be at coordinates (5, 1). My goal is 'G' at coordinates (5, 4).

My next move will be to the right towards the goal, while staying in the empty spaces. So, I will move to the position at coordinates (5, 2).

The new coordinates after my move will be (5, 2). 

Please provide the updated maze after this move so I can plan my next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I see that I have successfully moved to the position (5, 2).

Next, I will move to the right again, towards the goal, which is still at coordinates (5, 4). Since the space at (5, 3) is empty ('0'), I can move there safely.

The coordinates of my next move are (5, 3).

Please provide the updated maze after this move so I can plan my next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've made it closer to the goal.

Since the goal is right next to me at coordinates (5, 4), I will simply move right to reach it.

The coordinates of my next move are (5, 4).

This should be the final move to solve the maze. Let me know if I've successfully reached the goal!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape, similar to the original maze. The maze has the same size, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original.
