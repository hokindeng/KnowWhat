You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P). I can move to an empty space that is adjacent to the current position.

Here is the maze with the coordinates:

(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2)  (0,3)  (0,4)  (0,5)  (0,6)
 0    0    0    0    G    1    1
(1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)  (1,3)  (1,4)  (1,5)  (1,6)
 1    1    1    0    1    1    1
(2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)  (2,3)  (2,4)  (2,5)  (2,6)
 1    1    P    1    1    1    1

 1    1    1    1    1    1    1

The current player position is at (2,2), and the only valid move is to (3,1). Therefore, I will choose:

Next move: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P).

The current player position is at (3,1). The valid moves are to (2,1), (4,1), or (3,0). However, moving to (2,1) would put me back in the previous position, which is not optimal. The best options are to move to (4,1) or (3,0). Since my goal is to get to (0,4), I will choose to move upwards to (2,1) and then continue moving left is not the best idea. Therefore I will choose:

Next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P).

The current player position is at (4,1). I can move to (3,1), (4,0), (5,1), (4,2), (3,2) but since (3,2) has a wall, I can rule it out.  Since my goal is to get to (0,4), I will choose to move upwards is not the best option now. Therefore I will move to the right (4,2) 

Next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P).

The current player position is at (4,2). I can move to (4,1), (4,3), (5,2), or (3,2) is ruled out because is a wall. Since my goal is to get to (0,4), I will choose to move upwards is not the best option now, I will move to the right to (4,3)

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P).

The current player position is at (4,3). I can move to (4,2), (4,4), (3,3) is ruled out because is a wall or (5,3) is also ruled out. Since my goal is to get to (0,4), I will choose to move upwards is not the best option now, I will move to the right (4,4)

Next move: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P).

The current player position is at (4,4). I can move to (3,4), (4,3), or (5,4) is ruled out because is a wall, also any other direction is ruled out by walls. Since my goal is to get to (0,4), I will choose to move upwards (3,4) is not the best option since (2,4) and (1,4) have a wall so I will go left first to have more mobility 

Next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back to this position.

With the updated maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P).

The current player position is at (4,3). I can move to (4,2), (4,4),  (3,3) is ruled out because is a wall or (5,3) is also ruled out. Since my goal is to get to (0,4), I will choose to move upwards is not the best option now, I will move to the right (4,4) again

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P).

The current player position is at (4,4). I can move to (4,3),  (3,4) since the rest of directions are walls. Since my goal is to get to (0,4), I will choose to move upwards to (3,4)

Next move: (3,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "Z-Shape" or "Angular Shape"

The corridors in the original maze form a Z-like shape, with two distinct turns that allow the player to move from the starting point (P) to the goal (G).

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

(2) New Maze:

0 1 1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The corridors in this maze also form a Z-like shape, although the exact layout is different from the original maze.
