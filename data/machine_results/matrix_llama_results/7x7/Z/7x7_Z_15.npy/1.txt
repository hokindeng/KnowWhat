You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (4, 2).

Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position, I will examine the surrounding cells:

- Up: (3, 2) is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
- Down: (5, 2) is an empty space (0), so it's a valid move.
- Left: (4, 1) is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
- Right: (4, 3) is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
- Diagonals: (3, 1), (3, 3), (5, 1), and (5, 3) are all walls or out of bounds, except for (5, 1), which is an empty space but moving there would not bring me closer to the goal.

Considering the options, the best move is to go down to the empty space at coordinates (5, 2).

Next move: (5, 2)

Please provide the updated maze for further navigation.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the possible moves from the current position.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (5, 2).

I will examine the surrounding cells:

- Up: (4, 2) is an empty space (0), but I just came from there, so moving back up would not bring me closer to the goal.
- Down: Not possible, as I'm already at the bottom of the maze.
- Left: (5, 1) is an empty space (0), so it's a valid move.
- Right: (5, 3) is an empty space (0) and it's closer to the goal (G), so it's a good move.
- Diagonals: (4, 1), (4, 3), and others are either walls or not closer to the goal.

Considering the options, the best move is to go right to the empty space at coordinates (5, 3).

However, I notice that the goal (G) is at coordinates (5, 4), which is adjacent to the position I would be moving into. Since I can move diagonally or to any adjacent empty space, I will instead plan ahead to move to the goal directly.

Next move: (5, 3) could be a good move, but an even better move is to head directly to the goal.

Next move: (5, 4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a zigzag or a somewhat diagonal path.

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a **Diagonal Zigzag** or a **Staircase** shape.

Here's a new maze with the same size (7x7) and a valid path from P to G that forms a similar Diagonal Zigzag or Staircase shape:

1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 0 0 G
1 P 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1

This new maze has a similar Diagonal Zigzag or Staircase shape formed by the empty spaces, but it's not an identical copy of the original maze. The path from P to G can be reached through the empty spaces, and it requires some diagonal movements to navigate.
