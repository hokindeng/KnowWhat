You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P). It seems the only empty space adjacent to P is directly above it. Therefore, my next move would be to move up.

So, the coordinates of my next move would be one space above the current position of P. If the coordinates of P are (4, 2), considering the top-left corner as (0, 0), then my next move would be to (3, 2).

Please update the maze according to this move or provide feedback if this is not a valid move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a zigzag path or an "S-shape" with a straight section at the bottom.

Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same general shape:


1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 0 1
1 P 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces (0s) also form a zigzag path with a straight section at the bottom, connecting P to G through a valid path.
