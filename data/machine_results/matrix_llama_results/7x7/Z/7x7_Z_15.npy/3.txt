You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (4,2), and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (5,3). 

My next move will be to move to the empty space diagonally down and to the right, which is coordinates (5,3), but I see that's the goal, and there's a wall between us. So I'll choose the closest available empty space to the goal.

My next move is to the empty space directly down from the current position 'P', which is coordinates (5,2).

Please let me know the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I've moved to coordinates (5,2). 

My next move is to the empty space to the right of the current position 'P', which is coordinates (5,3). This move brings me closer to the goal position 'G'.

Let me know the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to coordinates (5,3). Since the goal position 'G' is adjacent to my current position, I can move to it directly.

My next move is to the goal position 'G', which is at coordinates (5,4).

This should complete the maze solution. Please confirm!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a "bent tunnel". The empty spaces form a roughly L-shaped corridor that connects the start position 'P' to the goal position 'G'.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 P G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces also form an L-shape or bent tunnel, but the layout is different from the original maze. The player can navigate from the start position 'P' to the goal position 'G' through the empty spaces.
