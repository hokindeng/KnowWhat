You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P).

My current position is at coordinates (3, 2) since the top-left corner is (0, 0). I will move to the right, which means my new position will be at coordinates (3, 3).

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at coordinates (3, 3), my next move will be down to the empty space below my current position.

I will move to coordinates (4, 3).

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at coordinates (4, 3), I see that I'm blocked by a wall on my left and right sides, but there's an empty space on my left two positions away from my current position (due to the wall at (4,2)).

I will make a diagonal move down-left to avoid the wall and get closer to the goal. However, I will first move to the empty space directly below my current left adjacent wall to ensure I remain within possible maze rules. I will move down to coordinates (5, 2).

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at coordinates (5, 2), my next move will be down to the goal position (G).

I will move to coordinates (6, 0) but since I can also move diagonally to empty spaces, I will instead move diagonally to coordinates (6, 1) and then would likely be able to move left into (6,0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(distorted) stairway" or an "angled zig-zag".

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 G 0 0 0 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar stairway or angled zig-zag shape, while not being an identical copy of the original maze. The player can navigate from the starting position (P) to the goal position (G) by moving through the empty spaces.
