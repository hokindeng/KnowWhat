You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P). Since the current position of P is at (3, 2), my next move will be to the coordinate (3, 3).

So, my answer is: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since my current position is (3, 3) and my goal is to reach G, my next move will be down to the coordinate (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.My current position is (4, 3). I'll try to move down again to get closer to G. Since the space directly below me is a wall, I will move diagonally down and left to the coordinate (5, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting close to G. Since my current position is (5, 2) and the space below me contains G, I'll try to move down to the coordinate (6, 2) to reach G directly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 G P 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since my current position is (6, 2) and the goal G is also at the same position as me but I am supposed to occupy that space, I can actually stop here and say that I have reached the goal.

However, I assume that you want me to "step on" the goal, effectively moving to the same space as G. Since I've already done that, I'll just stay at the same position and say that I've reached the goal.

But, I assume the problem wants me to fully occupy the goal's space alone. In that case, I am done as I am already at that space.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A " stairway" or " stepped path" shape, where a series of diagonal moves lead from the starting point to the goal.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 0 0 1

The empty spaces in this new maze form a similar stairway or stepped path shape, allowing the player to move from P to G through a series of diagonal and horizontal moves. This maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same overall shape and structure.
