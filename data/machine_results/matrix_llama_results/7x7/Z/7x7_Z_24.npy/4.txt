You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves step-by-step to reach the goal position (G).

The initial maze is:

0 G 0 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (0, 3). My goal is to reach the goal position (G) at coordinates (0, 1).

My next move is to move diagonally up-left to the empty space at coordinates (0, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 2)

Please provide the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G P 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (0, 2) and I see that the goal position (G) is just to my left.

My next move is to move left to the goal position (G) at coordinates (0, 1).

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 1)

I should reach the goal with this move. Please confirm!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I can see that the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a "diagonal zig-zag" or a "zig-zag staircase".

To create a new maze that meets the criteria, I will generate a new maze with the same size as the original (7x7) and a valid path from P to G that forms a similar zig-zag staircase shape.

Here is the new maze:


0 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G P 1


This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, it includes a valid path from P to G, it's not an identical copy of the original, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a zig-zag staircase.
