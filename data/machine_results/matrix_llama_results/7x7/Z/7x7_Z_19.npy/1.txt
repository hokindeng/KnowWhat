You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G', I need to move through empty spaces. 

My current position is at the last row where 'P' is located. Since the maze allows diagonal, horizontal, and vertical moves, my first move will be to move diagonally up and to the right to get closer to the goal and to avoid being blocked by the walls below and to the left of my current position.

The coordinates of my next move will be (4, 5) since my current position 'P' seems to be at (5, 5), moving diagonally up-right to (4, 6) might put me into a wall based on the maze layout provided, so it seems the best move is to go straight up.

However, considering standard 0-based indexing, and assuming the description starts counting rows and columns from 1 for simplicity, this translates to moving from what appears to be row 5, column 5, to row 4, column 5 in a 0-based index system.

Therefore, I would suggest moving to (4,5) assuming the coordinates (rows and columns) start counting from 0.

In the context of steps that actually align with common indexing (starting from 0), considering my misinterpretation, if "P" is indeed at what I perceive as (5,5) under a 1-based index assumption due to how the maze is visually presented, the move to directly above "P" would be accurately described in 0-based indexing, which might be the actual system in use here.

However, to clarify based on the presentation that seems to start counting from 1 for simplicity in explanation:
- The actual move considering standard 0-based indexing would be from (5,5) to (4,5) under the incorrect assumption of starting from 1 for explanation's sake.

Correcting for the logical oversight: Since, visually, the maze's description starts from what appears to be (1,1) as the top-left corner, my initial interpretation miscounts. The "P" seems to be on the row that starts with a '1' which is visually 6th but should be considered 5th in 0-based indexing. The move is thus corrected in intention but needs clarification for accurate 0-based indexing representation, implying a move directly up, meaning to the row above in the provided 2D grid representation.

Given this maze:
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

My next move, aligning with the corrected understanding, assuming a start from 0 for indexing and based on my analysis aiming to reach 'G', is to move up to the position directly above 'P'.

Correctly, considering 0-based indexing:
- 'P' is actually at what I will correct to row (4, 5) because we count from 0.
- The move is to go directly above this, to row (3, 5), which accurately reflects a move in the 0-based coordinate system.

Therefore, the accurate 0-based coordinate after correcting my approach for the described motion up from 'P' would indeed correctly index this move without further misinterpretation as going from the position 'P' appears to occupy on careful reevaluation, to the spot directly above it, facilitating navigation towards 'G' while adhering to the constraints and possibilities defined by the maze's layout and permissible movements.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as roughly resembling a diagonal "staircase" or "diagonal ladder" with a bent or kink near the goal position. However, a more abstract description might refer to its overall structure as a type of irregular, diagonal "path" or "corridor" with a specific turn near the goal, 'G'.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form a similar diagonal path shape. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original but maintains a recognizable diagonal path structure leading from 'P' to 'G':

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces, preserving the diagonal path structure characteristic of the original maze. The path structure, while not an identical copy, maintains the essence of a diagonal movement with a clear path to the goal, 'G'.
