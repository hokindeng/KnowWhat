You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P). I can move to the empty space above, below, left, right, or diagonally. Since I can only move through empty spaces, I will choose the most promising direction to reach the goal.

My current position is at the 5th row and 5th column (0-indexed). I will choose to move diagonally up-left to the empty space at coordinates (4,4). This move is chosen because it gets me closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

The coordinates of my next move are: (4,4)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and provide the updated maze for my next move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "inverted L-shape" or a "bent rectangle". However, a more accurate description would be that the empty spaces form a "step" or a "stairway" shape, as there are two adjacent rectangles of empty spaces, one of which is shifted down by one row.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "step" or "stairway" shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 0

This new maze meets the criteria, as it has the same size, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy, and its empty spaces form a recognizable "step" or "stairway" shape.
