You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is represented by 'P', which is located at coordinates (4, 4). To plan the next move, I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The empty spaces adjacent to 'P' are:

* Up: (3, 4) is blocked by a wall
* Down: (5, 4) is blocked by a wall
* Left: (4, 3) is blocked by a wall
* Right: (4, 5) is blocked by a wall
* Up-Left: (3, 3) is blocked by a wall
* Up-Right: (3, 5) is empty
* Down-Left: (5, 3) is blocked by a wall
* Down-Right: (5, 5) is blocked by a wall

Considering the available options, the next move will be to the up-right position (3, 5).

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is represented by 'P', which is located at coordinates (3, 5). To plan the next move, I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The empty spaces adjacent to 'P' are:

* Up: (2, 5) is empty
* Down: (4, 5) is blocked by a wall
* Left: (3, 4) is blocked by a wall
* Right: (3, 6) is blocked by a wall
* Up-Left: (2, 4) is blocked by a wall
* Up-Right: (2, 6) is blocked by a boundary
* Down-Left: (4, 4) is empty but blocked by the wall below
* Down-Right: (4, 6) is blocked by a boundary

Considering the available options, the next move will be up to position (2, 5).

However, I notice that the maze structure suggests that moving to (2, 5) may lead to an optimal path. Once in position (2, 5), future moves would likely go left and attempt to find the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are indeed: (2, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is represented by 'P', which is located at coordinates (2, 5). To plan the next move, I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The empty spaces adjacent to 'P' are:

* Left: (2, 4), (2, 3), and (2, 2) are empty
* Right: (2, 6) is empty
* Up and down: are blocked by walls
* Diagonals other than up-left are either blocked by walls or out of bounds

Considering the goal is located at the bottom-left part of the maze, my next move should aim to get closer to the goal. I will move left.

The coordinates of my next move are indeed: (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is represented by 'P', which is located at coordinates (2, 4). To plan the next move, I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The empty spaces adjacent to 'P' are:

* Left: (2, 3) and (2, 2) are empty
* Right: (2, 5) is empty, but I just came from there
* Down-left and down: are blocked by walls
* Other directions are out of bounds or blocked by walls

Considering the goal is located at the bottom-left part of the maze, my next move should aim to get closer to the goal. I will move left.

The coordinates of my next move are indeed: (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

* Other directions are out of bounds or blocked by walls

Considering the goal is located at the bottom-left part of the maze, my next move should aim to get closer to the goal. I will move left.

The coordinates of my next move are indeed: (2, 2).

Considering the goal is located at the bottom-left part of the maze, my next move should aim to find a way down. I will need to move right to potentially create a path down.

The coordinates of my next move are indeed: (2 is not moving, changing to) (3, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A Staircase or a Zigzag

The empty spaces in the original maze form a staircase-like shape, with alternating horizontal and vertical segments.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0

This new maze meets the criteria:

* Same size as the original maze (7x7)
* Includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
* Not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as a Staircase or Zigzag
