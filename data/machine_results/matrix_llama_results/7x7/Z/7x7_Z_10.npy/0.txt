You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P). Since the coordinates of the top left corner are (0,0), the current player position (P) is at (1,3). I will move to the position (1,4), which is an empty space.

My next move is to the coordinates (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since my current position is (1,4), I will now move down to the empty space at (2,4), but since (2,4) is a wall, I will move diagonally down-left to (2,3) which is an empty space.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since my current position is (2,3), I will move down to the goal position (G) which is below me at (3,3) but also adjacent to the wall, however (3,3)  does have a wall below (3,3), at (4,3) there is an empty space below the wall and left from it that I can move diagonally down-left and after reach the G if possible but first I will try moving down right which allows diagonal moves, then down to get the G (two moves).
However I need to start with moving down to the right to coordinates (3,4) then next move down left.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a "corner shape".


Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
