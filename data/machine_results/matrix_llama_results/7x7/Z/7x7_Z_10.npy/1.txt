You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P).

My current position is (1,3), and I will move to (1,4), which is an empty space.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Initial Move: (1,4)

Please provide the updated maze for my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move down and to the left, diagonally.

My current position is (1,4), and I will move to (2,3), which is an empty space.

Next Move: (2,3)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move down to the goal position (G).

My current position is (2,3), and I will move to (3,3), which is the goal position (G).

However, since I can only move to an empty space, and the goal position is not an empty space, I will move to the left of the goal position, which is an empty space is not available. I will move to (3,2), is also not available, I will try to move down one more position to (4,3) to get around the goal position.

Wait, there is an available empty space at (4,3). Next Move: (4,3)

Although this is not the goal, this will allow me to get closer in order to move to the goal on the next turn.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(distorted) **Z-shape**".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 G 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a distorted Z-shape, similar to the original maze.

RECOGNIZE: SUCCESS

GENERATE: FAIL
