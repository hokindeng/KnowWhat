You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 G 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To start solving the maze, I'll identify the current position of the player 'P' and the goal 'G'. The player is at (5, 4), and the goal is at (4, 3).

Given my current position, my options to move are limited because I am in a corner. However, I can move diagonally up-left to position (4, 3), but that's where the goal 'G' is, and the task is to avoid landing directly on 'G' but to move towards it through empty spaces. Another option is to move directly up to (4, 4). This move will get me closer to the goal and keep me in an empty space.

Therefore, my next move would be to the coordinates (4, 4).

Please update the maze to reflect this move, and I will plan the next step accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 G P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, my current position is (4, 4), and the goal 'G' is at (4, 3), adjacent to me.

Since the goal is directly to my left, and I'm tasked with finding a step-by-step solution without landing directly on 'G' in the previous step, my next move should bring me closer while respecting the rules. However, considering the initial instructions were to move towards the goal through empty spaces while the goal itself wasn't explicitly stated as a space to avoid landing on directly, the logical next step to adhere strictly to the instructions provided would be to move to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to the coordinates (4, 3), the position of 'G'.

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag" or more broadly, a form of a "serpentine" path.

Here's a new maze with the same size, where the empty spaces form a similar serpentine path:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 P G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the path from 'P' to 'G' follows a similar serpentine shape through the empty spaces, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
