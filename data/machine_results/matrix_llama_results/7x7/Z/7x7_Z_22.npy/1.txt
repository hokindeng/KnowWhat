You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 G 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (4,5). The goal is at position G (4,3). To navigate to the goal, I will move to an adjacent empty space. Upon examining the maze, I find that I can move to the empty space to my left, which is at coordinates (4,4).

Therefore, my next move will be to (4,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 G P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I've moved to position (4,4). Now, to get closer to the goal at position G (4,3) or possibly create a path towards it, I need to examine the available adjacent empty spaces.

Considering my current position, P (4,4), and the goal position, G (4,3), I can move to the empty space that is now directly to my left, which is actually the goal itself. Therefore, my next move will be to (4,3), effectively reaching the goal position G.

My next move will be to (4,3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or "Elbow shape" since it has a distinctive right-angled bend. This shape is comprised of two connected segments: one running horizontally and another running vertically.

Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 G 1 P
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar L-shape, with the added twist that the goal (G) is positioned near the corner of the "L" and the player (P) is positioned near the end of the horizontal segment. This will require the player to navigate the entire shape to reach the goal. The new maze meets the specified criteria, having the same size, a non-identical layout, and a valid path from P to G through the L-shaped empty spaces.
