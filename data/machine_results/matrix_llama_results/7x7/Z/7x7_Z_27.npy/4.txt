You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P).

My current position is (3, 3). I will move to (3, 4), which is an empty space.

Please update the maze and present it to me again.

Next move coordinates: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P).

My current position is (3, 4). I will move to (3, 5), which is an empty space.

Next move coordinates: (3, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P).

My current position is (3, 5). I will move to (3, 6), which is an empty space.

Next move coordinates: (3, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've reached the right edge of the current row, I'll move down to the row below, which will bring me closer to the goal (G).

My current position is (3, 6). I will move to (4, 6), but that's a wall (1), so I'll move to (4, 5), which is an empty space.

Next move coordinates: (4, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.My current position is (4, 5). To get closer to the goal (G), I will move down.

I will move to (5, 5), which is a wall (1), so I'll consider the adjacent empty spaces. A possible move is to (5, 4), but that would also move me away from the goal (G) in the horizontal direction. A better move would be to (5, 6) or further to the right isn't a good option, but I'll move down further right below, so I move (6, 4), no (6,4) isn't right because then I'll be in the 6 row in column 4, to G when I move to the 4 column in the 5 row, more one, then P would be on top of the G then that means I solved it

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A staircase or a diagonal path with right-angle turns.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 G 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and forms a similar staircase or diagonal path with right-angle turns.
