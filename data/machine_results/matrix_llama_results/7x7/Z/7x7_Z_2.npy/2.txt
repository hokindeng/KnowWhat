You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves. To start, I need to locate the current position of the player (P) and identify the possible moves from there. The player is at coordinates (3, 1), considering (0,0) as the top-left corner. 

Given the rules that I can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any empty space (0), I'll analyze the surroundings of the player:

- Moving up (3, 0) is not possible because it's a wall (1).
- Moving up-left (2, 0) is not possible because it's a wall (1).
- Moving left (3, 0) is not possible because it's a wall (1).
- Moving down-left (4, 0) is not possible because it's a wall (1).
- Moving down (4, 1) is not possible because it's a wall (1).
- Moving down-right (4, 2) is not possible because it's a wall (1).
- Moving right (3, 2) is possible because it's an empty space (0).
- Moving up-right (2, 2) is possible because it's an empty space (0).

Out of the possible moves, moving right seems like the most straightforward option that keeps me closer to the goal (G) while ensuring I don't block myself off from future moves. Thus, my next move is to (3, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I am now at (3, 2). I'll analyze my surroundings:

- My goal (G) is located at (0, 4), so I aim to move in a general direction towards it, considering the restrictions of the maze.

Given the layout, my next move should get me closer to the goal or at least to a position that allows for further progress. Moving diagonally up-right to (2, 3) seems to be an efficient choice because it brings me closer to the goal both horizontally and vertically, and it is an empty space.

Therefore, my next move is to (2, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as resembling a "staircase" or more broadly, an irregular diagonal path with steps or platforms at different levels. However, a more precise geometric description of such paths in mazes often doesn't fit perfect geometric shapes due to their irregular nature. But for simplicity, we can consider it as forming a kind of diagonal or stepped path.

2. Here is a new maze with the same size as the original (7x7) and with empty spaces forming a similar diagonal or stepped path shape. This maze includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces and is not an identical copy of the original.
