You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (3, 1) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (0, 4).

My next move will be to the right, to the empty space at coordinates (3, 2). This move is chosen to move closer to the goal while avoiding the walls.

So, my next move is to coordinates (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I have moved one step to the right. My new position 'P' is at coordinates (3, 2).

My next move will be to the right again, to the empty space at coordinates (3, 3). This move continues the path towards the goal, navigating around the walls.

So, my next move is to coordinates (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved another step to the right. My current position 'P' is at coordinates (3, 3).

My next move will be to the right again, to the empty space at coordinates (3, 4). This move brings me closer to the goal while staying in the corridor of empty spaces.

So, my next move is to coordinates (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've reached the end of the corridor. My current position 'P' is at coordinates (3, 4).

My next move will be to move up, to the empty space at coordinates (2, 4) doesn't seem feasible due to the wall. I'll try moving diagonally up-left to coordinates (2, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path" that connects the starting point P to the goal point G.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 G
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape that connects the starting point P to the goal point G, similar to the original maze. Note that this is not an identical copy of the original maze, but rather a new maze with the same general shape.
