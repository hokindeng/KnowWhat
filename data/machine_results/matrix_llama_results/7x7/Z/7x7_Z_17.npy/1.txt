You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P).

My current position is at (1,2), and I will move to (1,3).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (1,3).

Please let me know if this is a valid move and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move down to the empty space below the current player position (P).

My current position is at (1,3), and I will move to (2,3).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (2,3).

Wait, I see that the position (2,3) is a wall! I made a mistake.

Let me correct my move. I will move to the right of the current player position (P).

My current position is at (1,3), and I will move to (1,4).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move down and to the right to the empty space below and to the right of the current player position (P).

My current position is at (1,4), and I will move to (2,5).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (2,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move down to the empty space below the current player position (P).

My current position is at (2,5), and I will move to (3,5).

No, wait, I see that the position (3,5) has a wall to the right of the empty space, and to the left there is also a wall. But I also see a possible path, if I move down and to the left of my current position.

My current position is at (2,5), and I will move to (3,4).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (3,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move down to the empty space below the current player position (P) and the goal position (G).

My current position is at (3,4), and I will move to (4,4) but then I also see the goal.

However, I will first confirm there are no walls, then proceed with making my move to the goal.

My current position is at (3,4), and I will move to (4,3).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (4,3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a " Zigzag" or "Meandering" path.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "Zigzag" or "Meandering" shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 0 0

Note that this new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and forms the same "Zigzag" or "Meandering" shape with its empty spaces.
