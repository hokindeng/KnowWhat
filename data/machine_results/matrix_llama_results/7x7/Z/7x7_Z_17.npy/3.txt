You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P). Since the coordinates of the top left corner are (0,0), the current player position (P) is at (1,2). I will move to the empty space adjacent to the right, which has the coordinates (1,3).

My next move is to (1,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1,3), my next move will be to the right again to the adjacent empty space. The new coordinates will be (1,4).

My next move is to (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (1,4). My next move will be to the right again to the adjacent empty space. The new coordinates will be (1,5).

My next move is to (1,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1,5), my next move will be down to the adjacent empty space, which seems to be the path towards the goal (G). However, I'll move down first to (2,5) to try to get closer to the goal.

My next move is to (2,5), but since there is a wall (1) at that position, I will re-evaluate my move.

Upon re-evaluation, I'll move to (1,6) instead, as it is an empty space.

My next move is to (1,6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (1,6). Since the goal is below my current position, I need to find a path to move down. However, there's a wall at (2,6), so I'll try to move down and to the left to (2,5), which appears to be an empty space.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2,5), my next move will be down to the adjacent empty space at (3,5), however, that is not possible since (3,5) is not empty. Then my next move will be to the left to the position (2, does not have empty space as well.) then my next move will be  to (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (3,4). Since my goal (G) is at (4,3), I will move down and to the left to get closer to it. However, there is a wall at (4,4), so I will move down and to the left to position (4,3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) L-shape with a connecting corridor.

The corridors in the original maze form an L-shape with a horizontal section at the top and a vertical section on the right, connected by a shorter corridor.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is still recognizable as an L-shape with a connecting corridor.
