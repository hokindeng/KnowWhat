You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P). Since the current position is at coordinates (1,2) (assuming 0-based indexing), my next move will be to the coordinates (1,3), which is an empty space.

So, my next move is to (1,3). Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1,3), I can see that I have several options to move further. Considering the goal position is below me, I'll try to move down to get closer to it. I will move down to the coordinates (2,3).

However, I see that (2,3) is a wall. In that case, I will move down and to the right, to coordinates (2,4), but that is also not possible as it's also a wall. Then I'll try to move down and to the left, to coordinates (2,2), but that's not possible either.

So, I will move down and to the right as much as I can, and that brings me to coordinates (2,5), which is an empty space.


No, I changed my mind, there is an even better move: I will move to the right to the coordinates (1,4). That is also an empty space.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (1,4). Since the goal position (G) is below me, I'll continue to try to move down to get closer to it. I see that the space directly below me, (2,4), is a wall. However, I notice that if I move to the right, I can then move down. I'll make my next move to the right, to coordinates (1,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1,5), I'll try to move down to get closer to the goal (G). I notice that the space directly below me, (2,5), is an empty space! That's perfect. I'll make my next move down to coordinates (2,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2,5). The goal position (G) is below and to the left of me. I'll make my next move down and to the left, to coordinates (3,4), no, that's not possible as it's a wall. I will instead move down to (3,5), no that's also a wall.

I will move to the left to coordinates (2,4), that is an empty space.


Let me think, so that move will not bring me any closer to G.

Wait, I changed my mind: I'll move to the left to (2,4) anyway because moving down from my current position (2,5) isn't possible and if I move more to the left from my current position, it might be a step in the wrong direction.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "**zig-zag tunnel**" or more specifically, a "**staircase shape**".


Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and forms a similar zig-zag tunnel or staircase shape. It's not an identical copy of the original maze, but it maintains the same general shape.
