You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 G 1 1 1 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

First, I'll identify the current player position (P) and the goal position (G). The player is at the 5th column of the 1st row doesn't have the "P", but the second row, 6th column has a 'P'. I assume it is (1,5) since row and column indices start at 0.

The goal position is at (1,1).

My next move would be to move left to the empty space adjacent to the current position. The coordinates of my next move would be (1,4).

Please let me know the updated maze after this move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or an "L-corridor". The empty spaces form an L-shape, providing a path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:
```
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
In this new maze, the L-shape formed by the empty spaces is still recognizable, but the maze is not an identical copy of the original. The player can navigate from the player position (P) to the goal position (G) through the empty spaces.
