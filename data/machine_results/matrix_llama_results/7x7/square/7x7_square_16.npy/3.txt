You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 G 1 1 1 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

First, I locate the current player position 'P' at coordinates (1,5) and the goal position 'G' at coordinates (1,1).

To navigate to the goal position 'G', I will start by moving the player to an adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal. The only viable option for my next move is to move up from the current position. This would place me at coordinates (1,4), which is an empty space.

My next move will be to coordinates (1,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I analyze the empty spaces and find that they form a general shape of a tunnel or a corridor that goes from the bottom to the top, along the left side of the maze, and then an elbow-shaped tunnel from the left to the right. This tunnel then essentially ends in a straight horizontal corridor where the goal 'G' is located. Overall, the general shape of the corridors is somewhat 'L'-shaped.

Here is a new maze with empty spaces forming the same 'L'-shape:


1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 P 1

This new maze meets the criteria: it is not an identical copy of the original, and it maintains a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces, with those empty spaces forming a shape similar to an 'L'.
