You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (2, 3) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (4, 1).

To start solving the maze, we can move the player to an adjacent empty space. Since the player position is at (2, 3), we can move up, down, left, or right. Moving up would put us into a wall, so that's not a viable option. Moving left is also not possible because of a wall. Moving down would put us at coordinates (3, 3), which is an empty space, but it doesn't seem to lead directly to the goal. Moving right would also put us into a wall.

Considering the options, let's move down to coordinates (3, 3). 

Please update the maze to reflect this new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 P 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the player position now at (3, 3), I can see that moving left would be a viable option since there's an empty space at coordinates (3, 2). However, this also doesn't seem to lead directly to the goal.

A better option appears to be moving further down to coordinates (4, 3), but since the goal 'G' is at coordinates (4, 1), I should try to move closer to it.

I'll choose to move left to coordinates (3, 2) and reassess from there.

Please update the maze to reflect this new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape.
