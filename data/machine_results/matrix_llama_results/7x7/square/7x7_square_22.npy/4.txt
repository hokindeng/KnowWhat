You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by analyzing the possible moves from the current player position 'P' at the coordinates (5,3). 

The possible moves from 'P' are up, down, left, and right. Since the positions above and to the left of 'P' are walls, the possible moves are down or right. However, I will choose to move right because it might lead me closer to the goal 'G' and will not put me in a corner where I might get stuck.

My next move would be to the coordinates (5,4).

Please provide the updated maze after the move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze. Since I'm at the coordinates (5,4), my next possible moves are up, down, left, or right. However, the positions below and to the left of 'P' are not desirable because they would put me further away from the goal.

Moving up would bring me closer to the goal, but I'm not sure if I can reach it directly. I'll move up to the coordinates (4,4) to explore further.

Please provide the updated maze after the move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path" because it has a clear bend that resembles an 'L'.

Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
