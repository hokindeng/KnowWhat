You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by analyzing the surroundings of the current player position 'P'. It is currently located at coordinates (5,3).

To move forward, I will choose to go right, as that seems to be the most promising direction towards the goal 'G'. There is an empty space ('0') to the right of 'P' that I can move into.

Therefore, my next move will be to the coordinates (5,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I'm now at coordinates (5,4). Analyzing my surroundings again, I notice that there is an empty space ('0') above me that I can move into, bringing me closer to the goal 'G'.

My next move will be up to the coordinates (4,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path" that connects the starting point 'P' to the goal 'G'.

Here is a new maze with the same size (7x7) and the same L-shape corridor:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 P 0 1 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G', is not an identical copy of the original maze, and features an L-shaped corridor formed by the empty spaces.
