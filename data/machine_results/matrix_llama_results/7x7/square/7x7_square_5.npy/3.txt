You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Currently, I am at the position marked 'P', which is located at coordinates (2, 3). To solve the maze, I need to move towards the goal 'G', avoiding walls and using empty spaces. Since I can move up, down, left, or right, I will choose a direction that brings me closer to the goal.

My next move will be to move left, as there is an empty space in that direction. 

The coordinates of my next move will be (2, 2).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am now at position (2, 2). Since my goal is to move towards the goal 'G', I will explore possible moves that bring me closer to it. 

I can move either left or down. Moving left does not seem to bring me closer to the goal, as there is a wall in that direction that would force me to move up or right. Moving down seems a better option, as it brings me closer to the goal and allows me to maintain the possibility of moving right later.

My next move will be to move down. 

The coordinates of my next move will be (3, 2).

Please update the maze accordingly.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "Inverted U" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same Inverted U shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 P G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an Inverted U shape, similar to the original maze. The path from P to G can be navigated through these empty spaces, and the maze meets all the specified criteria. Note that the positions of P and G have changed compared to the original maze, while maintaining the same general shape of the corridors.
