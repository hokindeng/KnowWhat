You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by identifying the current player position (P) and exploring the surrounding empty spaces. The current position of 'P' is at (2,3).

The next move will be to an adjacent empty space. I can move up, down, left, or right. Since I want to make progress towards the goal, I'll choose to move down to (3,3), but it's blocked by a wall. Instead, I will move right to (2,4), which is an empty space.

The coordinates of my next move are (2,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll continue from my current position at (2,4).

Since my goal is to navigate towards the goal (G) at (5,5), I'll try to move down. However, there's a wall at (3,4), so I'll try to move right instead. There's an empty space at (2,5), so I'll move there.

The coordinates of my next move are (2,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue from my current position at (2,5). Since my goal is to navigate towards the goal (G) at (5,5), I'll try to move down. There's an empty space at (3,5), so I'll move there.

The coordinates of my next move are (3,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue from my current position at (3,5).

Since my goal is to navigate towards the goal (G) at (5,5), I'll try to move down. There's a wall at (4,5), so I'll try to move right, but that would put me outside the maze. I'll try to move left, but I'd hit a wall at (3,4). However, I can move down to (4,5), then, but there is a wall.  I will try again to go down at a different spot. Since I couldn't move down at 5 I will try to move down at 4. The space (4,4) is occupied by a wall, so I will go to (4 doesn't work), let's go to the next column, to the left, the column with the three so I move down at the column with the three (3), so that will be (4,3), but it is occupied by the wall, so I will do, so the next option is to move at column (2), at column 2 there is the free space at (4,2).

The coordinates of my next move are (4,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path with two straight segments".

Here's a new maze with the same size and shape, but with a different layout:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1


This new maze has an L-shaped path with two straight segments, similar to the original maze. However, the position of the walls, player (P), and goal (G) have been rearranged to create a new and distinct maze.
