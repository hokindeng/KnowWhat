You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position right of the current position 'P'. Therefore, my next move will be to the coordinates (2, 3).

Here is the reasoning behind the move:

- Since we are at position (2, 3) which is 'P', the coordinates (2, 2) and (2, 4) are both '0' which are empty spaces.
- Moving up to (1, 3) or down to (3, 3) will hit the wall '1'.
- Therefore, the most logical move is to the right to (2, 4) or left to (2, 2).
- I chose (2, 4) for the next move.

However, since I should answer according to the exact format you provided, the answer would be a simple pair of coordinates.

Please let me know if you'd like me to proceed in a different manner in the future.

Answer: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, my next move will be down to the position (3, 4) but that's not possible since it is a '1' which is a wall. Therefore, I'll move to the position right of the current position 'P'. 

Answer: (2,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.My next move will be down to the position (3, 5). 

Answer: (3,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.My next move will be down to the position (4, 5) but that's not possible since I was in that position before, it has a '0' and we could end in a infinite loop. However my next move will be down to the position (5, 5), it has a '0'. Also we are getting closer to 'G'.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a " Zigzag" or a modified "S-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Note: This new maze has the same size as the original and has a similar zigzag or S-shape formed by the empty spaces, but is not an identical copy.
