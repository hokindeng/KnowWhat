You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (5,5), and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (6,5).

To move towards the goal, I'll analyze the adjacent empty spaces. Since the space above and to the left are walls, and the space below is also a wall, my only valid option is to move to the right.

Therefore, my next move is to the coordinates (5,6).

New player position will be (5,6).

Please update the maze accordingly, and I'll be ready for the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 P
1 1 1 1 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (6,6). The goal is still at coordinates (6,5).

I can see that the space below me is a wall, and the space to the right is out of bounds. But the space above me is empty, and more importantly, the space to the left is also empty, which brings me closer to the goal.

My next move is to the coordinates (6,5).

Please update the maze accordingly.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, a valid path from P to G, and an L-shaped corridor:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 P 0 1 0 1 G
1 1 0 1 0 0 1

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size, a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and the empty spaces form an L-shape.
