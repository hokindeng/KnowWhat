You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since the current player position is 'P' and the goal is 'G', I'll analyze the maze.

My next move will be down.

 Current position: (4, 6)
 Next position: (5, 6)

Please update the maze and let me know the new state!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 P
1 1 1 1 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll analyze the situation.

Since there's a wall to the right, I'll move to the left.

 Current position: (5, 6)
 Next position: (5, 5) then I will go up to (4,5) then continue and move left to (4,4)

However, since you are only allowing one move at a time, I'll choose my next position: (5, 5)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would say that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "narrow horizontal corridor" or, more broadly, a "straight path with a small detour or a short tunnel/duct".

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a narrow horizontal corridor with a small detour, allowing for a valid path from P to G.
