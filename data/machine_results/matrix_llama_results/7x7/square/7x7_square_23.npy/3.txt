You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P. The goal is to reach position G. Since I can move to any empty space adjacent to my current position in the up, down, left, or right direction, I will evaluate my possible moves.

Looking at the maze, my current position P is at coordinates (1, 5). My possible moves are:

- Moving left to coordinates (1, 4), which is an empty space '0'.
- Moving right to coordinates (1, 6), which is an empty space '0'.

However, my objective is to reach the goal position G at coordinates (4, 4). Therefore, I will prioritize moving left to get closer to the goal. 

My next move will be to coordinates (1, 4).

Please update the maze with my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my current position P at coordinates (1, 4) and the goal position G at coordinates (4, 4), I need to find a path to move downwards. 

Looking at the maze, I see that the space directly below me is an empty space '0' at coordinates (2, 4), but it's blocked by walls on both sides. However, I can move down to coordinates (2, 4) and then reassess the situation.

My next move will be to coordinates (2, 4), but I see that it's blocked by walls on both sides, so I would then move down again.

Wait, looking at the maze more closely, I can actually move down twice to get closer to the goal.

Since the space directly below the space below me, at coordinates (3, 4), is also an empty space '0', I will make a two-step plan to move down twice to get closer to the goal.


However, since you want the coordinates of the next move, I will tell you the immediate next step.

My next move will be to coordinates (2, 4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "staircase".

Here is a new maze with the same size, but with a different configuration of walls and empty spaces, while maintaining the staircase shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 P 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1


In this new maze, the empty spaces form a staircase shape, just like in the original maze. However, the positions of the walls and the path from P to G are different.
