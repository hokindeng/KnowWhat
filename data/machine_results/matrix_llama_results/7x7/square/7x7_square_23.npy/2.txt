You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at coordinates (1,5). 

Looking at the adjacent empty spaces, I see that the only possible move is up or left. However, since moving up will block us from reaching the goal due to the wall at (1, 4), I will move left. 

My next move is to (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the current player position at (1,4), I notice that the only possible moves are to the left or to the right and then down to (2,5). However, since moving to the right will just increase the number of moves, I will move left, which might open potential paths to the goal in fewer moves.

My next move is to (1,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the current player position at (1,3), I will move down to (2,3) in order to try to get closer to the goal.

My next move is to (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 P 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the current player position at (2,3), I can see that moving down will get me closer to the goal. 

My next move is to (3,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 P 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the current player position at (3,3), I'm one step closer to the goal, but still blocked by a wall to my right. I will move down to get even closer to the goal.

My next move is to (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 P G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm finally next to the goal. With the current player position at (4,3), my next move is obvious: I will move right to reach the goal.

My next move is to (4,4). This should be the final move to solve the maze!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a "bent rectangle".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
