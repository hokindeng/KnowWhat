You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P. I need to move towards the goal G. I can move to any empty space (0) that is adjacent to my current position. 

My current options are to move left, right, or down. Moving up is not possible because there is a wall (1). 

To make progress towards the goal, I will move down. This means my new position will be the empty space below my current position.

My current position P is at coordinates (1,5). I will move down to the coordinates (2,5). However, this position is blocked by a wall (1). I will move down to the only available empty space at (2,5), which is actually at (2,4). No, I can move down to (3,5).

Wait, that is also blocked. I will move down to coordinates (4,5) no, that's not right, I will move left to (1,4).

My next move is: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P. I need to move towards the goal G. I can move to any empty space (0) that is adjacent to my current position.

My current options are to move left, right, up, or down. However, moving left is not possible because there is a wall (1) and a column of walls to the left of my position, making that direction unfruitful. 

To make progress towards the goal, I will move down. However, that space is available. So, I will move down to the coordinates (2,4), no that's not right, that is actually (3,4) is two spaces down from me and also and further space down from there is blocked. I can move down to the coordinates (2,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "staircase".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 P 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a staircase shape, similar to the original maze. The path from P to G can be navigated through these empty spaces. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it has the same size and shape characteristics.
