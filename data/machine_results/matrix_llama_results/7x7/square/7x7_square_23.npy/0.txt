You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Currently, I am at the position marked by 'P', which appears to be at coordinates (1,5) when considering the top left corner as (0,0).

My next step will be to move down from (1,5) to (2,5). However, I notice that the space at (2,5) is a wall represented by '1', making this move invalid.

Instead, I will move to an adjacent empty space. Considering the maze, the only feasible move from 'P' at (1,5) is to move left to (1,4), as moving right, up, or down would either hit a wall or move out of the maze, none of which are valid options.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I am now at position (1,4) marked by 'P'. I will move down to (2,4), but since there's a wall at (2,4), that is not a valid move.

Considering the available options, I can move right back to (1,5) which is an empty space, or I can move left to (1,3), or I can move up, but moving up is not possible as I started from the second row and moving up would put me out of the maze or into a wall.

The most viable option that brings me closer to the goal 'G' or at least does not move me away from it, is to move left to (1,3).

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (1,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I am now at position (1,3) marked by 'P'. Moving up or right to (1,2) or (1,4) respectively would be feasible, but it seems like I need to move down to progress towards 'G'. However, I notice that moving directly down from (1,3) to (2,3) would put me into a wall, which is not a valid move.

Considering my available options and trying not to move away from 'G', I will choose to move down and right isn't possible, and down is blocked, so I must move right to (1,4).

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I am now at position (1,4) marked by 'P'. As I did before, I need to continue moving towards 'G'.

Moving up would put me away from 'G' and moving right would not make progress towards 'G' since I wouldn't be able to go further right and then down due to the walls at (2,5) and (3,5). I can move left to (1,3), but this does not make progress towards 'G'.

However, the real challenge here is that all of the direct down moves would put me into a wall, which is not valid.

Considering my available options, it seems like the best option is to keep moving down and right when possible, with an initial move to (1,5). Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (1,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I am now at position (1,5) marked by 'P'. My goal 'G' is down from here.

However, I cannot move directly down from (1,5) as (2,5) is a wall. Considering my available options and the need to move down to get closer to 'G', I need to move to a position that would allow me to bypass the wall.

I can move left to (1,4) but I've been there before, or I can move right to (1,6) to see if I can move down from there. 

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (1,6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I am now at position (1,6) marked by 'P'. Moving right isn't possible as it's the edge of the maze and moving up would put me further away from 'G'.

I can move left to (1,5), but that puts me back where I was. My best option is to try moving down.

Since I am at the rightmost column, moving down might be possible now. I will try moving down from (1,6) to (2,6), however there is a wall at (2,6), but if I move down from my current position to (2,6) I would be trying to go into a wall, but from the visuals of the maze I see (2,6) doesn't look empty because (2,5) and (2,6) and other positions below in that column don't form a wall when (2,6) has a zero which signified empty space which can be used to further advance towards G.

Wait no - going down to (2,6) is also actually not viable for going to G, even going further down the column wouldn't assist. After (1,6), using prior mazes I have to actually back track now to function correctly this backtracking of moves I performed a couple of times up until a column empty in this scenarios allows movement to continue.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (1,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've backtracked to (1,5). My goal is still to reach 'G'. Considering my options, moving up or right wouldn't make progress towards 'G', and moving right would put me back in a situation I already analyzed.

I can move left to (1,4) and see if I can find another path down. I'll try to find another column that would allow me to move down and get closer to 'G'.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (1,4). I'll analyze the situation again. Moving up or right wouldn't make progress towards 'G', and moving right would put me in a situation I already analyzed.

I can try to move down, but as I've seen before, there's a wall at (2,4), which blocks my path. However, I also notice that the column to the left, at (x,3), seems to be empty below (1,3), as indicated by the zeros in that column.

Considering this, my next move should be to move left to (1,3) to try to find a way down.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (1,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (1,3). I can try to move down, and I notice that the column at (x,3) is indeed empty below (1,3). I can move down to (2,3), then (3,3), and finally (4,3), which would put me close to 'G'.

Therefore, my next move is to move down to (2,3).

The coordinates of my next move are (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 P 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (2,3). I've moved down from (1,3) to (2,3). My goal 'G' is still below me, and I can see that I can move down from (2,3) to (3,3).

However, as I analyze the maze, I also notice that moving down to (3,3) would put me in a similar situation, and I might not be able to move down from (3,3) to (4,3). But actually there seems to be a path forming to move down, I need to verify.

Considering the available options, I'll move down to (3,3) to try to find a way to reach 'G'.

The coordinates of my next move are (3,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 1 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (3,3). I can see that moving down from (3,3) to (4,3) would put me even closer to 'G'.

Considering the available options, I'll move down to (4,3) to try to reach 'G'.

However, I also notice that there is a wall at (4,4) which is to the right of (4,3), but moving down to (4,3) would give me access to 'G' at (4,4) being the destination isn't exactly the (4,3), G is at (4,4).

The coordinates of my next move are (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (4,3). I've moved down from (3,3) to (4,3). My goal 'G' is now right next to me, at (4,4).

I'll move right to (4,4) to finally reach 'G'!

The coordinates of my next move are (4,4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "inverted L-shape" or a " Gamma shape".

(2) Here is a new maze with empty spaces that form the same shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an "inverted L-shape" or a "Gamma shape".
