You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 P
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. The player's current position is (5, 6), marked by 'P', and the goal position is (1, 0), marked by 'G'. We can move in the up, down, left, or right direction through empty spaces.

Since we want to move towards the goal, a reasonable first move would be to move up from the current position. The space above the player is empty, marked by a '0', so we can move there.

The coordinates of our next move would be (4, 6).

Please update the maze to reflect our new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I can see that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "CIRCLE" or more specifically, a ring or an annulus shape.

Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same shape:


0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 G
0 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 1 P
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0

This new maze has the same size as the original and forms the same general shape with its empty spaces, a circle or ring shape. It also has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The maze is not an identical copy of the original maze.
