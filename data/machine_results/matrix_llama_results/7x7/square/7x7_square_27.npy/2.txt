You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 P
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Currently, I am at the position marked 'P', which is located at coordinates (5, 6). To plan my next move, I will examine the adjacent spaces:

- Up direction: (4, 6) is a wall ('1'), so this move is not possible.
- Down direction: (6, 6) is an empty space ('0'), making it a potential move.
- Left direction: (5, 5) is a wall ('1'), so this move is not possible.
- Right direction: Not applicable since I am already at the rightmost edge of the maze.

Given the constraints, my next move will be down to the empty space at coordinates (6, 6).

Next move: (6, 6)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "outer rectangle" or "outer frame," with the empty spaces forming a rectangular border around the inner walls.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "outer rectangle" shape:


0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 G
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
P 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an "outer rectangle".

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
