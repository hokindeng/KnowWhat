You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 P
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. The player's current position is (5,6) and the goal position is (1,0).

Since the goal position is above the player's current position, our general strategy should be to move up. However, we cannot move up directly because there is a wall (represented by '1') blocking our way.

Our next best option is to move left to (5,5) and then try to find a path to move up. 

So, the coordinates of my next move are (5,5).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I can see that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "Frame" or a "Border".

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "Frame" shape:


0 0 0 0 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 1 P
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0


In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a frame or a border around the walls, but the internal walls are arranged differently to create a new path from P to G.
