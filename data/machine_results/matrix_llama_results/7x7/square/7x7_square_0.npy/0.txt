You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am starting at position 'P', which is located at coordinates (4,2). The goal 'G' is located at coordinates (0,2). To navigate towards the goal without hitting any walls, I should try to move up from my current position, as moving left or right would immediately put me into a wall, and moving down would also lead to a dead end given the structure of the maze.

Thus, my next move will be to the coordinates (3,2), as this is the only adjacent empty space that allows for potential progress towards the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are (3,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 P 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, I am now at position (3,2). To continue navigating towards the goal, I see that moving up would be the best option as it takes me closer to the goal. Moving left or right is not possible due to the walls, and moving down would take me further away from the goal.

My next move will be to the coordinates (2,2), as this is the only adjacent empty space that allows for progress towards the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 P 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I am now at position (2,2). Considering the options, I can see that moving left is not possible due to the wall. Moving down would take me further away from the goal, and moving right is also blocked by a wall. The only viable option is to move up, closer to the goal.

My next move will be to the coordinates (1,2), as this is the only adjacent empty space that allows for progress towards the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 P 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I am now at position (1,2). Since my ultimate goal 'G' is at (0,2) and there is an empty space to my left that coincides with the goal's column, I should take the opportunity to move left towards the goal.

My next move will be to the coordinates (1,1), however, that is a wall and not a valid move. My next available valid move would be directly to the goal at (0,2).

The coordinates of my next move are (0,2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "Vertical Rectangle or Column".


Here is a new maze of the same size that meets the specified criteria:


1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces and maintains a similar shape to the original, with empty spaces forming a Vertical Rectangle or Column. The new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but rather a newly generated one that meets the specified criteria.
