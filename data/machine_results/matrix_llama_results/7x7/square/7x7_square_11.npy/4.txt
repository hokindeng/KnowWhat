You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by identifying the current player position (P) and the goal position (G). The current player position is at coordinates (2,3), and the goal position is at coordinates (4,4).

To move towards the goal, I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces. From the current position (2,3), I can move either left to (2,2) or right to (2,4). Since moving right would lead me directly into a wall, I will choose to move left.

My next move will be to coordinates (2,2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and provide the updated maze for further analysis.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (2,2), I have two available moves: down to (3,2) or right to (2,3).

Since my ultimate goal is to reach the goal position (G) at (4,4), I will choose to move down to (3,2). This move brings me closer to the goal and opens up future possibilities for movement.

My next move will be to coordinates (3,2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 P 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (3,2), I can move left, but that would put me further away from the goal. I can move right, but that would put me directly into a wall. Therefore, I will consider moving down to (4,2).

Since my ultimate goal is to reach the goal position (G) at (4,4), moving down to (4,2) brings me closer to the goal and opens up future possibilities for movement to the right.

My next move will be to coordinates (4,2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 P 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (4,2), I am now closer to the goal position (G) at (4,4). I have two available moves: right to (4,3) or right to (4,4) which is the goal position.

Since I can directly move to the goal position, I will do so.

My next move will be to coordinates (4,4).

Please let me know if I have successfully solved the maze.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner shape". This is because the empty spaces form a continuous path that turns at a right angle, resembling the shape of the letter "L".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
This new maze has the same size as the original, and it features a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces form an L-shape, similar to the original maze. Note that this is not an identical copy of the original maze, but rather a new instance of the same shape.
