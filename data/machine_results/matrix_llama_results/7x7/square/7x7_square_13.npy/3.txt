You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 P 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at 'P', which is located at coordinates (3, 4). My goal is to navigate to the goal position 'G' at coordinates (2, 6).

Since I can only move up, down, left, or right through empty spaces, I will examine the adjacent positions around 'P'.

To the left of 'P', there is a wall ('1') at coordinates (3, 3), so moving left is not an option.

To the right of 'P', there is a wall ('1') at coordinates (3, 5), so moving right is not an option either.

Above 'P', there is a wall ('1') at coordinates (2, 4), so moving up is not an option.

Below 'P', there is an empty space ('0') at coordinates (4, 4). 

Considering the available options, my next move would be to move down to coordinates (4, 4).

Please let me know if this move is valid and provide the updated maze for the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

My current position is at coordinates (4, 4). I'll examine the adjacent positions around me.

To the left of my current position, there is a wall ('1') at coordinates (4, 3), so moving left is not an option.

To the right of my current position, there is an empty space ('0') at coordinates (4, 5).

Above my current position, there is an empty space ('0') at coordinates (3, 4). 

Below my current position, there is a wall ('1') at coordinates (5, 4), so moving down is not an option.

Considering the available options, I'll move to the right to coordinates (4, 5). 

Please let me know if this move is valid and provide the updated maze for the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

My current position is at coordinates (4, 5). I'll examine the adjacent positions around me.

To the left of my current position, there is an empty space ('0') at coordinates (4, 4).

To the right of my current position, there is an empty space ('0') at coordinates (4, 6).

Above my current position, there is a wall ('1') at coordinates (3, 5), so moving up is not an option directly. However, I can move up-left to coordinates (3, 4), which is an empty space.

Below my current position, there is a wall ('1') at coordinates (5, 5), so moving down is not an option.

Considering the available options, I'll move up-left to coordinates (3, 4), and then try to move right towards the goal 'G'. 

However, I'll make an immediate move to coordinates (3, 4) first.

Please let me know if this move is valid and provide the updated maze for the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

My current position is at coordinates (3, 4). I'll examine the adjacent positions around me.

To the left of my current position, there is a wall ('1') at coordinates (3, 3), so moving left is not an option.

To the right of my current position, there is a wall ('1') at coordinates (3, 5), so moving right is not an option directly.

Above my current position, there is a wall ('1') at coordinates (2, 4), so moving up is not an option directly.

Below my current position, there is an empty space ('0') at coordinates (4, 4), which I came from. I can move back down, but that would make no progress.

However, I notice that I can move up-left is not an option, but moving right and up is also not an option, but there is a possibility that if I move right twice I will be next to the goal. So the moves will be right-down then right, if I start the sequence, by moving right-down first by one. 

Considering the available options and goal location, I'll make my immediate move down to coordinates (4, 4) then restart with looking at options in next turn after validating this move. 

Please let me know if this move is valid and provide the updated maze for the next step.

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

My current position is at coordinates (4, 6), but actually I found myself next to the right wall.

Above my current position, I can see there's the goal ('G') at coordinates (2, 6) almost next to me but it's still 2 steps above me,  To get there I should go up twice and will find myself in coordinates (2,6) then done.



Let me put in motion the plan, my first move up and reaching (3,6), this gives me my next position.

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

My current position is at coordinates (3, 6). I'll examine the adjacent positions around me.

Above my current position, I can see there's the goal ('G') at coordinates (2, 6), it's finally next to me.



I will reach the goal by moving up one more time to coordinates (2,6).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "staircase".

Here is a new maze with the same size, but with a different configuration of walls and empty spaces, still forming a staircase shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 G
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
