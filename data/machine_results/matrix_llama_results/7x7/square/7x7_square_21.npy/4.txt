You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (4, 3). My goal is to reach position G (4, 0). Since I can move to any empty space adjacent to my current position in the up, down, left, or right direction, I will examine the available options.

Looking at the maze, I see that moving up is blocked by a wall (1), moving right is also blocked by a wall, and moving down will not get me closer to the goal. Therefore, I will move left to (4, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 G P 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (4, 2). My goal is to reach position G (4, 0). Since I can move to any empty space adjacent to my current position in the up, down, left, or right direction, I will examine the available options.

Looking at the maze, I see that moving up is blocked by a wall and some spaces (with unknown feasibility), moving right will put me back at my previous position, and moving down will not get me closer to the goal. Moving left seems to be the most promising option, as it will bring me closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are (4, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag corridor" or a " serpentine path".

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zig-zag corridor shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 1 1 1
0 P 1 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note that this new maze meets the criteria specified above, with a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a zig-zag corridor or serpentine path.
