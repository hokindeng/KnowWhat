You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 P 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (1,5). To navigate to the goal 'G' at (6,0), I should start by moving upwards towards the empty spaces that can potentially lead me to the goal. The available options for my next move are moving up, left, or right. Moving right is not feasible since there's a wall to the right of my current position. Moving left also doesn't seem to lead directly towards the goal. The most promising direction seems to be moving up.

The coordinates of my next move will be (1,4), moving up from my current position (1,5) to the empty space directly above me. This is the first step towards navigating through the maze to reach the goal 'G'.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "rectangle".

However, considering a more detailed analysis that accounts for the entire path from the player position 'P' to the goal position 'G', the general shape could be described as a combination of two rectangular sections connected by a narrower passageway or corridor. This is evident when considering the empty spaces in the original maze form two distinct areas - a larger rectangle at the top where 'G' is located and a smaller vertical corridor leading to 'P' at the bottom right. Thus, a more precise description might be a "larger rectangle connected to a smaller vertical rectangle or corridor".

For simplicity and in line with the initial assessment, if we were to simplify the shape to a basic geometric form, we would focus on the fact that the main navigable area forms a rectangle. However, acknowledging the complexity and the two distinct sections (a larger rectangle and a narrower vertical corridor), this description captures the essence of the maze's path more accurately.

(2) To create a new maze that meets the specified criteria:

Given the dual nature of the path described, we aim to maintain a larger rectangular section connected to a narrower vertical section in the new maze. Here's an example that adheres to all specified criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze maintains the same size as the original (7x7) and includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces. While it's not an identical copy of the original and retains the recognizable combined rectangular shape of the empty spaces, it rearranges the layout to comply with the task's requirements. The player must navigate from the bottom part of the maze upwards, connecting through a smaller corridor into a larger rectangular section where 'G' is located.
