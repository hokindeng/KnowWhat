You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 P 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (1,5). To navigate to the goal 'G' at (6,0), I should start moving towards the left and then downwards to reach the goal.

My next move would be to move left to the adjacent empty space at coordinates (1,4).

So, my next move is to (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (1,4). Since I am trying to navigate to the goal 'G' at (6,0), my optimal next move would be to move downwards to the adjacent empty space.

However, looking at the maze, I see that there is a wall directly below me. So, my next move should be to continue moving left to the adjacent empty space at coordinates (1,3).

So, my next move is to (1,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1

0 1 1 1 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (1,3). Since I am trying to navigate to the goal 'G' at (6,0), my optimal next move would be to move left again to the adjacent empty space.

My next move would be to coordinates (1,2).

So, my next move is to (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0 0 1

G 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (1,2). Since I am trying to navigate to the goal 'G' at (6,0), my optimal next move would be to move left again to the adjacent empty space.

My next move would be to coordinates (1,1).

So, my next move is to (1,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (1,1). Since I am trying to navigate to the goal 'G' at (6,0), my optimal next move would be to move left again to the adjacent empty space.

My next move would be to coordinates (1,0), but I notice that there is a wall to my left. I must avoid it.

Instead, I can move down. Unfortunately, I see that there is a wall directly below me. However, I also see that there is a path that opens up if I move down at the leftmost column.

I can get to that column by moving up. However, moving up will put me against a wall, which is not beneficial.

Alternatively, I can start moving down on the current rightmost open path. To do this, my next move would be to the right to coordinates (1,2) followed by a move down. Since we are looking for a single move here, I choose not to do this.

However, this above discussion informs us that the best thing would be to move to (0,1), since we can't move to the left.

So the current maze tells us the player is currently not in a position where the above-discussed options could ever be taken.

My next move is to move down, then left to (0,1). However we see again this will require 2 moves not one, therefore this is again not the best option available.

Another possible solution is therefore, move all the way right until you can move down to get to the G-position.

I'll start this by moving to (1,2).

So, my next move is to (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (1,2). Since I decided to move to the right until I can move down, my next move would be to continue moving to the right.

My next move would be to coordinates (1,3).

So, my next move is to (1,3).

I am currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (1,5). Since I am trying to move to the right until I can move down, I notice that I am currently blocked by a wall to the right. However, I also see that there is an opening below me at coordinates (2,5).

My next move would be to coordinates (2,5), starting my journey downwards.

So, my next move is to (2,5).

I am currently at the position 'P' which is at coordinates (2,5). Since I started moving downwards, my goal is to continue moving down until I reach the goal 'G'. However, I notice that I am currently blocked by a wall below me. I also see that there is an opening to the left at coordinates (2,4).

My next move would be to coordinates (2,4), moving left to try to find a path downwards.

So, my next move is to (2,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path with two perpendicular segments".

Here is a new maze with the same size and shape of empty spaces:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
G 1 1 1 1 0 1

This new maze has the same L-shape corridors and meets the specified criteria. Note that the new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but the shape of the empty spaces is still recognizable as an L-shape.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
