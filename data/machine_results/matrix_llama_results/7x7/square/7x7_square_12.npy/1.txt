You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 P 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (1, 5). To find a path to the goal position G (6, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

There is only one adjacent empty space to my current position, which is the space directly to the left at coordinates (1, 4). 

Therefore, my next move will be to position (1, 4).

Please update the maze and let me know if this is a valid move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

I am currently at position P (1, 4). To find a path to the goal position G (6, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

There are two adjacent empty spaces to my current position: 

1. The space directly to the left at coordinates (1, 3).
2. The space directly to the right at coordinates (1, 5), but I was just there and going back won't help me reach the goal.

To progress, I will choose to move to the left at coordinates (1, 3).

Therefore, my next move will be to position (1, 3).

Please update the maze and let me know if this is a valid move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

G 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

I am currently at position P (1, 3). To find a path to the goal position G (6, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

There are two adjacent empty spaces to my current position: 

1. The space directly to the left at coordinates (1, 2).
2. The space directly to the left at coordinates (1, 2) seems like the best move because there's a wall of 1s below me.

Therefore, my next move will be to position (1, 2).

Please update the maze and let me know if this is a valid move.

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

I am currently at position P (1, 2). To find a path to the goal position G (6, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

There are two adjacent empty spaces to my current position: 

1. The space directly to the left at coordinates (1, 1).
2. The space directly to the left at coordinates (1, 1) seems like the best move because it could allow me to move down if there is a open path in the future or I could move to (1,0) and attempt to move down.

Therefore, my next move will be to position (1, 1).

Please update the maze and let me know if this is a valid move.

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

I am currently at position P (1, 1). To find a path to the goal position G (6, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

There is one adjacent empty space to my current position: 

1. The space directly to the left at coordinates (1, 0).

Moving to (1, 0) is the best option, as it will allow me to move down the maze if there is an open path in the future.

Therefore, my next move will be to position (1, 0).

Please update the maze and let me know if this is a valid move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

G 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

I am currently at position P (0, 0 isn't correct, position P should be at (1,0)). To find a path to the goal position G (6, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

There is one adjacent empty space that will lead me closer to my goal position below my current position: 

None of the spaces are available below me, but I will examine the availability below these occupied spaces. 

Looking ahead at the column, none of the spaces are empty below position (2,0) through (5,0), but the column adjacent to this column has empty spaces. To progress down, I will attempt to get to this column.

The empty space directly to the right at coordinates (1, 1) is the only available option.

Therefore, my next move will be to position (1, 1).

Please update the maze and let me know if this is a valid move

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back to this position.

I am currently at position P (1, 1). To find a path to the goal position G (6, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

There is one adjacent empty space to my current position that I will attempt to utilize later: 

1. The space directly to the right at coordinates (1, 2), but I was just at this space, I can try to move further right, (1, 5), (1,4), or (1, 3), but I won't go further to the right than (1,3).

I will attempt to get to column 3 because none of the spaces are empty below position (2,0) through (5,0), but the column adjacent to the second column has a space that is empty below a certain row.

My next move will be to position (1, 3).

However, considering my plan, after I've moved to (1,3), I might have to move back to a prior column, so the moves I'm doing now aren't going directly toward the goal but may open a pathway to it.

Please update the maze and let me know if this is a valid move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "inverted L" shape.

However, looking closer at it and knowing the goal of making it to position G at (6,0), it can also resemble a type of 
  
"C shape" or reverse 

  C

depending on perspective
