You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Currently, I am at the position marked 'P', which is located at coordinates (1, 6). The adjacent empty spaces are (1, 5) to the left and potentially others in the up, down, or right directions, but these would involve moving into a wall, which is not allowed. Therefore, the only valid move from the current position is left.

So, my next move will be to the coordinates (1, 5). 

Please update the maze to reflect this move and present the new state of the maze for further analysis.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

Currently, I am at the position marked 'P', which is located at coordinates (1, 5). The adjacent empty spaces are (1, 4) to the left, and (1, 6) to the right. Moving up or down would involve moving into a wall.

Since my goal is to reach the goal position 'G', which is located at coordinates (3, 6), I need to make progress in that direction. To do so, I should try to move down or right, but since moving down is not an option due to the wall, my best choice is to move right.

However, moving right to (1, 6) would only bring me back to the previous position. So, I should consider moving left instead to create space to move down in the future. 

My next move will be to the coordinates (1, 4).

Please update the maze to reflect this move and present the new state of the maze for further analysis.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

Currently, I am at the position marked 'P', which is located at coordinates (1, 4). The adjacent empty spaces are (2, 4) below me, (1, 5) to the right, and none to the left, as that would involve moving into a wall.

Since my goal is to reach the goal position 'G', which is located at coordinates (3, 6), I need to make progress in the downward direction. 

My next move will be to the coordinates (2, 4) to move down and get closer to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

Currently, I am at the position marked 'P', which is located at coordinates (2, 4). The adjacent empty spaces are (2, 5) is blocked by a wall to the right, (3, 4) below me, (2, 3) to the left is blocked by a wall, but none of the above options would get me closer to the goal immediately except moving down.

However, if I move down immediately I would not be able to progress to the right from that point. Therefore I should instead try to move around the wall to the right.

To do this I need to move left and then around to get past the wall to the right of the current position.

However since there are no empty spaces available to the left the best option for me is to move down then left to create some space and options.

So, my next move will be to the coordinates (3, 4) and then I will be able to move left.

Currently, I am at the position marked 'P', which is located at coordinates (3, 4). The adjacent empty spaces are (3, 5) to the right, which is closer to the goal 'G'.

Since the goal is within immediate reach, I can make the next move directly towards it.

My next move will be to the coordinates (3, 5).

Please let me know if this move is correct and I have solved the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag" or a " diagonal stair".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a diagonal stair shape, similar to the original maze. The maze has the same size as the original, and there is a valid path from P to G that can be reached through the empty spaces. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it shares the same general shape formed by its empty spaces.
