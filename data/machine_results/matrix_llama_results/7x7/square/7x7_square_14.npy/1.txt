You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 P 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (4, 2).

From this position, I have the following possible moves:

- Up: (4, 1) is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
- Down: (4, 3) is an empty space (0), so it's a valid move.
- Left: (3, 2) is an empty space (0), so it's a valid move.
- Right: (5, 2) is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.

Considering the goal position (G) is at coordinates (6, 1), I will choose the left move to get closer to the goal position while keeping the possibility of moving down later.

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (P) at coordinates (3, 3), I have the following possible moves:

- Up: (3, 2) is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move (since I just came from the right, the actual wall is above where I started).
- Down: (3, 4) is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
- Left: (2, 3) is a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.
- Right: (4, 3) is an empty space (0), so it's a valid move.

Considering the goal position (G) is at coordinates (6, 1) and the available moves, I will choose the right move to get further towards the right, with the intention of moving up later.

The coordinates of my next move are (4, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) The shape of the path is a variant of a "staircase" or a series of connected "L" shapes.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 0 0 P 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and forms a similar "staircase" or connected "L" shapes with its corridors.
