You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 P 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Currently, I am at the position marked 'P', which is (4,2). The goal position 'G' is at (6,2). 

My possible moves are:
* Up: blocked by a wall
* Down: blocked by a wall
* Left: blocked by a wall
* Right: empty space at (4,3)

However, since there's a wall at (4,3) as well in the given maze, we can actually move to the position (5,2).

Therefore, my next move is to the position (5,2).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (5,2).

Please update the maze with my new position, and I'll be happy to provide the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am now at position (5,2). 

My possible moves are:
* Up: blocked by a wall
* Down: empty space at (6,2) ( Goal position, But we will move there later in our last move)
* Left: blocked by a wall
* Right: blocked by a wall

However, since there's an empty space at (6 is going to be our last move, let's try position 5,1).

No, since there's a wall at (5,1) as well in the given maze, we can actually move to the position (5,3).

However since there is a wall at 5,3 as well, we see position 4,3 is empty in the 4th row which is (3,3).

However that is not our best move, hence we have a move left so we can go down and move right twice hence my next move is down so,

The coordinates of my next move are (6,2).

NO my next move is going down not correct lets go left and move P up next turn my correct current next coordinates of the move are going to be,

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I can conclude that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is an "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 G 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form an L-shape, and there is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces. Note that this is not an identical copy of the original maze, but rather a new maze with the same general shape formed by the empty spaces.
