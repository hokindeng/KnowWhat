You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'd be happy to help solve the maze.

The current player position is at (1, 2). To find the next move, I will analyze the adjacent positions:

* Up: (0, 2) - wall (1)
* Down: (2, 2) - empty space (0)
* Left: (1, 1) - wall (1)
* Right: (1, 3) - empty space (0)

My next move will be to the right, to position (1, 3).

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (1, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll analyze the adjacent positions:

* Up: (0, 3) - wall (1)
* Down: (2, 3) - wall (1)
* Left: (1, 2) - empty space (0), but I was already there
* Right: (1, 4) - empty space (0)

My next move will be to the right, to position (1, 4).

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll analyze the adjacent positions:

* Up: (0, 4) - wall (1)
* Down: (2, 4) - empty space (0)
* Left: (1, 3) - empty space (0), but I was already there
* Right: (1, 5) - wall (1)

My next move will be down, to position (2, 4).

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll analyze the adjacent positions:

* Up: (1, 4) - empty space (0), but I was already there
* Down: (3, 4) - empty space (0)
* Left: (2, 3) - wall (1)
* Right: (2, 5) - wall (1)

My next move will be down, to position (3, 4).

However, I notice that the goal (G) is at position (3, 1), which is to the left of my current position. I'll need to get there eventually. Since I'm moving down, I'll aim to get closer to the goal in my next move.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 G 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting close to the goal!

With the updated maze, I'll analyze the adjacent positions:

* Up: (2, 4) - empty space (0), but I was already there
* Down: (4, 4) - wall (1)
* Left: (3, 3) - empty space (0)
* Right: (3, 5) - wall (1)

My next move will be to the left, to position (3, 3).

However, I notice that the goal (G) is at position (3, 1), which is even further to the left. I'll need to get there eventually.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Almost there!

With the updated maze, I'll analyze the adjacent positions:

* Up: (2, 3) - wall (1)
* Down: (4, 3) - wall (1)
* Left: (3, 2) - goal (G)
* Right: (3, 4) - empty space (0), but I was already there

My next move will be to the left, to position (3, 2), where the goal is!

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (3, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Fun task!

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a winding or bent "L-shape" (or "L-path"), connecting the starting point (P) to the goal (G).

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming the same L-shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze meets the criteria: same size, valid path from P to G, not identical to the original maze, and the general shape of the empty spaces is an L-shape.
