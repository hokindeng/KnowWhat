You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position right of the current position 'P'. My new position will be (1,3).

Please note that I'm assuming the coordinates are in the format (row, column), where the top-left corner is (0,0).

My next move will be to the position (1,3), which is currently a '0' (empty space).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the position below the current position 'P'. My new position will be (2,3).

However, I see that the position (2,3) is occupied by a '1' (wall), so I will move to the position (1,4), which is currently a '0' (empty space).

My next move will be to the position (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the position below the current position 'P'. My new position will be (2,4).

However, I see that the position (2,4) is a '0' (empty space), so I will move to that position.

My next move will be to the position (2,4), and then I will try to get closer to the goal 'G'.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the position left of the current position 'P'. My new position will be (2,3).

However, I see that the position (2,3) is a '1' (wall), so I will move to the position above the current position is also a wall, and the position to the right is also a wall. So I will move to the position (3,3), but first, I must go back to the position (2,4) then go right is also a wall. Then move to the position (1,4), I can move to the left 3 times to reach the 'G' in fewer moves.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the position left of the current position 'P'. My new position will be (1,3).

My next move will be to the position (1,3), and then I will try to get closer to the goal 'G'.

So, my next move will be to the position (1,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the position left of the current position 'P'. My new position will be (1,2).

My next move will be to the position (1,2).

Note that I'm getting closer to the top-left corner, but eventually, I will try to find a way to move down to the goal 'G'.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the position down of the current position 'P'. My new position will be (2,2).

My next move will be to the position (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 P 1 0 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the position down of the current position 'P'. My new position will be (3,2).

My next move will be to the position (3,2). 

Note that this move will put me at the same row as the goal 'G', which I'm trying to reach.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag path" or a "meandering corridor".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zig-zag path:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note that this new maze has a different configuration of walls and empty spaces, but the overall shape of the path from P to G is still a zig-zag path.
