You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 G 0 P 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at the bottom row, and the goal is to its left.

Since we can move in the up, down, left, or right direction, the possible moves from the current position are:

* Up: Not possible (wall)
* Down: Not possible (out of bounds)
* Left: Possible (empty space)
* Right: Not possible (wall)

Considering the possible moves, I'll choose to move left. The new coordinates of the player position will be the same row and one column to the left.

The current player position is at (6, 4), so the new coordinates will be (6, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

Next move coordinates: (6, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 G P 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the updated maze. The current player position is at (6, 3), and the goal is still to its left.

Since we can move in the up, down, left, or right direction, the possible moves from the current position are:

* Up: Not possible (wall)
* Down: Not possible (out of bounds)
* Left: Possible (goal position)
* Right: Possible (empty space)

Considering the possible moves, I'll choose to move left, which will put me at the goal position. However, if I move left, I'll reach the goal, and the game will be over. But if I move right, I might get stuck, so I'll choose to move left and try to win the game.

The current player position is at (6, 3), so the new coordinates will be (6, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

Next move coordinates: (6, 2)

(Note: If I'm correct, this should be the final move, and the game should be won.)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A straight corridor or a rectangular tunnel with a small detour or bend.

To create a new maze with the same shape, I'll generate a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces that form a similar rectangular tunnel with a small detour. Here is the new maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 G 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a rectangular tunnel with a small detour, similar to the original maze. The player starts at position P and needs to navigate through the tunnel to reach the goal G.
