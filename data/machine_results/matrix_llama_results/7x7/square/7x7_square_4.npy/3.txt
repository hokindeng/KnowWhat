You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 P 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (1, 3), and the goal position is at (2, 1). 

Since I can only move up, down, left, or right through empty spaces, I will evaluate these options:

- Moving up from (1, 3) is not possible as there is a wall.
- Moving down from (1, 3) is possible as there is an empty space at (2, 3).
- Moving left from (1, 3) is not possible as there is a wall.
- Moving right from (1, 3) is not possible as there is a wall.

Given the constraints, my next move would be to go down from (1, 3) to (2, 3).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 G 0 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

I'm currently at position (2, 3), and the goal position is at (2, 1).

Considering the possible moves:

- Moving up from (2, 3) is not possible as there is a wall above.
- Moving down from (2, 3) is not possible as there is a wall below.
- Moving left from (2, 3) is possible as there is an empty space at (2, 2).
- Moving right from (2, 3) is not possible as there is a wall to the right.

Given the options, my next move would be to go left from (2, 3) to (2, 2).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 G P 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll plan my next move.

I'm currently at position (2, 2), and the goal position is at (2, 1), right next to me.

Considering the possible moves:

- Moving up from (2, 2) is not possible as there is a wall above.
- Moving down from (2, 2) is not possible as there is a wall below.
- Moving left from (2, 2) is possible as there is the goal position at (2, 1).
- Moving right from (2, 2) is possible as there is an empty space at (2, 3), but that would move me away from the goal.

Given the options, my next move would be to go left from (2, 2) to (2, 1), which is the goal position.

So, the coordinates of my next move are (2, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "zigzag" or "L-shape".

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 P 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and its empty spaces form a zigzag or L-shape. Note that the orientation and position of the shape are different from the original maze.
