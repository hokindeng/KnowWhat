You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 P 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'd be happy to help solve the maze.

After analyzing the maze, I see that the current player position (P) is at (2,3) and the goal position (G) is at (2,1).

My next move would be to move up from the current position, which would put me at coordinates (1,3). However, I see that there is a wall at (1,3), so I will move left instead.

My next move would be to move left from the current position, which would put me at coordinates (2,2).

So, my answer is: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 G P 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I see that I'm now at coordinates (2,2).

My goal is still to move towards the goal position (G) at (2,1). Since I'm right next to it, my next move would be to move left again, which would put me at coordinates (2,1).

So, my answer is: (2,1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would say that:

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is an "L-shape".

The L-shape is formed by the empty spaces in the top-left corner and the vertical corridor that leads to the goal (G).

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it forms the same L-shape with its empty spaces, and there is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces.
