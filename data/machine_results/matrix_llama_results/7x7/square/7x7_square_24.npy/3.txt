You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 P 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. The current player position is at (1,4) marked as 'P', and the goal position is at (0,6) marked as 'G'.

The maze looks like this:

1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 P 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

The adjacent empty spaces to the current player position are (1,3) (blocked by a wall) and (1,5) (blocked by a wall). However, the space directly above the current player position, at (0,4), is empty.

The next move should be to move up to the empty space at coordinates (0,4).

Please let me know the outcome of this move, and I will continue solving the maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 P 0 G
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm glad I was able to move up successfully. Now that I'm at (0,4), my next move should be to the right to get closer to the goal. The space to the right of my current position, at (0,5), is empty.

My next move should be to move right to the empty space at coordinates (0,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 0 P G
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (0,5). The goal is at (0,6), which is just to the right of my current position. My next move should be to move right to the goal space at coordinates (0,6).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, where the empty spaces form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but the empty spaces still form an L-shape that allows for a valid path from P to G.
