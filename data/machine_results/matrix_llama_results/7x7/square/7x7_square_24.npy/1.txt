You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 P 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I see that the current player position (P) is at coordinates (1,4). My objective is to navigate towards the goal position (G) at coordinates (0,6).

First, I will examine the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position (1,4). I can move either left, right, up, or down. 

Moving up to (0,4) is not possible because there is a wall.
Moving down to (2,4) is not possible because there is a wall.
Moving left to (1,3) is not possible because there is a wall.
Moving right to (1,5) is possible.

Considering the available options, I will make the following move:

Next move: (1,5)

Please provide the updated maze after making this move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is an "L" shape, which also resembles a corner.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form a similar "L" shape:

1 1 1 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces, which still form an "L" shape, but with a different configuration than the original maze.
