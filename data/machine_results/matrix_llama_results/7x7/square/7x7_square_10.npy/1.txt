You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 G 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 P
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since we can only move up, down, left, or right, we'll evaluate each option.

The current player position is at the bottom row, and the goal position is at the top row. To reach the goal, we need to move up. However, there is a wall directly above the current position. We need to find an alternative path.

Looking at the maze, we can see that there is an empty space to the left of the current position. This could be a possible path. Let's move left.

The coordinates of the next move are (4, 5).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "S-shape" or a curved path.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size, encoding, and shape:

1 G 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 P
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note that this new maze has a curved path (S-shape) connecting the start position (P) to the goal position (G), while avoiding walls. The path is not identical to the original maze, but maintains the same shape and characteristics.
