You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P).

My current position is at (3,0) since indexing starts at 0. To move right, my new position will be (3,1).

The coordinates of my next move are (3,1).

Please update the maze and provide it again for my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3,1), I want to move right again to explore further.

The coordinates of my next move are (3,2).

Please update the maze and provide it again for my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

0 0 P 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (3,2). To make progress, I'll move down to (4,2) to explore the possibilities below.

The coordinates of my next move are (4,2).

Please update the maze and provide it again for my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 P 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4,2), I'm blocked by a wall to the left and can't go further down due to another wall. I'll move to the right isn't an option either. However I can move left and up but that would not advance me. My decision is to move left.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path", with the path going from the top-left to the bottom-left and then to the right.

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the path from P to G forms the same L-shape as in the original maze, but the actual path and the positions of the walls are different.
