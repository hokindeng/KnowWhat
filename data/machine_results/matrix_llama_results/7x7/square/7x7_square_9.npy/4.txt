You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at (3,0), and the goal 'G' is at (5,0). Since there is an empty space directly below 'P', a valid move would be to move down.

My next move is to coordinates (4,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1 1 1
P 1 0 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (4,0). The goal is still at (5,0). However, there's a wall directly to my right, so I need to navigate around it. I see an empty space directly to my left.

My next move is to coordinates (4,1) is not possible because there's a wall, so I'll move left to coordinates (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at position (3,0). Now I see an empty space directly to my right.

My next move is to coordinates (3,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (3,1). The goal 'G' is still below me. I need to continue moving down to get closer to the goal. There is an empty space directly below me.

My next move is to coordinates (4,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L-shape" or an "L-corridor".

This shape is characterized by two straight sections of empty spaces that meet at a 90-degree angle, forming an "L" shape.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape, with the vertical section being the corridor from (2,1) to (4,1) and the horizontal section being the corridor from (4,1) to (4,4) and then to (5,4). The maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, and there is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces.
