You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 G 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. To start, I need to identify the current position of 'P'. In the given maze, 'P' is located at (2,2).

Next, I'll consider all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from 'P' and choose an empty space ('0') as my next step.

From (2,2), I can move:
- Up: Not possible because it's out of bounds of the provided coordinates.
- Down: Possible to (3,2), but it's better to move left or right first to avoid potential dead ends.
- Left: Possible to (2,1).
- Right: Blocked by a wall ('1').

My next move will be left to (2,1).

Please confirm the move and update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 G 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll plan my next move from my current position 'P' at (2,1).

From (2,1), I can move:
- Up: Not possible because of the wall above.
- Down: Possible to (3,1), but it might limit my future options.
- Left: Not possible because of the wall to the left (out of bounds of the provided coordinates, but we know there is a wall because it's the boundary).
- Right: Possible to (2,2), but it's better to explore other directions first.

My next move will be down to (3,1).

Please confirm the move and update the maze accordingly.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or "L-corridor." This shape is formed by two connected segments that turn 90 degrees to create an L-like pattern.


Here's a new maze with the same size, and the empty spaces form an L-shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same L-shape pattern in its corridors and has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces.
