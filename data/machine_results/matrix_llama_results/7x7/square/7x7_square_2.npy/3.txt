You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 1 1 P
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To start solving the maze, I will first identify the current player position (P) and the goal position (G).

The current player position is at the coordinates (5,6), and the goal position is at the coordinates (5,3).

My first move would be to move up from the current player position to the adjacent empty space. Therefore, my next move will be to the coordinates (5,5).

The new maze after my move will be:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please let me know if my move is correct or if I need to make any adjustments. 

Next Move Coordinates: (5,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will plan my next move based on the updated maze.


Current player position (P) is at the coordinates (6,5), and the goal position (G) is at the coordinates (5,3).


Since the goal position is above and to the left of my current position, and there is an empty space adjacent to my current position on the left, my next move will be to the coordinates (6,4).


The maze will be updated accordingly after my move. 


Please let me know if my move is correct or if I need to make any adjustments.


Next Move Coordinates: (6,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a zigzag shape or an "L" shape with two 90-degree turns.


(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and the same shape of empty spaces:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1 1 1


This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size, a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is also recognizable as a zigzag shape or an "L" shape with two 90-degree turns.
