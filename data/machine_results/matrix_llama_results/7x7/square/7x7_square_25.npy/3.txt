You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move. 

From the current position 'P' (1,3) I can move in two directions: up or right (to coordinates (1,2) or (1,4) respectively). However, moving right will result in hitting the wall. Therefore, I choose to move up to the coordinates (1,2).

My next move is to the coordinates (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

From the current position 'P' (1,2), I can move in three directions: up, down, or left (to coordinates (0,2), (2,2), or (1,1) respectively). Moving up will result in hitting the wall. Moving left is a valid move. However, I want to make progress towards the goal 'G' which is below my current position. Therefore, I choose to move down to the coordinates (2,2) but it is blocked by a wall. Instead, I will move left to coordinates (1,1).

My next move is to the coordinates (1,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

From the current position 'P' (1,1), I can move in two directions: right or down (to coordinates (1,2) or (2,1) respectively). Moving right will take me back to the position I was in two moves ago, which doesn't help me make progress. Therefore, I choose to move down to the coordinates (2,1).

My next move is to the coordinates (2,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

From the current position 'P' (2,1), I can move in two directions: left or right, however, both directions will put me into the position that is further from the goal. Instead,  I choose to not move left or right and look at other options. Moving up will also result in moving away from the goal. The only direction left is moving down to the coordinates (3,1), and as a result, be closer to the goal.

My next move is to the coordinates (3,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

I'm getting close to the goal. From the current position 'P' (3,1), I can see that the goal 'G' is to my right. I can move right to the coordinates (3,2), however, I can also move directly to the goal if I move two steps to the right. I will move one step to the right for now.

My next move is to the coordinates (3,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 P G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

The goal 'G' is now just one step to the right of my current position 'P' (3,2). I can move directly to the goal by going one step to the right.

My next move is to the coordinates (3,3). This move should put me at the goal 'G'.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L-shape" or "corner shape", as the path from P to G consists of two perpendicular segments that form a 90-degree angle.

To generate a new maze that meets the criteria, I present the following:

(2) New maze:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 G 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and its empty spaces form an "L-shape" or "corner shape" similar to the original.
