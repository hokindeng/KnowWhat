You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P).

My current position is (2, 3) since we start counting from 0.

I will move one step to the right, which would put me at position (2, 4). However, that position is a wall. 

So, my next move will be one step up, which would put me at position (1, 3). 

However, again I see that I can move left, so I should move one step to the left which would put me at position (1, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are (1, 2).

Please update the maze accordingly and present it to me again. 

I will then make the next move.

So, the final answer is (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

My current position is (1, 2). 

I'll move down to get closer to the goal position. 

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 2).

Wait, there is a wall at (2,2), I will get stuck if I move down, hence I should move left. The coordinates of my next move are (1,1).

Please update the maze accordingly and present it to me again.

The final answer is (1,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

My current position is (1, 1). 

I see that moving down to (2, 1) is a viable option to get closer to the goal. 

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 1).

Please update the maze accordingly and present it to me again.

The final answer is (2,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

My current position is (2, 1). 

I need to navigate around the wall to my right, so I'll move down to (3, 1). 

However, (3,1) is not the optimal position since we will be adjacent to another wall, a much more optimal position is to move to (2,0) if it is empty. However (2,0) is not empty hence my only option now is the right most cell of the current cell that is (2,2) however this cell also has a wall so my next move is move down.

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 1).

However the optimal move to make was to move to (2,0) if the (2,0) is empty and (2,0)  is actually empty 

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape that can be traversed from the starting point (P) to the goal point (G). The maze is not identical to the original, but the shape of the corridors is recognizable as an L-shape.
