You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. I am currently at position P, which is located at (5,2) in the maze. My goal G is at (3,4).

To reach my goal, I need to move up and to the right. However, there is a wall directly above me, so I will need to find a way around it. Looking at the maze, I see that I can move diagonally up and to the right to get closer to my goal.

My next move will be to the position (4,3). This position is an empty space (0), so it is a valid move.

The coordinates of my next move are: (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I am now at position P, which is located at (4,2).

My next goal is to continue moving towards the goal G, which is at (3,4). Since I can move diagonally, I will try to move diagonally up and to the right again.

However, this time I see that I can move up to the empty space (0) that is directly above me.

My next move will be to the position (3,2). This position is an empty space (0), so it is a valid move.

The coordinates of my next move are: (3,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting close to the goal!

Based on the updated maze, I am now at position P, which is located at (3,2). My goal G is still at (3,4).

Since I am already at the same row as the goal, I will try to move horizontally to the right to get closer to the goal.

My next move will be to the position (3,3). However, I see that this position is a wall (1), so it is not a valid move.

Instead, I will move diagonally up and to the right, but since I'm already at the topmost available row, I will simply move diagonally to the right and slightly down to position (3,3 doesn't work so I'll choose) (4 doesn't work, lets check (3 is not an option I'll do) 3 4 no) ( no good) 
 move right one space from (3,2) right one - wall no move to 3 4 minus one space 3 3 "NO"

AG response

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a zigzag path or an "S" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size as the original, and a new path that forms a similar zigzag or "S" shape:
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
This maze meets the criteria:

* It has the same size as the original maze (7x7).
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces.
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze.
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an "S" shape or zigzag path.
