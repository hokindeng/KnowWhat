You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at (5,2). The goal position 'G' is at (3,4). 

We need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and using empty spaces. Since we can move diagonally, I'll opt for a diagonal move towards the goal. 

My next move would be to the position (4,3), which is an empty space and closer to the goal.

Please update the maze with the new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (4,3). Now I need to move closer to the goal 'G' again. Since I can move diagonally, I'll aim for another diagonal move.

My next move would be to the position (3,4), but that's not possible since it's the goal and I need to approach it through an empty space. So, I'll move to the empty space (3,2) to get closer to the goal.

However, upon reviewing the maze, I see that (3,2) isn't empty. Instead, I can move up to the empty space at (3,2) isn't available, but (3,1) isn't available either. I'll opt to move to the empty space (4,2).

No, that doesn't help me out much. Let me try something else.

My next move would be to the position (3 doesn't work, 4,2 isn't a good approach, so) (4,4). That should get me closer to the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path" since it has a 90-degree turn that allows navigation from the player position to the goal.

Here's a new maze with the same size (7x7) and the same shape of corridors (L-shape):

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 G
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has an L-shaped path that connects the player position 'P' to the goal position 'G' through empty spaces, while maintaining the same size and encoding as the original maze.
