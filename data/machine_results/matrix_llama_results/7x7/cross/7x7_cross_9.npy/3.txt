You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P). I can move to the empty space above, below, to the left, or to the right of the player position, as long as it's not a wall.

The player's current position is P(3,4). Since the maze is 0-indexed, this means the player is in the 4th row and the 5th column.

Looking at the maze, the next available move would be to move up to the empty space at (2,4). However, this space is not directly above the player; instead, I can move diagonally up-left to the empty space at (2,3). This will be my next move.

So, the coordinates of my next move would be (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P).

I can move to the empty space above or to the left of the player position, as long as it's not a wall.

Looking at the maze, I see that the next available move would be to move up to the empty space at (1,2). This is not directly above the player, but the player can move diagonally up-left to this position is not possible in this particular move, so I will move to the empty space (1,2) first moving left to (2,2) then up, this will be done in 2 moves but for now the coordinates of my next move would be (2,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag path" or a "winding stair".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zig-zag path:

1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The path is not identical to the original maze, but the general shape formed by its empty spaces is still a zig-zag path or winding stair.
