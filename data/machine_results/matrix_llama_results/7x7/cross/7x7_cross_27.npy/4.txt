You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at (1,3) and the goal position is at (1,1).

Since I can move to any adjacent empty space, I'll look for the available options. From the current position (1,3), I can move down to (2,3) or left to (1,2). Moving up is not an option since there's a wall. Moving right is also not an option since there's a wall. Moving diagonally up-left is an option, and that would take me to the goal position (1,2) is not the goal, but (1,1) is.

However, since I can move diagonally, I'll choose to move diagonally up-left to (1,2) and then reassess my options.

My next move would be to (1,2).

Please update the maze accordingly.

(And if I'm lucky, I might be able to move diagonally up-left again to reach the goal position (1,1)!)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "Inverted L" shape, which can also be described as an "L" shape with its corner at the top-right.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape of corridors (an Inverted L shape), encoded in the same format as the original:

0 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the corridors form an Inverted L shape, and there is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces. Note that this maze is not identical to the original, but it shares the same size and shape of corridors.
