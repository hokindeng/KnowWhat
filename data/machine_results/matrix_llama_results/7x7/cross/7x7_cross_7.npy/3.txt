You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. I am currently at position P, which is located at (4,2) if we consider the top-left corner as (0,0).

To move towards the goal G, which is at (2,2), I need to go up. However, since diagonal moves are allowed, I can directly move diagonally up-left to (3,1) to avoid hitting the wall directly above me. This position is currently marked as '0', indicating it is an empty space, making it a valid move.

My next move will be to (3,1).

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3,1), marked as P, my next goal is to continue moving towards G.

I can see that there is a wall directly above me at (2,1) and also to the right at (3,2). However, there is an empty space diagonally up-right at (2,2), which is the goal G itself.

Since I can move diagonally, my next move will be directly to the goal at (2,2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a diagonal line or a zigzag pattern, which is effectively a diagonal corridor.

To generate a new maze that meets the criteria:

(1) The name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a **Diagonal Corridor**.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces that form the same general shape as a diagonal corridor:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and has a similar diagonal corridor shape formed by the empty spaces. It is not an identical copy of the original maze, but shares the same general shape characteristics.
