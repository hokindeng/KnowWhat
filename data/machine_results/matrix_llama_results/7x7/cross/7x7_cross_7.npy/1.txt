You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To start, I need to identify the current position of 'P' and any adjacent empty spaces. 'P' is located at coordinates (4,2), according to the 0-based indexing of the grid. There is an adjacent empty space at coordinates (3,1).

My next move will be to the empty space at coordinates (3,1). 

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze. My current position 'P' is at coordinates (3,1). To move towards the goal 'G', I notice that there is an adjacent empty space at coordinates (2,0) that I can move to.

My next move will be to the empty space at coordinates (2,0).

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at coordinates (2,0), I notice that I'm right next to the goal 'G'. I can move diagonally up and to the right to reach the goal.

My next move will be to the goal 'G' at coordinates (2,2).

Please confirm if I've reached the goal!

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path". This shape is formed by two perpendicular corridors that connect to form a 90-degree angle.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape that connects the starting position 'P' to the goal 'G'. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it has the same size and shape characteristics.
