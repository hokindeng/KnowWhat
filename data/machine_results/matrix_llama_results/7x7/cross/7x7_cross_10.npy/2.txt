You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (5,5). The goal is at position G (3,3). To navigate to the goal, I need to move up and left.

Since there is a wall directly above and directly to the left of my current position, I will move diagonally up and left to avoid the walls.

My next move will be to the position (4,4).

Please update the maze with my new position, and I will analyze it again for the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I'm now at position (4,4) as 'P'. I still need to navigate to the goal 'G' at position (3,3).

Since I'm close to the goal, I can move directly up to reach the goal or move diagonally up-left. To be more precise, I'll choose the direct up movement.

My next move will be to the position (3,4).

Please update the maze with my new position, and I'll analyze it again for the next move if needed.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(distorted) Staircase" shape, specifically a staircase with a Z-like or zigzag pattern. 

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a staircase shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a staircase shape that allows the player to move from the start position 'P' to the goal position 'G'.
