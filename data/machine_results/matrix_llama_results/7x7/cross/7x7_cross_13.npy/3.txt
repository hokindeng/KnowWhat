You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at coordinates (1,4) and the goal is at (1,6).

To navigate towards the goal, we can move diagonally to an empty space adjacent to the current position. The most direct path towards the goal without hitting the wall would be to move diagonally down and right.

However, the first step should be to move to an empty space. The closest empty space is at (2,5). Moving directly there in one step is not possible without going through the wall, but we can set the target for our first move to be (2,5).

Therefore, our first move should be towards (2,5). Since we can move diagonally down and right from our current position (1,4) to (2,5), we will do so.

The coordinates of my next move are (2,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We have moved to (2,5) and now we need to plan our next step.

To get closer to the goal, we need to move up. However, if we move directly up, we will hit the wall at (1,5). We need to create an opportunity to reach the goal without hitting the wall. Since we can move diagonally, let's move diagonally up and left to the empty space at (1,4).

However, (1,4) was our original position and moving there would put us back where we started. This would be inefficient, so we should look for an alternative.

Let's re-examine the maze. Another option for moving up without hitting the wall is to move up and right to the goal itself, but that is not possible in the next move because it is blocked by the wall.

Considering our options, we should aim to get as close to the goal as possible while avoiding walls. Given the available empty spaces, we can move to (3,5). However, this move is directly down and doesn't bring us closer to the goal, so let's look for another option.

Moving diagonally up and right to the goal directly is not an option in one step due to the wall. Since the goal is at coordinates (1,6), let's examine what's below it, at coordinates (2,6), and below that at (3,6). We find a wall at (2,6), but (2,6) is next to the goal and right above an empty space at (3,6) and our current position at (2,5) has an empty space below it.

Since we can move to (3,5) but that doesn't help us reach the goal, we need to find another way. Let's move down to (3,5), which we'll use as an intermediate position before heading back up towards the goal ultimately.

Therefore, our next move should be to position (3,5).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path" since it has a clear diagonal shortcut and forms a distinctive corner-like path from the start to the goal.

Here is a new maze of the same size that meets the criteria:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has an L-shaped corridor of empty spaces, allowing for a valid path from P to G. It's not an identical copy of the original maze, but it maintains the same overall shape and structure.
