You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position
The current player position is represented by 'P' and is located at coordinates (1, 4) in the given maze.

## Step 2: Identify the goal position
The goal position is represented by 'G' and is located at coordinates (1, 6) in the given maze.

## Step 3: Examine the adjacent spaces to the current player position
Looking at the maze, the spaces adjacent to 'P' (1, 4) are examined:
- Up: (0, 4) is a wall '1'.
- Down: (2, 4) is a wall '1'.
- Left: (1, 3) is a wall '1'.
- Right: (1, 5) is a wall '1'.
- Up-left: (0, 3) is a wall '1'.
- Up-right: (0, 5) is a wall '1'.
- Down-left: (2, 3) is a wall '1'.
- Down-right: (2, 5) is an empty space '0'.

## Step 4: Choose a valid move
Based on step 3, the only valid move from the current position is down-right to (2, 5).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  5\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position
The current player position is represented by 'P' and is now located at coordinates (2, 5) in the updated maze.

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal position remains at coordinates (1, 6) in the maze.

## Step 3: Examine the adjacent spaces to the current player position
Looking at the maze from the new position of 'P' (2, 5), the adjacent spaces are:
- Up: (1, 5) is a wall '1'.
- Down: (3, 5) is a wall '1'.
- Left: (2, 4) is a wall '1'.
- Right: (2, 6) is a wall '1'.
- Up-left: (1, 4) is an empty space '0'.
- Up-right: (1, 6) is the goal position 'G'.
- Down-left: (3, 4) is a wall '1'.
- Down-right: (3, 6) is a wall '1'.

## Step 4: Choose a valid move towards the goal
From the current position, the most direct valid move towards the goal is moving up-right to (1, 6), which is the goal position 'G'. However, realizing the mistake in calculation due to the format restrictions and reevaluating the proper format for movement - since direct access to 'G' involves moving through a wall and realizing the error in calculation, the correct step involves actually moving to an accessible position that's misinterpreted in the step-by-step logic provided.

## Step 5: Correcting the mistake in step 4 and adhering strictly to the format given for the answer but acknowledging the need for diagonal movement to a viable space:
Upon reviewing the steps for adherence to format and re-evaluating based on campaign restrictions and requirements for steps, acknowledge the need to select an accessible movement option given the layout and adhering strictly to the guidance provided in the instruction for response format:

Given the error in calculation and direct goal move in step 4, revisiting and determining the immediate feasible next steps would typically align with selecting a viable available space that is directly accessible which would more logically have aligned with the space identified as up and to the left in the correct interpretation for step-by-step advancement, thus would correct the pathing to analyze suitable accessible options.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a diagonal path from the top-right to the bottom-left of the maze, albeit not a perfect straight line, it can be generalized as forming a shape that resembles a diagonal line with variations to accommodate the maze structure.

## Step 2: Name the general shape
Given the path's resemblance to a diagonal line with slight variations, the shape could be generalized as a "Diagonal Line with Offshoots" or more creatively, a "Staircase" due to its stepped nature.

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same size and shape of empty spaces
Given the constraints, a new maze must be created with the same 7x7 size, including a 'P' for the player's start position, 'G' for the goal, '1' for walls, and '0' for empty spaces that form a similar "Staircase" shape.

## Step 4: Design the new maze
Ensuring the new maze is not an identical copy but retains the "Staircase" shape, here is a new 7x7 maze:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 G
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze maintains the "Staircase" shape of empty spaces, allows for a valid path from 'P' to 'G', and meets all other criteria.

The final answer is:


1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 G
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
