You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at coordinates (1,4) and the goal is at (1,6).

To navigate towards the goal, we can move diagonally to an empty space adjacent to the current position. The most direct path towards the goal without hitting the wall would be to move diagonally down and right.

However, the first step should be to move to an empty space. The closest empty space is at (2,5). Moving directly there in one step is not possible without going through the wall, but we can set the target for our first move to be (2,5).

Therefore, our first move should be towards (2,5). Since we can move diagonally down and right from our current position (1,4) to (2,5), we will do so.

The coordinates of my next move are (2,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We have moved to (2,5) and now we need to continue towards the goal.

To get closer to the goal, we need to move up. Since we are at (2,5), moving directly up to (1,5) would put us into a wall, which we need to avoid. However, there is an empty space at (1,4) that we can use as an intermediate step.

Our goal is to move up towards the goal, and (2,5) to (1,4) brings us closer. However, considering our possible moves from (2,5), a diagonal move up and left would put us in a better position to approach the goal.

So, we'll move up and left diagonally from (2,5) to (1,4).

The coordinates of my next move are (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We are back at (1,4). Now that we've moved back to this position, let's analyze our possibilities again.

Our goal is at (1,6). To get closer to the goal, we need to move right. We can't move directly to (1,6) because of the wall at (1,5), but we can try to move to an empty space that gets us closer to the goal.

We already know that there is an empty space at (2,5). We also know that there is a wall between our current position and the goal.

Considering the maze structure, we see that there is an empty space at (2,5) and another at (3,5), which are below our current position. Moving down to (2,5) brings us to a familiar position, but this time, we'll have an opportunity to explore further.

Our next move should be down to (2,5) again.

The coordinates of my next move are (2,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We are back at (2,5) again.

Now, let's think about our next step. Since we're trying to get to the goal at (1,6), we need to find a way to get closer to it. Moving up directly is blocked by the wall, and we've already explored moving left. So, our next option is to explore the empty space below us.

There is an empty space at (3,5), and another at (3,6), which could potentially bring us closer to the goal.

Moving down to (3,5) seems like a reasonable next step.

The coordinates of my next move are (3,5).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L-shape" or " corner shape", as the empty spaces form a corridor that makes a sharp turn.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze is the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape or corner shape.
