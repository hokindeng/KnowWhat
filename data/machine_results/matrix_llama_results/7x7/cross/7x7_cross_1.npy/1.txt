You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the empty space adjacent to the player position.

Current position: (6, 1) (P)
Goal position: (6, 3) (G)

I will move to the empty space at (5, 2), which is diagonally up-right from the current position.

New position: (5, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the empty space adjacent to the player position.

Current position: (5, 2) (P)
Goal position: (6, 3) (G)

I will move to the empty space at (6, 1).

New position: (6, 1)

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back to the starting position!

Current position: (6, 1) (P)
Goal position: (6, 3) (G)

I will move to the empty space at (5, 1), which is directly up from the current position.

New position: (5, 1)

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a "bent tunnel".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 P 1 0 G 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form an L-shape, but the path from P to G is slightly different. Note that this is not an identical copy of the original maze, but rather a new maze with the same general shape.
