You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position (P). It seems the only empty space adjacent to P is directly above it. Therefore, I will choose to move up.

The current position of P is (4,2). I will move to (3,2).

Please let me know if this move is valid and update the maze accordingly.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze appears to be a spiral or a zig-zag path that traverses the maze from the top-left to the bottom-left.

However, upon closer inspection, I would argue that the general shape is more accurately described as an "S-shape" or a "sigmoid curve". The path starts from the top, moves down, then turns and moves up, and finally turns again to move down to the goal.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size as the original, but with a different layout that still forms an S-shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
P 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces in this maze form an S-shape, which is recognizable as the same general shape as the original maze.
