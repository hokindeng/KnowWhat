You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (4, 2).

Here are the possible moves and their corresponding coordinates:

- Moving up: (3, 2) - blocked by a wall
- Moving down: (5, 2) - blocked by a wall
- Moving left: (4, 1) - blocked by a wall
- Moving right: (4, 3) - blocked by a wall
- Moving up-left: (3, 1) - blocked by a wall
- Moving up-right: (3, 3) - blocked by a wall
- Moving down-left: (5, 1) - empty space
- Moving down-right: (5, 3) - blocked by a wall

Considering the available options, my next move would be to move down-left to coordinates (5, 1).

So, my next move is to (5, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the possible moves from the current position.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (5, 1).

Here are the possible moves and their corresponding coordinates:

- Moving up: (4, 1) - empty space
- Moving down: (6, 1) - goal position, but I'll explore other options as well
- Moving left: (5, 0) - blocked by a wall
- Moving right: (5, 2) - blocked by a wall
- Moving up-left: (4, 0) - blocked by a wall
- Moving up-right: (4, 2) - empty space
- Moving down-left: (6, 0) - blocked by a wall
- Moving down-right: (6, 2) - blocked by a wall

Considering the available options, I can move up to coordinates (4, 1) or try to move towards the goal. However, I'll choose to move up to (4, 1) to explore the maze further and see if there are any other paths.

So, my next move is to (4, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "S-shape" or a "sigmoid curve."

Here is a new maze with the same size as the original, with empty spaces that form a similar S-shape:
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
G 1 1 0 1 1 1
```
Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it maintains a similar S-shape in its corridors, allowing for a valid path from P to G.
