You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves to reach the goal position 'G'. To start, I am at position 'P', which is at coordinates (4, 3).

My first move will be up and to the left, aiming to get closer to 'G' diagonally. However, since I can only move to an empty space ('0'), I will move to the space directly left of 'P' first, as moving diagonally up-left is blocked by a wall.

The coordinates of my next move will be (4, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze appears to be an 'L' shape. The path from 'P' to 'G' involves moving upwards and then turning right (or moving to the right and then turning upwards), resembling an L-shaped corridor.

2. Here's a new maze with the same size (7x7) and an L-shaped corridor formed by the empty spaces:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the L-shaped corridor is vertical first and then horizontal, and the path from 'P' to 'G' can be navigated through the empty spaces. This new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it maintains the same size and the recognizable L shape.
