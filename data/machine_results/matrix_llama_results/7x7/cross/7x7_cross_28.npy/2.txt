You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves. To start, I need to identify the current player position 'P' and the goal position 'G'. The positions are as follows:

- P is at (4, 4)
- G is at (2, 2)

Given the constraints and the goal, my first move will be to move the player to an adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal. Since I can move diagonally and I am aiming to reach the goal 'G', my next move should be one step towards reducing the distance between P and G while avoiding walls.

From the current position (4, 4), I can see an empty space diagonally up-left, which brings me closer to the goal 'G'. Therefore, my next move's coordinates would be to move to (3, 3).

However, since the task requires strict adherence to format and the exact question wasn't replicated in the answer but rather incorporated into a more free-form response, I must adjust my response to fit your strict format requirements, which seems to demand the answer box alone without contextual setup. Given this constraint:

$oxed{(3,3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I've moved to (3, 3) and become aware of the updated maze with 'P' now at that position, the next step involves analyzing the new local environment. Seeing the maze, the goal 'G' is closer now, and there's an empty space directly above 'P' that would bring me even closer to 'G'. 

Considering the direct path towards 'G', my next move would logically be to move up to the empty space that is closer to 'G'. However, upon reviewing the maze again, the direct up move would actually place me into a wall (1), which is not permissible. Given the rules of movement (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), I notice a diagonal move up-left towards 'G' is possible, but my prior statement about direct movement was incorrect due to oversight of the wall's presence. A diagonal or any move towards 'G' while avoiding walls is ideal.

Correcting my strategy: Given the position of 'P' and the goal 'G', my logical next step, considering the rules and the need to approach 'G' while avoiding walls, actually would be to move diagonally if a direct move towards 'G' is not possible without hitting a wall. But considering the updated maze configuration:

Upon careful reevaluation, noticing 'P' is at (3,3) and considering all possible moves, I realize the error in proposing a direct path due to wall presence and recognize that a careful inspection of the updated maze actually reveals that a diagonal move towards the goal without hitting a wall isn't directly available from (3,3) to the goal's vicinity without navigating through the available '0' spaces more strategically.

Thus, a more strategic approach involves evaluating all possible moves (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) from (3,3), avoiding walls (1), and moving through empty spaces (0) closer to (2,2). But, as the direct to 'G' method contains an error in logic application due to the wall and my constraint of strictly answering in the specified format restricts further elucidation within this textual explanation, I will directly address the best calculated move without specific indication in this instance:

$oxed{(2,3)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze appears to be an 'L' shape or a corner shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size that meets the criteria and forms an 'L' shape with its empty spaces:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces (represented by '0') form an 'L' shape that connects the start position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. This maze is not an identical copy of the original maze but retains the same general shape with its corridors.
