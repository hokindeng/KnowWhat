You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves. To start, I need to identify the current player position 'P' and the goal position 'G'. 

After analyzing the maze, I find that the goal 'G' is at coordinates (2, 3) and the current player position 'P' is at coordinates (4, 4).

Given the rules of movement (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal) and the current state of the maze, my next move will be diagonal up-left towards the empty space at coordinates (3, 3).

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I see that I am now at coordinates (3, 3).

My objective is still to reach the goal position 'G' at coordinates (2, 3). I notice that there's an empty space at coordinates (2, 4) that I could move to, but since I'm trying to reach the goal 'G' directly, I will instead move up to the goal position 'G' if possible.

However, considering the restrictions, my next move will be up towards the goal position. The coordinates of my next move are (2, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a diagonal path.

Here's a new maze with the same size, a valid path from P to G, and a diagonal path formed by the empty spaces:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 G 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze but retains the same diagonal path shape formed by the empty spaces.
