You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 G 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves step by step.

First, let's locate the player position and the goal position in the maze:

- Player position 'P' is at coordinates (2, 1).
- Goal position 'G' is at coordinates (0, 1).

Given the initial maze configuration, my first move will be to the empty space directly above the player position. This space is diagonally up and to the left from 'P' and directly up is blocked by a wall.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move will be (1, 0), moving diagonally is not possible in this case, so I will move left first then up, but I will provide the next feasible move:

Move to (2, 0).

This move is necessary as it sets up a path towards the goal while avoiding the wall directly above the starting position. After this move, the updated maze will reflect the new position of 'P'.

Please update the maze with 'P' in position (2, 0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze appears to be an 'L' shape (or a 90-degree angle), considering the arrangement of empty spaces that allow movement from the player position to the goal.

(2) Here is a new maze that meets the specified criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze is the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and forms an 'L' shape with its corridors, while not being an identical copy of the original maze.
