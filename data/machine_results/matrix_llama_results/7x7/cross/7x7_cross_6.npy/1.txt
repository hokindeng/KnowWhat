You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 G 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'd be happy to help solve the maze.

Based on the given maze, I'll start by identifying the current player position (P) and the goal position (G).

Current player position (P): (2,1)
Goal position (G): (0,1)

To plan my next move, I'll analyze the adjacent empty spaces. Since I can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), I'll explore the options.

The available adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up-left: (1,0) - Not accessible (wall)
- Up: (1,1) - Not accessible (wall)
- Up-right: (1,2) - Accessible (empty space)
- Right: (2,2) - Not accessible (wall)
- Down-right: (3,2) - Not accessible (wall)
- Down: (3,1) - Not accessible (wall)
- Down-left: (3,0) - Not accessible (wall)
- Left: (2,0) - Not accessible (wall)

Considering the available options, my next move would be to the up-right adjacent empty space, which is at coordinates (1,2).

Please update the maze accordingly, and I'll be ready to plan my next move.

Next move coordinates: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 G 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved to the new position (1,2), I'll analyze the adjacent empty spaces.

Current position (P): (1,2)
Goal position (G): (0,1)

The available adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up-left: (0,1) - Accessible (goal position)
- Up: (0,2) - Not accessible (wall)
- Up-right: (0,3) - Not accessible (wall)
- Right: (1,3) - Not accessible (wall)
- Down-right: (2,3) - Not accessible (wall)
- Down: (2,2) - Not accessible (wall)
- Down-left: (2,1) - Accessible (empty space), but moving away from goal
- Left: (1,1) - Not accessible (wall)

Considering the available options, my next move would be to the up-left adjacent empty space, which is at coordinates (0,1), and it's actually the goal position!

Next move coordinates: (0,1)

Please update the maze, and I'll verify if I've reached the goal successfully.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L" shape

The "L" shape is formed by the two connected segments of empty spaces: one vertical segment (initial position to the up-right move) and one horizontal segment (leading to the goal position).

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "L" shape:

1 G 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an "L" shape that connects the initial position (P) to the goal position (G). Note that the exact path and the positions of the walls have been changed, but the overall shape remains the same.
