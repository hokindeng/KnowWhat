You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my first move.

First, I need to identify my current position (P) and the goal position (G). From the maze, I can see that the current player position 'P' is at coordinates (2,4), and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (2,2).

My first move should be towards the goal while avoiding walls. Given that I can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), I'll prioritize moving closer to the goal in a way that doesn't put me in a difficult position for the next moves.

A good first move would be to move diagonally up and left to the coordinates (1,3). However, since that space is a wall ('1'), I'll choose the next best option. I can move left to the empty space at coordinates (2,3).

Therefore, my first move will be to the position (2,3).

Please update the maze accordingly.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze appears to be a vertical corridor with a couple of small branches that are, however, blocked by the position of 'P' and 'G', giving the appearance of an "L" shape when accounting for only accessible, valid paths.

(2) Below is a new maze that has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces, is not identical to the original, and maintains an "L" shaped corridor for its empty spaces:

1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 1 1 G
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
