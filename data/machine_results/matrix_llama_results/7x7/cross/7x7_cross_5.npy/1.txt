You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 P
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To start solving the maze, I first need to identify the current position of the player 'P' and the goal 'G'. In the provided maze:

- The goal 'G' is located at coordinates (3,4).
- The player 'P' is located at coordinates (5,5).

My strategy will be to move towards the goal in the most direct path possible while avoiding walls. Given the current position and the goal, a direct path involves moving diagonally when possible.

Since I can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals), my next move will be diagonally up and left towards the goal, aiming to reduce the distance in both the x and y coordinates. 

Therefore, my next move from (5,5) would ideally be to (4,4). However, I need to ensure this space is empty or, if not directly possible, choose the closest available empty space in the general direction of the goal.

Given the maze layout:

- Moving directly to (4,4) is not possible as it is occupied by a wall (1). 
- Therefore, the most direct alternative move towards the goal would be to move to (5,4), as it is the closest empty space that gets me closer to the goal while navigating around the wall.

So, my next move is to the coordinates (5,4).

Note: I acknowledge the move doesn't change the x coordinate but improves the y position towards the goal, navigating the constraints of the maze provided.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "staircase" or more specifically, a zigzag path that resembles a "right-angled Z shape" or "stair-step shape". However, for simplicity, we can refer to the shape formed by the corridors as a "Zigzag" or "Staircase".

2. Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same "Zigzag" or "Staircase" shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 P
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze but includes a valid path from P to G that follows a zigzag or staircase pattern, recognizing the constraints and rules given in the problem statement.
