You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to my current position, I'll choose a move that brings me closer to the goal position. I'll move diagonally down and to the right. 

My current position is (3,1), and I'll move to (4,2). 

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and present it to me again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I've moved to (4,2), I'll aim to move closer to the goal. I can see a clear path by moving down. 

My current position is (4,2), and I'll move down to (5,2). 

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and present it to me again.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a "bent path".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and forms an L-shape with its corridors. It is not an identical copy of the original maze.
