You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 P 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since I can move to any adjacent empty space, including diagonals, I'll try to get closer to the goal.

My current position is (0, 4) marked by 'P'. The goal position is (2, 4) marked by 'G'.

For my next move, I'll try to move down and left to position (1, 3). However, since I can only move to empty spaces (marked by '0'), I'll instead move down to (1, 4), which is an empty space.

My next move will be to (1, 4).

Please update the maze with my new position and let me know if it's correct or not.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L-shape" or " corner shape", as the empty spaces form a long vertical corridor that connects to a shorter horizontal corridor, resembling an L-shaped path.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:
```
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
Note that this new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and features an L-shaped corridor formed by the empty spaces.
