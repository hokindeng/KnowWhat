You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves. Since I can move to any adjacent empty space (including diagonals), I will explore all options.

The current player position is at (1,1). Analyzing the surrounding spaces:

- Up: (0,1) has a wall (1).
- Up-left: (0,0) has an empty space (0).
- Left: (1,0) has a wall (1).
- Down-left: (2,0) has a wall (1).
- Down: (2,1) has a wall (1).
- Down-right: (2,2) has an empty space (0).
- Right: (1,2) has a wall (1).
- Up-right: (0,2) has a wall (1).

The only valid moves from the current position (1,1) are up-left to (0,0) or down-right to (2,2). I will choose to move to (2,2) because it seems to be a more direct path to the goal. 

Therefore, my next move is to position (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves. The current player position is at (2,2).

Analyzing the surrounding spaces:

- Up: (1,2) has a wall (1).
- Up-left: (1,1) has an empty space (0).
- Left: (2,1) has a wall (1).
- Down-left: (3,1) has a wall (1).
- Down: (3,2) has a wall (1).
- Down-right: (3,3) has an empty space (0).
- Right: (2,3) has a wall (1).
- Up-right: (1,3) has a wall (1).

The only valid moves from the current position (2,2) are up-left to (1,1) or down-right to (3,3). Since I came from (1,1) previously, I will choose to move to (3,3) to explore a new area.

However, I will plan ahead and notice that after moving to (3,3), the only possible next move would be to (4,3), and from there I can only move back to (3,3). This path does not seem to lead anywhere, and I would need to backtrack to (2,2).

Instead of moving to (3,3), I will consider moving to (4,2) directly, as it seems like it could potentially connect to other parts of the maze.

Wait, the space (4,2) is empty! I didn't consider it as I was being conservative with diagonal moves. 

My next move is to position (4,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) an "hourglass" shape.

Now, I will generate a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "hourglass" shape. Here is the new maze:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 P 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 G 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form an "hourglass" shape, connecting the starting point (P) to the goal (G) through a valid path. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it meets all the required criteria.
