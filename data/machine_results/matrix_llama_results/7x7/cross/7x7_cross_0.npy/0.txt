You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the surroundings of the current player position 'P'. It is currently at position (1, 1), with the goal 'G' located at (5, 1). I can see that there is an empty space at (2, 2), which is diagonally adjacent to the current position.

My next move would be to the coordinates (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I can see that my current position 'P' is at (2, 2) and the goal 'G' is still at (5, 1). I need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls.

I notice that there is an empty space at (2, 3). However, moving there would not bring me closer to the goal. Instead, I can move to the coordinates (3, 2), which would put me closer to the goal.

My next move would be to the coordinates (3, 2), but that space is a wall. I will need to move around it.

My next move would be to the coordinates (2, 3) isn't good, so I will move to (2,1).

My next move would be to the coordinates (2, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "S-shape" or a "zigzag path".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same S-shape or zigzag path:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 P 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a zigzag path from the top-left to the bottom-left, similar to the original maze. However, the exact configuration of the walls and empty spaces is different, making it a distinct maze with the same general shape.
