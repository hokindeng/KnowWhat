You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 G 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (5, 3) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (0, 3). 

To start, I'll try to move up towards the goal. Since I can only move to an empty space, my next move would be to the position directly above the current position, which is (4, 3). 

However, I should also consider the possibility of moving left or right to find an alternative path. After examining the maze, I think moving up is the most promising direction for now.

My next move would be to coordinates (4, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "Vertical Column". The empty spaces form a vertical corridor that connects the starting position 'P' to the goal position 'G'.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "Vertical Column" shape:


1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 1 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a vertical column that connects the starting position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape and structure.
