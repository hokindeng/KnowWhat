You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 P
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G', my first move would be to go left, as moving up is blocked by walls, moving right is also blocked by a wall, and moving down leads out of the maze, which doesn't help in reaching the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to the position (5, 5) since the current position 'P' is at (5, 6) assuming that the top left corner is (0, 0). 

Move: (5, 5)

Please update the maze with my new position and let me proceed with the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 G P 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, my next move would be up, but since there are walls blocking the direct path up to 'G', I would aim to move around the walls by going left first. However, since my current left position is blocked by 'G', which is the goal, and it's not an empty space I can move into before actually reaching it as a goal, I need to reconsider. Given that my left is 'G' and I am aiming for it indirectly, moving directly up is blocked, and my right is open and could allow me to find a path around the walls, my next move is actually to the right to find a potential path up.

However, since moving directly up to the goal 'G' is the objective and moving into the goal directly from the current position might not follow the "moving only through empty spaces" instruction strictly (considering 'G' as not an empty space but the goal), and the direct up path is blocked for a straightforward approach, my next move should consider navigating through empty spaces effectively.

To follow instructions precisely, my next move, considering logical approach corrections, is actually to move up towards 'G' if we consider the nature of 'G' being the end goal and this step being a direct path in a game context or scenario permitting direct goal access. However, the instruction to move only through "empty spaces" indicates moving to 'G' directly might not align, yet, considering typical maze rules and direct access being the apparent way forward, one might directly approach 'G'. The critical oversight here was initially treating 'G' as an impassable point, but in reaching the goal directly, moving up is logical for winning the maze game or reaching the end.

Given the clarification that my next move involves considering the rules and aim of reaching 'G', the approach involves actually considering 'G' as an accessible space when it comes to the end goal directly adjacent.

Correcting my temporary confusion: The logical approach in maze-solving is not strictly thwarted by 'G' as an obstruction but as the destination, suggesting my actual logical move is indeed moving to the goal if directly accessible or finding the closest path which is up.

Correct Move: (4, 5)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze appears to be a simplified form of a "**right-angled L-shape**" or more broadly, part of a "**corner or an L-path**" given the specific corridors provided in the problem statement.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with the empty spaces forming a similar right-angled L-shape:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G P
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

This new maze is not an identical copy of the original, maintains the same size, includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces, and the empty spaces form a similar L-shape as the original.
