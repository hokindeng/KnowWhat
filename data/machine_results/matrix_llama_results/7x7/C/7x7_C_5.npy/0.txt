You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 P
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (6,5). The goal is at position G (5,4). I am right next to the goal, but I need to move around the 1's (walls) to get there.

My next move would be to move up to the empty space at (5,5).

The coordinates of my next move are (5,5).

Please update the maze to reflect this move, and I will provide the next step based on the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 G P 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (5,5), I notice that I'm right next to the goal at (5,4). However, since I can only move through empty spaces, I will move left to position (5,4) to reach the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are (5,4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L-shape" or " Corner shape"

The empty spaces in the original maze form an L-shape, with a horizontal corridor at the top-right and a vertical corridor at the bottom-left.

Here is a new maze with the same size and shape, but with a different configuration:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 P 0 1 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form an L-shape, but the position of the corridors and the walls has been changed. The start position (P) and the goal position (G) are also in different locations.
