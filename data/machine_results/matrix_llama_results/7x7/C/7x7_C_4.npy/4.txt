You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position 'P' located at coordinates (2, 1). My goal 'G' is at coordinates (0, 4). 

Since my current position is on the second row and surrounded by walls, I can only move to the empty space on the left. Therefore, I will move to the empty space at coordinates (2, 0). However, considering the structure of the maze and the need to approach the goal, I need to get out of the second row. The only available option is to move to the empty space above me when I reach a position that allows it.

To do so, I will move left on the third row until I can move upwards to the second row. Then, I will be able to move up and get closer to the goal.

Hence, my next move will be to coordinates (2, 0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I can conclude that:

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a "**bottleneck**" or a "**narrow passageway**". The empty spaces form a narrow path that connects the start (P) to the goal (G), with a wider area in the middle and narrow paths at the top and bottom.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same bottleneck shape:


1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a bottleneck or narrow passageway, similar to the original maze. Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but rather a new instance with the same shape characteristics.
