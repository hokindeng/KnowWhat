You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (3, 3). The goal position 'G' is at coordinates (1, 3).

To move closer to the goal, we need to go up. Since the space above 'P' is a wall, we need to go around it. We can move to the right to coordinates (3, 4) and then move up.

My next move is to coordinates (3, 4).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I'll plan the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (3, 4).

Since the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (1, 3), and there is an empty space above my current position at coordinates (2, 4) that is blocked by a wall to the left at coordinates (2, 3), I'll need to move up to coordinates (2, 4) and then find a way to move left.

My next move is to coordinates (2, 4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "zigzag" or "staircase" shape.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1


In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a zigzag shape, but the path from P to G is different from the original maze.
