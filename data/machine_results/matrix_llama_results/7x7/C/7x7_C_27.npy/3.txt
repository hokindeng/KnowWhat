You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since we're at position 'P' and we want to get to 'G', let's first find the coordinates of these positions.

The current player position 'P' is at (3, 3) and the goal position 'G' is at (1, 3).

To move towards the goal, we can move up from the current position. 

The coordinates of the next move would be (2, 3), since moving up decreases the row index.

Please update the maze according to this move, and I'll plan the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved up to (2, 3) and the maze has been updated accordingly.

The next move would be to move up again, to get closer to the goal position 'G'. 

The coordinates of the next move would be (1, 3).

Let me know the updated maze after this move!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would say that the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a "Rectangle".

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a rectangular shape, similar to the original maze. The player can navigate from 'P' to 'G' by moving through the empty spaces within the rectangle.
