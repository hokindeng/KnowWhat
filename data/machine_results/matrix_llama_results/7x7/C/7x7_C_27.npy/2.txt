You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by finding the coordinates of the current player position (P) and the goal position (G). The player position is at (3,3) and the goal position is at (1,3).

To navigate from the player position to the goal position, I will move the player to the empty space above it, which has coordinates (2,3).

My next move is to (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2,3). Since my ultimate goal is to reach the goal position (G) at (1,3), I will move the player up again to the empty space at (1,3). However, since the goal position is already occupied by 'G', I will move to the space next to it, which is (1,4) or (1,2), whichever is empty.

After examining the maze, I see that (1,2) is not empty, but (1,4) is empty. So, my next move is to (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G P 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1,4), I notice that the goal position (G) is to my left at (1,3). Since I'm already in the same row as the goal, I will simply move left to the goal position.

My next move is to (1,3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner shape" that connects the player position to the goal position.

Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
