You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P).

My current position is (1, 4), and I will move to (1, 5).

My next move coordinates are: (1, 5)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and let me know the updated maze so that I can plan my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move down to the empty space below my current position.

My current position is (1, 5), and I will move to (2, 5).

However, the maze shows that the space at (2, 5) is blocked by a wall (1). Instead, I will move down to the empty space at (2, 4) is also blocked, so I will move down to (3, 4), then I can move to (3, 5). But it is also blocked. Therefore I can move to (2,4), then (3,4) then (4,4), which has a 'G' below. My goal is to move down. Since the position below me has a wall that cannot be traversed I will move left to the column that has a 'G'. My current position is (1,5) I will move to (1,4)


My next move coordinates are: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I moved back to (1, 4) and there's no empty space to move above or to the sides that would bring me closer to the goal, I'll try to move down.

My current position is (1, 4), and I will move down to (2, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll try to move down again to get closer to the goal.

My current position is (2, 4), and I will move down to (3, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll try to move down again to get closer to the goal.

My current position is (3, 4), and I will move down to (4, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (4, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L-shape" or "L-corridor"

Here's a new maze with the same size and shape, but with a different layout:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has an L-shaped corridor formed by the empty spaces, and it meets all the criteria mentioned. The path from P to G can be reached through the empty spaces, and the maze is not an identical copy of the original.
