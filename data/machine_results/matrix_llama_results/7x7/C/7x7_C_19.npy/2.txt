You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'd be happy to help solve the maze.

Based on the given maze, the current player position (P) is at coordinates (2, 3). The goal position (G) is at coordinates (4, 3).

My next move would be to move up to the empty space at coordinates (1, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect this move, and I'll plan my next step accordingly.

New player position: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I have moved up to the empty space.

My next move would be to move right to the empty space at coordinates (1, 4).

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

New player position: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved right to the empty space.

My next move would be to move right again to the empty space at coordinates (1, 5).

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

New player position: (1, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved right again to the empty space.

My next move would be to move right again to the empty space at coordinates (1, 6).

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

New player position: (1, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've reached the rightmost edge of the maze. Now I need to move down.

My next move would be to move down to the empty space at coordinates (2 is not possible, so I move down to) (3 is not possible, so I move down to) (4 is not possible directly below P at x=6, but there is a valid space at x=3) (4, 3) No, I move down to the row below and choose another valid x coordinate (5, some x).

 Wait  move down to (no not down to (2,x) as there is no valid space) (move down to (3,x) there is no valid space at x=6 but look at other x's on the row below) there is no valid entry so (move down to (4,x) on this row there is no valid space at 4,6 but there is a valid space 3 units to the left there is a G but it is not the most direct path to the G without reckoning other paths)(5,x).

Because I came to the G while going down, then considered back tracking to (4,6)(moving then left on 5 would ultimately fail from what I see) however seeing the space at current G respects down and could reach it doing such.

move down from row (1) with valid G on row 5 move down to row with G closer- (I came down four and head left in runs using other cursor point doesn't matter eg P falls then on)5 left 3

You want to move down from the current position (1, 6). However, there is no valid space directly below at (2, 6). You need to move down to a row that has a valid space.

A possible move is to move down to row 4 and then left to column 3, which is the goal position. However, you can't move directly from (1, 6) to (4, 3).

A more viable option is to move down to row 5, which has a valid space at column 3, and also contains the goal position. Then, you can move left to reach the goal.

So, the correct move is to move down to (5, 6), and then you can plan your next move to reach the goal.

New player position: (5, 6)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L" shape

The original maze had a corridor that moved horizontally to the right, then turned down to reach the goal.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "L" shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it still forms an "L" shape with its empty spaces, and it includes a valid path from P to G.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
