You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Currently, I am at the position marked 'P', which is (3, 2) or row 3 and column 2. My goal is to reach 'G', which is at (4, 2).

Since I can move in the up, down, left, or right direction to an adjacent empty space, I will choose to move to the empty space adjacent to 'P' that brings me closer to 'G' or at least doesn't block my path.

Looking at the maze, I can see that moving down to (4, 2) is not immediately possible because of the wall between 'P' and 'G'. So, I will choose to move to (3, 3), which is the empty space to the right of 'P'.

However, upon closer inspection, I realize that moving to the right of 'P' or to (3, 3) is also not possible because of the wall present at that position. 

Considering other possible moves:
- Moving to the left of 'P' would mean going further away from 'G' with no immediate benefits or direct pathways to the goal.
- Moving up from 'P' appears feasible but again does not bring me closer to 'G' and doesn't seem to contribute directly to reaching the goal.

Therefore, my best choice is to find an alternative path that may eventually allow me to approach 'G'. Given the constraints, the most promising move from 'P' at (3, 2) is to move to the available empty space that is closest and might potentially be part of a path towards 'G'.

Given the constraints and the situation:
My next move would be to the position (2, 3) which involves moving up from the current position and then proceeding towards the empty spaces. However, given the initial condition and tuning my analysis, moving up to row 2 places me in a tighter spot with no clear path ahead, thus a better step considering my explanation, should be focused on opening up possibilities.

Reevaluating the map with a clearer step-by-step perspective and initial misjudgment, let’s reassess the situation for a worthy move.

The most viable step seems to be towards a vacant space that unlocks potential routes:
Thus, moving to (3, 1) considering paths might unfold productively from that direction.

Let's refocus on solving the maze.

Given the original maze and starting position 'P' at (3, 2), my objective is to find a path to 'G' at (4, 2).

To make a straightforward move, I'll analyze the immediate surroundings of 'P'. Since moving directly to 'G' is blocked by a wall, I need to find an alternative path.

Looking at the maze, the most immediate and promising empty space to move to from 'P' (3, 2) is to the left, to position (3, 1). This move does not immediately get me closer to 'G', but it keeps my options open for finding a path around the walls.

Thus, my next move's coordinates would be (3, 1), aiming to navigate through the maze effectively and find a path to 'G'.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze appears to be an upside-down 'T'.

(2) Here's a new maze with the same size (7x7), a valid path from P to G, and empty spaces that form a similar upside-down 'T' shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This maze has a similar structure to the original, with an upside-down 'T' shape formed by the empty spaces. However, it is not an identical copy of the original maze, and the path from P to G is new.
