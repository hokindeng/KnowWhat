You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'd be happy to help solve the maze.

After analyzing the maze, I see that the current player position (P) is at (1, 4). My goal is to move towards the goal position (G).

My next move would be to move left to the empty space adjacent to the current position. The coordinates of my next move would be:

(1, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I'll be happy to make my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (1, 3).

My next move would be to move left to the empty space adjacent to the current position. The coordinates of my next move would be:

(1, 2)

I'm trying to get closer to the top-left corner of the empty area to create more possibilities for future moves. Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (1, 2).

My next move would be to move down to the empty space adjacent to the current position. The coordinates of my next move would be:

(2, 2)

This move will help me get closer to the goal (G) and provide more options for future moves. Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2, 2).

My next move would be to move down to the empty space adjacent to the current position. The coordinates of my next move would be:

(3, 2)

I'm getting closer to the goal (G), and this move will bring me one step closer. Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 P G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (3, 2) and right next to the goal (G) at position (3, 3).

My next move would be to move right to the goal position (G). The coordinates of my next move would be:

(3, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect that I have reached the goal!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

For the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, a valid path from P to G, and forms an L-shape with its empty spaces. Note that it's not an identical copy of the original maze, but the general shape of the corridors is recognizable as an L-shape.
