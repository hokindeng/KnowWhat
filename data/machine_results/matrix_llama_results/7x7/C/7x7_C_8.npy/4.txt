You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move. 

Given the current player position 'P' is at coordinates (1,4) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (3,3), I want to move closer to the goal while avoiding walls. The adjacent empty space to the current position that is most promising for reaching the goal is to the left.

My next move will be to coordinates (1,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll plan my next move.

My current position 'P' is now at coordinates (1,3). Since I'm trying to reach the goal 'G' at coordinates (3,3) and I'm currently above it, I'll aim to move down. However, I need to navigate through the empty spaces to avoid the wall at (2,3). 

I'll move down to coordinates (2,3) is not an option since there's a wall, so I'll try to move around the wall by going down through the adjacent empty space to the left. 

My next move will be to coordinates (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll plan my next move.

My current position 'P' is now at coordinates (2,2). The goal 'G' is still at coordinates (3,3), and I need to move around the wall at (2,3). Since I've gone down to (2,2), my next move will be to go right and then down, but I'll first move down to (3,2) to get closer to the goal. 

My next move will be to coordinates (3,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 P G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm close to the goal now.

My current position 'P' is at coordinates (3,2) and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (3,3). Since I'm right next to the goal, my next move will be to move right to the goal.

My next move will be to coordinates (3,3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A rectangular U-shape or a vertical corridor with a horizontal bend.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 P 1 G 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar rectangular U-shape, but the position of the corridor and the location of the goal (G) have changed. The player (P) must navigate through the corridor to reach the goal (G).
