You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. First, let's identify the current position of 'P', which is at coordinates (4, 3), and the goal position 'G', which is at coordinates (1, 1).

Given the current state of the maze, my possible moves from 'P' (4, 3) are limited because there are walls ('1') around most adjacent spaces. However, I can move to the space above 'P', which is (3, 3), or to the left, which is (4, 2). Both are valid moves, but moving to (4, 2) seems to be a more straightforward path towards the goal based on the given maze state.

Therefore, my next move will be to (4, 2), the space left of 'P'.

Please update the maze accordingly to reflect my new position as 'P' at (4, 2), and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze with 'P' now at (4, 2), my next goal is to move closer to 'G' while avoiding walls. The space above me at (3, 2) is blocked by a wall ('1'), so I cannot move upwards. However, the space to the left at (4, 1) is an empty space ('0'), which presents a valid path towards the goal.

My next move will be to (4, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that 'P' is at (4, 1), I'm closer to the goal but still have to navigate around the walls to reach 'G'. Since the goal is above me and to the right, my ideal move would be upwards. However, the space directly above me at (3, 1) is blocked by a wall ('1'). I'll have to find an alternative route.

Moving to the right would not bring me closer to the goal efficiently, and moving downwards is not an option since it takes me further away from 'G'. The space to the left is outside the maze, which is also not a valid move.

Upon closer inspection, I notice that moving up is not possible directly, but if I move right to (4, 2) and then reassess my surroundings, I might find a better path. Since I was just at (4, 2) and determined moving left to (4, 1) was a good idea, I need to rethink my strategy considering my goal.

Given the constraints and reevaluating my last moves, a more strategic move seems to go back to (4, 2) and then up to (3, 2) is not an option due to the wall. However, going back to (4, 2) is not progress but regression. The actual valid move seems to be moving up through a path that is not directly available. Upon reevaluation, considering the constraints and my objective:

My best immediate move given the direct options available is not ideal but would be to move right to (4, 2), however, since this is regress and not progress I will reassess. Actually my best move is a wait for more maze updates for potential other path as going up is blocked by a wall and going right doesn't help with my direct progress to G or it requires substantial  there analysis for progress.

There seems I can go to position  alone (4,0), it requires more analysis later to make path arbitrarily I choose that way since not direct progress available currently


Please let me continue after this and access further into the maze if possible.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as resembling a "staircase" or more accurately, since the turns are at right angles and form somewhat a spiral an "L-shape" or a more complex shape, based on limited information from the provided maze.


2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that attempt to form a similar staircase or L-shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This maze maintains the same dimensions as the original and includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces, forming a staircase-like or an "L" pattern. It is not an identical copy of the original maze but meets the specified criteria.
