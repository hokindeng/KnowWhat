You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'd be happy to help solve the maze.

Based on the initial maze, I see that the current player position 'P' is at coordinates (4, 3), and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (1, 1).

My next move will be to move 'P' to the left, which means I will move to the adjacent empty space at coordinates (4, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will be happy to provide the next move.

Current move: (4, 3) -> (4, 2)

Please provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at coordinates (4, 2), my next move will be to move 'P' up to the adjacent empty space at coordinates (3, 2).

Current move: (4, 2) -> (3, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

(Note: If my move is valid, the maze should update accordingly. If my move is invalid, please let me know and I'll reassess the situation.)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(staircase shape)" or more precisely, a "zigzag staircase".

Here is a new maze with the same size (7x7), where the empty spaces form the same zigzag staircase shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note that this maze meets all the criteria: it has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a zigzag staircase shape.
