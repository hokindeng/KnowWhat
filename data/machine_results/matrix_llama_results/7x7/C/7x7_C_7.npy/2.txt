You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position (4,0), which is an empty space adjacent to my current position (4,0 doesn't exist, I mean the position directly above me).

However, the correct way to represent it would be (3,0) since the first index (row) starts at 0 and so does the second index (column). The 'P' is in the 5th row, but since we're moving up, we're going to the 4th row, and since we start counting from 0, that would be the 3rd index.

So my move is to (3,0).

Please update the maze to reflect this move, and I will plan my next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will make my next move to the position (3,1), which is an empty space adjacent to my current position.

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

If it's not possible, then I will choose to move to (2,0), which is another empty space adjacent to my current position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm in the 3rd row, I can move to the right to the empty space adjacent to my current position.

My next move is to the position (2,1).

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm in the 3rd row, 2nd column, I can move further to the right to the empty space adjacent to my current position.

My next move is to the position (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll move further to the right to the empty space adjacent to my current position.

My next move is to the position (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've reached the end of the empty spaces in this row, so now I'll move down to the empty space in the next row below.

However, I notice that directly below me is a wall. So, I need to move down and to the left to the next available empty space, but since there are 2 rows with walls directly below me I'll actually need to move down 3 rows, so that's a total of 3 rows down, from the 3rd row (index 2) to the 6th row (index 5).

But I should also notice that moving 3 down and 0 left is also a valid move, and if I moved to (5,3), I'll be directly above the goal and able to move to the goal in my following turn.

My next move is to the position (5,3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A staircase or a zigzag shape

This shape is characterized by a series of alternating left and right turns, resembling a staircase or a zigzag pattern.

For the new maze, I generated a new layout that meets the criteria:

(2) Here is the new maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
P 1 1 1 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar staircase or zigzag shape, but with a different layout and position of the walls. The maze has the same size as the original, and there is a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces.
