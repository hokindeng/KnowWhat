You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (4,0).

After analyzing the maze, I've determined that the only valid move is to the space above the current position, which is at coordinates (3,0). However, I can also consider moving to the space to the right, which is not immediately available due to the wall, but I can move to the space below the current position, which is at coordinates (5,0).

To make progress toward the goal (G), I will choose to move down.

My next move is to coordinates (5,0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at coordinates (5,0), I see that I have a clear path to the goal (G).

My next move will be to the right, toward the goal.

My next move is to coordinates (5,1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

However, I notice that the goal is two spaces to the right, and there's an empty space at (5,1) and then another at (5,2) before reaching the goal (G) at (5,3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A rectangle with a narrow extension or tail at one end.

The rectangle is formed by the empty spaces in the middle rows, and the narrow extension is the shorter corridor that connects the rectangle to the goal (G).

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
P 0 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is still recognizable as a rectangle with a narrow extension or tail at one end.
