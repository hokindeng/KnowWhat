You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 G 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P).

My current position is (6, 2) since indexing starts at 0. 

I will move one step to the right, so my new position will be (6, 3).

Please update the maze and let me know the new state.

Next move coordinates: (6, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 G 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved to the right, I need to start moving up towards the goal position (G). Since the space above me is empty (0), I will make my next move up.

My current position is (6, 3). 

I will move one step up, so my new position will be (5, 3).

Please update the maze and let me know the new state.

Next move coordinates: (5, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "Vertical Rectangular Shaft" or more generally, a "Rectangle".

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 1 1 1
1 0 G 0 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a rectangular shape, but the position of the rectangle has not changed, only the position of P and G have been adjusted within that rectangle, and some minor changes to walls have been made.
