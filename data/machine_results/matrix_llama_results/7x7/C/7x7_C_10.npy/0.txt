You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (5,5). The goal is to reach position G (2,4). My available moves are to go up, down, left, or right from my current position. However, the only valid moves from my current position would be to go up or left, as the right and down directions are blocked by walls.

If I go left from position P (5,5), I will end up in an empty space at (5,4), which might lead me to a possible path to the goal G.

Therefore, my next move would be to the coordinates (5,4). 

Please update the maze to reflect my new position. I will analyze it and plan my subsequent moves accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

From my current position P (5,4) and examining the maze, my next possible moves are to go up, down, left, or right. However, since the goal G (2,4) is directly above me and there are empty spaces in the upward direction, I will choose to move up.

If I go up from position P (5,4), I will end up in an empty space at (4,4), which brings me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to the coordinates (4,4).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position. I will continue to plan my subsequent moves accordingly.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Staircase" shape, also known as a "Diagonal Staircase" or "Step Staircase".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and a valid path from P to G, where the empty spaces form the same "Staircase" shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze meets all the criteria, including having the same size, a valid path from P to G, and a recognizable "Staircase" shape formed by its empty spaces. Note that the new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, with some differences in the placement of walls and empty spaces.
