You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the left, as the space is empty (0) and adjacent to my current position (P).

Current player position (P): (3, 0)

My next move: (3, -1) or simply moving one step to the left to (3, 0 - 1), so the new coordinates will be (3, -1) but considering the 0-based indexing of a 2D array or a grid, we can consider the new position will be (3, 0). However the correct coordinate considering the 0,0 starting point of the maze will be (3, 0). I'll rephrase that. I'm moving to (3, 0) which in other words is remaining in the same X coordinate but changing the Y to the adjacent 0 space to my left so moving to column 0 in row 3 isn't a movement hence I actually want to move to column 0 in the row above hence moving to  **(2,0)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will make my next move up, but since I am already adjacent to a wall up, I will instead move to the right to the empty space (0).

Current player position (P): (2, 0)

My next move: (2, 1)

I will move to the coordinates (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will make my next move to the right, to the empty space (0).

Current player position (P): (2, 1)

My next move: (2, 2)

I will move to the coordinates (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will make my next move to the right, to the empty space (0).

Current player position (P): (2, 2)

My next move: (2, 3)

I will move to the coordinates (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will make my next move down, to the empty space that would eventually allow me to reach the goal position (G).

Current player position (P): (2, 3)

My next move: (3, 3)

I will move to the coordinates (3, 3) and then continue from there to reach the goal position (G).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "**zig-zag" or "staircase**" shape.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and the empty spaces form a zig-zag or staircase shape. Note that the maze is not an identical copy of the original, but the shape of the corridors is recognizable as a zig-zag or staircase.
