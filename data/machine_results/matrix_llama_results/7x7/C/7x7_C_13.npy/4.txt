You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the empty space above my current position. Since the maze coordinates start from (0,0) at the top left corner, my current position 'P' is at (3,0). I will move to the position (2,0).

My next move is to (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will make my next move to the empty space to the right of my current position 'P'. Since the current position is (2,0), I will move to (2,1).

My next move is to (2,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will make my next move to the empty space to the right of my current position 'P'. Since the current position is (2,1), I will move to (2,2).

My next move is to (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will make my next move to the empty space to the right of my current position 'P'. Since the current position is (2,2), I will move to (2,3).

My next move is to (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've reached the rightmost empty space in the row, I will make my next move downwards. Since my current position is (2,3), I will move down to (3,3). However, the position (3,3) is a wall (1), so that's not a valid move. 

Instead, I will move down to a position that is not a wall. Since the current position is (2,3), I will move down and a little left to (3,2) but that's not possible, then to (3,1) but that's not possible, or (3,0). So my next move is to (3,0).

My next move is to (3,0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A rectangle with a vertical extension ( forming an "L" shape) connecting to a longer horizontal corridor.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

(2) New maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 P 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 G 0 0 1

Note that the new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and has empty spaces forming an "L" shape connected to a horizontal corridor.
