You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the empty space above my current position. Since my current position is at 'P', which is at coordinates (3,0), I will move up to (2,0).

My next move is to coordinates (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll move to the right of my current position to the first empty space. Since my current position is at 'P', which is at coordinates (2,0), I will move right to (2,1).

My next move is to coordinates (2,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

0 P 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll move to the right of my current position again to the next empty space. Since my current position is at 'P', which is at coordinates (2,1), I will move right to (2,2).

My next move is to coordinates (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll move to the right of my current position again to the next empty space. Since my current position is at 'P', which is at coordinates (2,2), I will move right to (2,3).

My next move is to coordinates (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've reached the rightmost empty space in the row, I'll move down to the next available empty space. Since my current position is at 'P', which is at coordinates (2,3), I will move down to (3,3), but it's blocked by a wall. So, I will look for the next available empty space, which is at the bottom of the maze.

However, I can move down to the empty space at coordinates (6,0) or (6,1) or (6,2), but I want to be closer to the goal 'G'. So, I will move down to (6,2) to get closer to the goal.

My next move is not directly down, but I'll try to get closer to the goal 'G'. I'll move down to coordinates (6,2) in a few steps, starting with moving down to (3 is blocked, so) (4 is blocked, so) (5 is blocked, so) ... actually, I can only try moving down to the first available empty space, since direct down movement is blocked. I can only try (3 is blocked) so coordinates (5 is not closer but a empty 0 is at y= 6), so I with coordinates must change x.

Since (6,2) can not be next move directly ( maze reg), I'll move down to coordinates ( no x, so  y changes so at  P x position de facto the purpose), this 6 outside so half even start, until) x=0/Px ke even bet).

You are at position (2,3) and you want to get to the goal 'G' at position (6,3). Since you are blocked by a wall below you, you can try to move left to (2,2) or go back to the leftmost part of the maze and move down.

A simpler and more promising move would be to go back to the leftmost part of the maze. Let's try to move left to (2,2).

My next move is to coordinates (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved left to (2,2), my next move will be to move left again to (2,1), trying to reach the leftmost part of the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A rectangular tunnel or a "U-shaped" tunnel with a horizontal path at the bottom connecting to a vertical path on the left side.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
P 0 0 0 0 G 1
