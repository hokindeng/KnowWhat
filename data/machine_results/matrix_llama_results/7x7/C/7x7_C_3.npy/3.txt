You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position (3, 5) as it's an empty space that is adjacent to the current player position.

Current player position (P) is at coordinates (3, 3). My next move is to (3, 4), which is one position to the right.

So, the coordinates of my next move are (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the position (3, 2).

Current player position (P) is at coordinates (3, 4). My next move is to (3, 3), which is one position to the left, but that's the old position. Then I move again to the left to (3, 2).

However, considering the given maze again I choose (4, 1) as my next position as my current choice has been to the left and downward movement would mean me getting to the goal with a short path

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a " Zigzag" or "Staircase" shape.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same Zigzag shape:


1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 P 1 1
1 G 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note that this new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and its empty spaces form a recognizable Zigzag shape.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
