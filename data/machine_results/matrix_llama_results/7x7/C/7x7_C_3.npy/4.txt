You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position (3, 5) as it's an empty space that is adjacent to the current player position.

Current player position (P): (3, 3)
Goal position (G): (5, 1)
Next move: (3, 4)

Please update the maze and present it to me again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the position (3, 2), as it's an empty space that is adjacent to the current player position and a step closer to the top edge of the maze, which could provide more options for future moves.

Current player position (P): (3, 4)
Goal position (G): (5, 1)
Next move: (3, 3)

Please update the maze and present it to me again.



 CORRECTION 

Current player position (P): (3, 4)
Goal position (G): (5, 1)
Next move: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll make my next move to the position (3, 1), as it's an empty space that is adjacent to the current player position.

Current player position (P): (3, 2)
Goal position (G): (5, 1)
Next move: (3, 1)

Please update the maze and present it to me again.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "T-Shape" or " Fork-like shape" with an extra arm at the bottom that is disconnected from the main path.

Here's a new maze with the same size, and a new T-Shape formed by the empty spaces:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size, includes a valid path from P to G, is not identical to the original maze, and has a general T-Shape formed by the empty spaces.
