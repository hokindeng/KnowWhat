You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by identifying the current player position (P) and the goal position (G). The current player position is at (3, 3) and the goal position is at (5, 1).

To make my first move, I will analyze the adjacent positions to the current player position. The possible moves are:

- Up: (2, 3) - Wall (1)
- Down: (4, 3) - Wall (1)
- Left: (3, 2) - Empty space (0)
- Right: (3, 4) - Empty space (0)

I will choose to move to the left, as it is one of the available options that brings me closer to the goal. The coordinates of my next move are (3, 2).

Please update the maze accordingly, and I will be ready for the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the adjacent positions to the current player position (P) again. The possible moves are:

- Up: (2, 2) - Wall (1) but (2, 2) is actually on a (1 1 1 1 1 1 1) row, in position 2. I was wrong it was the third row, the actual position above the current position is  (2,2) = third row second element: also Wall (1)
- Down: (4, 2) - Wall (1)
- Left: (3, 1) - Empty space (0)
- Right: (3, 3) - Empty space (0)

I will choose to move to the left, as it is one of the available options that brings me closer to the goal and I can potentially turn downwards in the following turn towards the G. The coordinates of my next move are (3, 1).

Please update the maze accordingly, and I will be ready for the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the adjacent positions to the current player position (P) again. The possible moves are:

- Up: (2, 1) - Wall (1) also the third row is entirely walls
- Down: (4, 1) - Empty space (0)
- Left: (3, 0) - Wall (1)
- Right: (3, 2) - Empty space (0)

I will choose to move down, as it is the best available option that brings me closer to the goal and potentially lets me reach G in fewer steps. The coordinates of my next move are (4, 1).

Please update the maze accordingly, and I will be ready for the next step

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the adjacent positions to the current player position (P) again. The possible moves are:

- Up: (3, 1) - Empty space (0)
- Down: (5, 1) - Goal (G)
- Left: (4, 0) - Wall (1)
- Right: (4, 2) - Wall (1)

I will choose to move down, as it is the best available option that lets me directly reach the goal. The coordinates of my next move are (5, 1).

This move should bring me to the goal position, and the maze should be solved.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A rectangle with a vertical extension (like a tail) at the bottom.

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 G P 0 1 1

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it shares the same general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors).
