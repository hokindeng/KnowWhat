You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right, as the space is empty (0) and it's closer to the goal position (G). 

My current position is at (1, 5), and I will move to (1, 6). After this move, the updated maze should look like this:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please confirm the updated maze and I'll proceed with the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the current state of the maze, I will make my next move down, as the space below me is empty (0) and it's a step closer to the goal position (G).

My current position is at (1, 6), and I will move to (2, 6). However, I see that there is a wall (1) at (2, 6), so I will actually move to (3, 6) and then to the left (3, 5) to (3, 5) in two steps isn't an option as I am only allowed to provide my next move. I can however move down to (2 is blocked so my next move is to the left back to (1,5)). My next move is (1, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back to the previous position. Now, I will move down to (2, 5), since the space below me is empty (0) and it's a step closer to the goal position (G).

So, my next move is to (2, 5).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "staircase".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 P
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a staircase shape, and there is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces. The maze has the same size as the original, but it is not an identical copy.
