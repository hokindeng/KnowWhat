You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the empty space adjacent to the player position.

Current position: P (located at (1,5))
My next move will be to the empty space on the left, which is at coordinates (1,4).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the empty space below the current position.

Current position: P (located at (1,4))
My next move will be to the empty space below, which is at coordinates (2,4).

However, since the space below the current position is not empty (there is a wall at (2,4) and an empty space at (2,4) doesn't exist but there is one at (2,3 and also at 3,4), I will instead choose to move down to (3 isn't available due to the wall at (2,4) but it would be available if the wall were at (3,4) and also not more than one space away from a goal), no so the space at position 3,4 can be accessed in the future, instead move down to 2,3 since it exists and isn't blocked and is on the way to position 3,4 which would make the path to goal possible), so the correct response that provides a path without a blocked future potential path as proposed by 'available at (3,4)),' is coordinates (2,3) .

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "staircase" or an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape, similar to the original maze. The player position (P) is located at the bottom, and the goal position (G) is located at the top-right part of the L-shape. The maze is not identical to the original, but the general shape of the corridors is recognizable as an L-shape.
