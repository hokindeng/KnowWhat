You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by identifying the current player position (P) and the goal position (G). The current player position is at coordinates (4, 1), and the goal position is at coordinates (5, 3).

To navigate to the goal position, my next move will be to the space directly below the current player position. Therefore, my next move will be to coordinates (5, 1).

Please update the maze accordingly and provide it again. I will then plan my next move based on the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at coordinates (5, 1), my next move will be to the space to the right. Therefore, my next move will be to coordinates (5, 2).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at coordinates (5, 2), I see that the goal (G) is directly to my right. However, I can also move to the right space adjacent to the goal position. Therefore, my next move will be to coordinates (5, 3).

Please let me know if I reach the goal or update the maze accordingly if I need to make further moves.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (5, 3) and I see that the goal (G) is directly to my right. My next move will be to coordinates (5, 4), which will put me at the goal position.

This should be the final move to solve the maze!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a "bent tunnel".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
Note that this maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and has a recognizable L-shape formed by its empty spaces. However, it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
