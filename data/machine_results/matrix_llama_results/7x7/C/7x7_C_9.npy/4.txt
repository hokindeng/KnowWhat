You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at (5,0), and the goal 'G' is at (1,0). Since my current position is at the bottom left corner, the only valid move I can make is to move right. I will try to move to the empty space to the right of my current position.

The coordinates of my next move are (5,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since my current position 'P' is at (5,1), I will try to move right again. There is an empty space at (5,2) that I can move to.

The coordinates of my next move are (5,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving right. There is an empty space at (5,3) that I can move to.

However, I notice that moving up might be a better long-term strategy to reach the goal 'G'. But for now, I'll stick with moving right.

The coordinates of my next move are (5,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved to (5,3), I see that moving up is a more attractive option to get closer to the goal 'G'. I will try to move up to the empty space at (4,3).

The coordinates of my next move are (4,3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) L-shape

The empty spaces form a rough L-shape that connects the starting position 'P' to the goal 'G'.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

0 0 0 1 1 1 1
G 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
P 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it maintains the same L-shape in its empty spaces, allowing for a valid path from 'P' to 'G'.
