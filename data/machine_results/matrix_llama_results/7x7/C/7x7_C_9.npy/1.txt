You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since we're at the position marked 'P', we are at the coordinates (5, 0). Our goal 'G' is at the coordinates (1, 0).

Looking at the maze, the most straightforward path seems to involve moving up towards the goal 'G'. Since we can move in the up, down, left, or right direction to any adjacent empty space, the best next move from the current position (5, 0) would be to move up.

So, my next move would be to the coordinates (4, 0), which is directly above the current position.

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome of this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I'm now at the coordinates (4, 0), and the goal 'G' is still at the coordinates (1, 0).

Since my ultimate goal is to move up towards the goal 'G', I will attempt to move up again. However, I need to check if the space above me is empty.

Looking at the maze, I see that the space above me, at coordinates (3, 0), is empty ('0'). Therefore, my next move would be to move up to the coordinates (3, 0).

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome of this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I'm now at the coordinates (3, 0), and the goal 'G' is still at the coordinates (1, 0).

Since I'm getting closer to the goal, I'll attempt to move up again. I need to check if the space above me is empty.

Looking at the maze, I see that the space above me, at coordinates (2, 0), is empty ('0'). Therefore, my next move would be to move up to the coordinates (2, 0).

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome of this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at the coordinates (2, 0), and the goal 'G' is right above me at coordinates (1, 0).

Since I'm so close to the goal, my next move would be to move up to the coordinates (1, 0), which is where the goal 'G' is.

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome of this move. I hope I'll have reached the goal successfully!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would say that:

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a "Vertical Rectangle" or more specifically, a vertical strip or column.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:
 
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is still a vertical strip or column, similar to the original maze.
