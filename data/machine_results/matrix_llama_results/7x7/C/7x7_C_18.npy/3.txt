You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the empty space above the current position 'P'. This move will be in the up direction.

The coordinates of the current position 'P' are (1,0). The coordinates of the next move will be (0,0).

Please update the maze with the new position and present it again for my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current position 'P'. 

The coordinates of the current position 'P' are (0,0). The coordinates of the next move will be (0,1).

Please update the maze with the new position and present it again for my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will make my next move to the right of the current position 'P' again. 

The coordinates of the current position 'P' are (0,1). The coordinates of the next move will be (0,2).

Please update the maze with the new position and present it again for my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will make my next move to the right of the current position 'P' again. 

The coordinates of the current position 'P' are (0,2). The coordinates of the next move will be (0,3).

Please update the maze with the new position and present it again for my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've reached the rightmost possible position on this row, I will make my next move down.

The coordinates of the current position 'P' are (0,3). The coordinates of the next move will be (1,3).

Please update the maze with the new position is not possible since there is a wall, so I will move further down instead.

The coordinates of the next move will be (2,3) is also not possible, but (3,3) is possible.

The coordinates of the next move will be (3,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A vertical L-shape or a simplified version of a hook.

For the new maze with the same size and shape, I present to you:

0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it maintains the same size and has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, forming a similar vertical L-shape or hook.
