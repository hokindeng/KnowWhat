You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by analyzing the surroundings of the current player position 'P'. It's at (1,0). I can move up, but since I'm already at the second row and there's no wall or obstacle above me at (0,0), it seems like a safe starting direction. My next move will be to (0,0).

Next move coordinates: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (0,0). Since the goal is at a lower row and I have empty spaces below me, I will start moving downwards. The next empty space is directly below me at (1,0).

Next move coordinates: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (1,0). Since moving down at (2,0) is possible and will bring me closer to the goal, that's where I'll head.

Next move coordinates: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at (2,0). Since moving down to (3,0) is still possible, and getting closer to the goal is the priority, I'll make my next move there.

Next move coordinates: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at (3,0) and I can see the goal 'G' right next to me at (3,1). My next move will be to reach the goal.

Next move coordinates: (3,1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a "corner shape". This is because the path from the starting point to the goal forms a 90-degree angle, resembling the shape of a corner or an L.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:
```
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 P 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
In this new maze, the empty spaces also form an L-shape, allowing the player to navigate from the starting point to the goal. The maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G, while being a distinct and non-identical copy of the original maze.
