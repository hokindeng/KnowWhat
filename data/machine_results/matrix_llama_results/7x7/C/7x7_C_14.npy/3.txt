You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 P 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right, as there is an empty space adjacent to the current player position (P) in that direction. My next move will be to the coordinates (0,2).

Current position: (0,1)
Next position: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move down, as there is an empty space below the current player position (P). However, since moving directly down would lead to a wall, I'll move down when there's an empty space. But for now, I'll move to the right again to the coordinates (0,3).

Current position: (0,2)
Next position: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 1 1 1

0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move down. Since the current position is (0,3), my next move will be to the coordinates (1,3), but that's a wall. I'll need to move down when there's an empty space. However, looking further down, I see there is a path at (4,3). For now, I'll move down to (no I won't move to a wall), I will stay at (0,x) for a while and move further to the right where there isn't a wall at the moment then move down when there is an opportunity to do so. In that case, I will move down to y = 4 at x= 0, 1, 2 or 3 in this case, But because of the distance, I will continue to the right until I get to x=3 I already am then move down isn't possible so will move further right until I'm able to move down which isn't possible currently, so I will move my rightmost available position (0,3), I moved furthest available now I will move to left. to (0,2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I'm back at (0,2), my next move will be to the left, as there is an empty space in that direction. I will move to the coordinates (0,1).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I'm at (0,0), I can see that moving left isn't an option anymore. However, moving right or down will lead me to the same paths that I've already explored. Upon closer inspection, I realize that I should move down to the bottom left corner, but this path is blocked by the walls.

To make progress, I'll try moving right again, even though I've already explored this path before. Perhaps I can find a new path or see the problem from a different angle. I'll move to the right, so my next move will be to the coordinates (0,1).

After re-examining the maze, I realize that I've been trying to move down too early. Instead, I should try to move as far right as possible and then look for opportunities to move down. However, in this case, moving right isn't an option. Therefore, I'll move left to the coordinates (0,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, where the empty spaces form a similar L-shape:


1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape. Note that the position of the L-shape is different from the original maze, and the maze itself is not an identical copy of the original.
