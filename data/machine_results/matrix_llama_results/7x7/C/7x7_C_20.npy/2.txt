You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

P 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P). Since the coordinates of the top left corner are (0,0), the current player position (P) is at (0,0). I will move to the position (0,1), which is an empty space.

My next move coordinates are (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I'm now at position (0,1), I'll move to the right again to the next empty space at position (0,2).

My next move coordinates are (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I'm now at position (0,2), I'll move to the right again to the next empty space at position (0,3).

My next move coordinates are (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I'm now at position (0,3), I'll move to the right again to the next empty space at position (0,4).

My next move coordinates are (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I'm now at position (0,4) and the space to the right is a wall, I'll move down to the next empty space at position (1,4). However, the space at (1,4) is also a wall. I'll need to move down again to find an empty space. Let's try position (4,4) since the wall below me extends for several rows, but there's an empty space on the row where the goal is. To get there, I'll first move down to row 4, staying in the same column. 

My next move coordinates are (4,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A winding "L" shape or an "L" corridor

This shape is characterized by a long horizontal or vertical corridor that makes a right-angle turn, resulting in an "L" shape.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

P 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an "L" shape, with a horizontal corridor that makes a right-angle turn to reach the goal (G). The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape and can be solved by navigating through the empty spaces.
