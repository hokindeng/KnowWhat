You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To start, I need to locate the current player position 'P' and find an adjacent empty space to move to.

The current player position 'P' is found at coordinates (3, 2), considering that the top left corner is (0,0). An adjacent empty space is found directly above the current position at coordinates (2, 2).

My next move will be to the coordinates (2, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and provide it back to me so I can plan the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 G 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2, 2). To navigate towards the goal 'G', my next move should be to an adjacent empty space. The most direct path appears to be moving right.

There is an empty space to the right of my current position at coordinates (2, 3).

My next move will be to the coordinates (2, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P G 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2, 3), and my goal 'G' is right next to me at position (2, 4). Since I can move to the goal directly, that's what I will do.

My next move will be to the coordinates (2, 4).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position. If I'm correct, I should have reached the goal!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path" since it has a clear bend from a vertical corridor to a horizontal one.

Here is a new maze that meets the given criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape similar to the original, but with the path bending from a vertical corridor to a horizontal one in a different part of the maze, and with the start and goal positions adjusted accordingly.
