You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G', my first move will be up since moving down, left, or right would directly hit a wall. The coordinates of 'P' are (3,2), and moving up means reducing the row number by 1. So, my next move will be to the coordinates (2,2).

Please update the maze with my new position at (2,2) and let me know the new maze configuration to plan my subsequent move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 G 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my current position at (2,2) and the goal 'G' visible to the right, I will plan to move right to get closer to the goal. Moving right means increasing the column number by 1. So, my next move will be to the coordinates (2,3).

Please update the maze with my new position at (2,3) and let me know the new maze configuration to plan my subsequent move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P G 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting close to the goal 'G'! With my current position at (2,3) and the goal right next to me, I will plan to move right again to reach the goal. Moving right means increasing the column number by 1. So, my next move will be to the coordinates (2,4).

Please update the maze with my new position at (2,4) and let me know if I've successfully reached the goal 'G'!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag stairway" or simply a "stairway".

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 P 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and features a stairway-shaped corridor formed by the empty spaces. Note that the exact shape and orientation of the stairway may vary slightly from the original, but it should still be recognizable as a stairway.
