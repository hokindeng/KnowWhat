You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 P 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at (6, 5), and the goal is at (4, 0).

The possible moves from the current position are:

* Up: (6, 4) - which is an empty space
* Down: Not a valid move, as there's a wall below
* Left: (5, 5) - which is an empty space
* Right: Not a valid move, as there's a wall to the right

Considering the overall maze structure and our goal to reach (4, 0), I think the best next move is to go up to (6, 4).

So, my next move is: (6, 4)

Please update the maze with my new position and present it to me again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (6, 4), the possible moves are:

* Up: (6, 3) - which is an empty space
* Down: Not a valid move, as there's a wall or I'd be moving back to the previous position
* Left: (5, 4) - which is an empty space
* Right: (7, 4) - which is a wall

Considering the overall maze structure and our goal to reach (4, 0), I think the best next move is to go left to (5, 4).

However, I notice that the left path might lead to a dead end. So, a more strategic move would be to go up to (6, 3), keeping the left path as an option for now.

So, my next move is: (6, 3)

Please update the maze with my new position and present it to me again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (6, 3), the possible moves are:

* Up: (6, 2) - which is an empty space
* Down: Not a valid move, as there's a wall or I'd be moving back to the previous position
* Left: (5, 3) - which is an empty space
* Right: (7, 3) - Not a valid move, as there's a wall

Considering the overall maze structure and our goal to reach (4, 0), I think the best next move is to go left to (5, 3), and then I can explore going up to try to find a path to the goal.

So, my next move is: (5, 3)

Please update the maze with my new position and present it to me again.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L-shape" or "Right Angle Corridor"

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 P 0

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and forms an L-shape with its empty spaces. It is not an identical copy of the original maze.
