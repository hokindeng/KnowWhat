You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position (P) is at coordinates (4,1). Our goal position (G) is at coordinates (4,3). To move towards the goal position, we can only move up, down, left, or right.

From the current player position, we can move to any adjacent empty space. Let's move down to the empty space at coordinates (5,1). However, since the maze only has 5 rows and rows are indexed from 0, moving down would put us outside the maze. Therefore, moving down is not an option.

Let's move to the empty space to the right of the current player position, which is at coordinates (4,2). Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (4,2). 

Is the move correct?

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 P G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the updated maze. The current player position (P) is now at coordinates (4,2). The goal position (G) is still at coordinates (4,3), which is directly to the right of our current position.

Since we can move to any adjacent empty space in the up, down, left, or right direction, and our goal position is directly to the right, we can move right to the goal position. Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (4,3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, a valid path from P to G, and an L-shaped corridor:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 G

This new maze has the same 5x5 size as the original, and the empty spaces form an L-shape that connects the starting position P to the goal position G. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it retains the same general shape and properties.
