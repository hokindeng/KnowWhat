You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right, as the space next to me is an empty space. Therefore, the coordinates of my next move will be (4,1).

Please update the maze and let me know the new state. I'll be happy to make my next move from there.

Also, just to clarify, the starting coordinates of the player 'P' are (4,0) in the given maze, right?

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would say that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is an "L-shape" or a corner shape, where two corridors meet at a right angle.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:
```
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0
1 P 0 0 G
```
In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar L-shape, with the player 'P' starting at the bottom left and the goal 'G' at the bottom right. The maze is not identical to the original, but it has the same size and a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through the empty spaces.
