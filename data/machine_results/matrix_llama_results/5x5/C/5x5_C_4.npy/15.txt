You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. The player is currently at position (4,1) and the goal is at position (0,1). Since the player can only move through empty spaces, the goal is to find a path that avoids the walls (represented by '1').

The next move should be to move up to position (3,1), but since there is a wall at that position, that's not possible. Instead, I will move the player to the right to position (4,2).

So, my next move is to position (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze. Since the player is now at position (4,2), and the goal is to move towards the top-left part of the maze, the best next move would be to move up to position (3,2). However, since there's a wall at position (3,2), I will move the player to the right to position (4,3).

So, my next move is to position (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that the player is at position (4,3), the next move should be to move right to position (4,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that the player is at position (4,4), there are no more moves available to the right, so it's time to think about moving up. Since the ultimate goal is to reach the 'G' at the top, I'll try to move up. There is a wall in the way, but since the wall doesn't extend all the way to the right edge of the maze, I can try to move up by going around the wall from the right side. My next move is to position (3,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, where the empty spaces form the same L-shape:


0 0 0 0 G
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0


This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
