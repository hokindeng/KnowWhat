You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since we can only move to empty spaces that are adjacent to our current position, let's take a look at the neighbors of our current position.

We are currently at (4, 1), where the 'P' is located. 

Looking at the neighbors:

* Up: (3, 1) has a wall (1), so we cannot move up.
* Down: We are already at the bottom row, so moving down is not possible.
* Left: (4, 0) is an empty space (0), which is a valid move.
* Right: (4, 2) is also an empty space (0), which is a valid move.

Considering our goal is to reach the 'G' at (0, 1), we should try to move closer to it. However, we cannot move up due to the wall. We can move either left or right, but moving right would not bring us closer to the goal in the long run. Therefore, it's better to move left and try to find an alternative path.

The coordinates of my next move would be (4, 0).

Please let me know if the move is valid, and I'll be happy to proceed with the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm glad I was able to move successfully.

Analyzing the updated maze, I can see that I have a clear path to the left. However, I need to get closer to the goal 'G' at (0, 1), which is still quite far. I'll keep moving left to see if I can find an opportunity to move up.

Since there are no obstacles to my left, my next move will be to (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems I've reached the leftmost column, but I still need to find a way to get closer to the goal 'G' at (0, 1).

Analyzing the updated maze, I can see that the only possible move is to move up. I'm at (3, 0), and the cell above me at (2, 0) is empty. 

My next move will be to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting closer to the goal.

Analyzing the updated maze, I can see that the cell above me at (1, 0) is empty, and the cell above that at (0, 0) is also empty. However, the goal 'G' is at (0, 1), so I should try to move right as soon as possible.

But for now, I'll move up to (1, 0) to get closer to the top row where the goal is located.

My next move will be to (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm almost there.

Analyzing the updated maze, I can see that I'm at (1, 0) and the goal 'G' is at (0, 1), which is diagonally up and right from my current position. Since I can only move in one of the four main directions (up, down, left, or right), I need to move up to (0, 0) first and then move right to reach the goal.

My next move will be to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm right next to the goal.

Since I'm at (0, 0) and the goal 'G' is at (0, 1), I can move directly right to reach the goal.

My next move will be to (0, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would say that:

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze of the same size with the same L-shape formed by the empty spaces:

0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P
G 1 1 1 0

In this new maze, the path from P to G is still solvable through the empty spaces, which form an L-shape. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it has the same size and shape characteristics.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
