You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by analyzing the situation. I am currently at position P, which is (4,1).

Since my goal is to reach position G, which is (0,1), my general strategy will be to move upwards while avoiding walls.

My next move will be to move up from my current position (4,1) to (3,1). However, I see that there is a wall at (3,1). Therefore, I need to find an alternative route.

Upon examining the maze, I see that I can move to the right from my current position (4,1) to (4,2), which is an empty space.

My next move will be to (4,2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position. 

Answer: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my current position at (4,2), my next step is to continue moving towards the goal position (0,1).

Since the wall above me is too long to navigate directly upwards, I'll continue moving to the right to try to find a way around the wall.

My next move will be to (4,3), which is an empty space.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Answer: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've reached the position (4,3). My next move will be to continue moving to the right to see if I can find a way around the wall.

My next move will be to (4,4), which is an empty space.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Answer: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've reached the position (4,4). Now that I've moved as far to the right as I can, I'll try to move upwards to get closer to the goal position (0,1).

My next move will be to (3,4), however, I see that (3,4) is a wall. Since I'm already at the far right edge of the maze, I'll move to the left instead.

My next move will be to (4,3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position is not required since I previously occupied (4,3). However I will move back to that position.

Answer: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved back to the position (4,3). I'll continue to try to find a way upwards to reach the goal position (0,1).

Since I still can't move upwards directly due to the wall above me, I'll move to the left instead to try to find another path.

My next move will be to (4,2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Answer: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to the position (4,2). I'll continue to try to find a way upwards to reach the goal position (0,1).

Since I still can't move upwards directly due to the wall above me, I'll move to the left again to try to find another path.

My next move will be to (4,1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Answer: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to the position (4,1) but was already here at the beginning,  I notice that my initial strategy didn't pay off, and I ended up back at the starting position. I should reevaluate my approach.

This time, I'll move upwards as much as possible to the left of the long wall.

However, there is still a wall directly above me. 

I will continue moving to the left, and my next move will be to (4,0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to the position (3,0) but cannot move any further up as the positions above it have walls to the left (my only available path), I see a wall directly above me.

My next move will be to move down to (4,0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.



However, I will move back down, only to move up the left path when available



Answer: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved back to the position (4,0). 

Now that I'm at the left edge, I should move up when a path is available.



However my current available move is to move to the right. or just move up at the next available left position to continue my up KÃ¶nn


My next move will be to move up at the next left open position.



My next move will be (3,0) as it is now open.



Please update the maze to reflect my new position.



Answer: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to the position (3,0). 

Still can't move up because of wall



So move to (2,0)



Answer: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to the position (2,0).



Still cannot move up because of the wall. 



Moving to position (1,0) which also has a wall on top



Answer: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to the position (1,0).

Since the goal position (0,1) is within reach from my current position (1,0), I will now focus on moving towards it.

My next move will be to (0,0), then to the goal (0,1) if possible



But if possible move directly to goal at (0,1)



My next move will be (0,0).



However I will move directly to the goal as (1,0) to (0,1) =multi step avoiding collision with other entities was not necessary



Multi-step moves are not real so move to (0,0) first



Answer: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to the position (0,0).



My goal is now directly to the right



My next move will be to (0,1), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, where the empty spaces form the same L-shape:


0 0 0 0 G
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0


This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
