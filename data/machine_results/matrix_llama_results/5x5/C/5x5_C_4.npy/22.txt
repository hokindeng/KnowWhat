You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since we can only move to empty spaces that are adjacent to our current position, let's take a look at the neighbors of our current position.

We are currently at (4, 1), where the 'P' is located. 

Looking at the neighbors:

* Up: (3, 1) has a wall (1), so we cannot move up.
* Down: We are already at the bottom row, so moving down is not possible.
* Left: (4, 0) is an empty space (0), which is a valid move.
* Right: (4, 2) is also an empty space (0), which is a valid move.

Considering our goal is to reach the 'G' at (0, 1), we should try to move closer to it. However, we cannot move up due to the wall. We can move either left or right, but moving right would not bring us closer to the goal in the long run. Therefore, it's better to move left and try to find an alternative path.

The coordinates of my next move would be (4, 0).

Please let me know if the move is valid, and I'll be happy to proceed with the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm glad the move was valid.

Now that I'm at (4, 0), I'll reassess my surroundings. 

Looking at the neighbors:

* Up: (3, 0) has a wall (1), so we cannot move up.
* Down: We are already at the bottom row, so moving down is not possible.
* Left: We are already at the leftmost column, so moving left is not possible.
* Right: (4, 1) is an empty space (0), which is a valid move.

Since we cannot move up, left, or down, our only option is to move right. However, we've already been at (4, 1) before, and we know that moving up from there is blocked by a wall. Nevertheless, we need to move right to potentially find an alternative path.

The coordinates of my next move would be (4, 1).

Please let me know if the move is valid, and I'll be happy to proceed with the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at (4, 1), my options are the same as before, but this time, I'll try the right direction.

Looking at the neighbors:

* Up: (3, 1) has a wall (1), so we cannot move up.
* Down: We are already at the bottom row, so moving down is not possible.
* Left: (4, 0) is an empty space (0), which is a valid move, but we've already tried that path.
* Right: (4, 2) is an empty space (0), which is a valid move.

I'll try moving right to see if I can find a path that will eventually lead me up and closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move would be (4, 2).

Please let me know if the move is valid, and I'll be happy to proceed with the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (4, 2). My options are:

* Up: (3, 2) has a wall (1), so we cannot move up.
* Down: We are already at the bottom row, so moving down is not possible.
* Left: (4, 1) is an empty space (0), which is a valid move, but we've already tried that path.
* Right: (4, 3) is an empty space (0), which is a valid move.

Since moving left wouldn't help, I'll try moving right to see if I can find a way up or a path that will lead me closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move would be (4, 3).

Please let me know if the move is valid, and I'll be happy to proceed with the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (4, 3). My options are:

* Up: (3, 3) has a wall (1), so we cannot move up.
* Down: We are already at the bottom row, so moving down is not possible.
* Left: (4, 2) is an empty space (0), which is a valid move, but we've already tried that path.
* Right: (4, 4) is an empty space (0), which is a valid move.

Since moving left wouldn't help, I'll try moving right to see if I can find a way up or a path that will lead me closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move would be (4, 4).

Please let me know if the move is valid, and I'll be happy to proceed with the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (4, 4), and I'm at the rightmost edge of the maze.

Since moving right is not an option, I'll try moving up is not possible due to the wall, and moving down is not possible since I'm already at the bottom row. Therefore, my only option is to move left.

However, I'll not just move left randomly. I'll try to move left to a position that might help me find a path up or get closer to the goal.

Let's take a closer look: If I move left to (4, 3) or (4, 2), I'll be back to a position I've already been to, and I know that moving up from those positions is blocked by a wall. If I move left to (4, 1) or (4, 0), I'll also be back to a position I've already been to, and I know that moving up from those positions is blocked by a wall.

Since I don't have any other option but to move left, I'll try moving left to a position that is closest to the leftmost edge. 

The coordinates of my next move would be (4, 0).

Please let me know if the move is valid, and I'll be happy to proceed with the next step.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "inverted U" shape, or more specifically, a "\cup" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "\cup" shape:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

becomes:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1
P 0 0 0 0

This new maze meets the criteria:

* It has the same size as the original maze (5x5)
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces (although it's a bit harder this time)
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an "inverted U" or "\cup" shape.

Note that I replaced two blocks of the wall in the original maze with empty spaces, creating an alternative path while preserving the overall shape of the corridors.
