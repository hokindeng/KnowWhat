You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since we are at position 'P' and our goal is 'G', we want to move towards the goal while avoiding walls.

Our current position is (4, 1), and we can move up, down, left, or right. Since there is a wall above us and to our right, we should move either left or down. Moving down will not bring us closer to the goal, so we will move left.

My next move is to position (4, 0), which is an empty space. 

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, we can see that we've successfully moved to the left. Now, let's examine our next options.

Since there's a wall to our right, and moving down won't bring us closer to the goal, we can move either up or stay on the same x-axis (left or right) to explore more options. Moving up is a better choice, as it brings us closer to the goal.

My next move is to position (3, 0). This should put us one step closer to the goal while keeping us in an empty space.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We've moved up one step. Now, let's assess the situation.

Since there's a wall to our right and we can't move through it, we should move left is not an option, either, as it won't bring us closer to the goal. Our only viable option is to move up again.

My next move is to position (2, 0). This should bring us closer to the goal while keeping us in an empty space.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We've moved up again. Now, let's assess the situation.

Since there's a wall to our right and we can't move through it, we should move up once more. This will bring us to the row with the goal position 'G'.

My next move is to position (1, 0). This should bring us even closer to the goal while keeping us in an empty space.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're now on the same row as the goal. Let's assess the situation.

Since the goal 'G' is to our right and there are no walls between us and the goal, we can simply move right to reach the goal.

My next move is to position (1, 1). This should put us in the goal position.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "L-Shape"

The empty spaces form an L-shape that connects the starting point 'P' to the goal 'G'.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

(2) New Maze:

0 1 1 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 G 0 0 0

This new maze has the same size as the original, and it includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G' that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces form an L-shape, but the maze is not an identical copy of the original.
