You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. The player is currently at position (4, 1), marked by 'P', and the goal is at position (0, 1), marked by 'G'. The objective is to move towards the goal.

Looking at the maze, I can see that moving directly up from the current position is not possible due to the wall above. However, there is an empty space to the right of the player.

I will make the first move to the right, to the position (4, 2). The new coordinates will be:

(4, 2)

Your turn to update the maze!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I have successfully moved to the right. The next move should get me closer to the goal. I'll move up to the next available empty space.

The coordinates of my next move are:

(3, 2)

Your turn to update the maze!

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I can see that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is an "L-shape" or a right-angled corridor.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

0 G 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P

In this new maze, the L-shaped corridor formed by the empty spaces still allows the player to navigate from the starting point 'P' to the goal 'G'. However, the positions of the walls and empty spaces have been altered to create a new, distinct maze.
