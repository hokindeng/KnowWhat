You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. The player is currently at position (4,1) and the goal is at position (0,1). Since the player can only move through empty spaces, we can't move directly to the goal due to the walls in between.

After examining the maze, a viable move would be to move right to the adjacent empty space. The coordinates of the next move would be (4,2).

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, the player is now at position (4,2). The goal is still at position (0,1). A possible next move would be to move right again to the adjacent empty space. The coordinates of the next move would be (4,3).

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, the player is now at position (4,3). The goal is still at position (0,1). A possible next move would be to move right again to the adjacent empty space. The coordinates of the next move would be (4,4).

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, the player is now at position (4,4). The goal is still at position (0,1). A possible next move would be to move up to the adjacent empty space. The coordinates of the next move would be (3,4).

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position.



Alternatively, I could also start moving to the left to get closer to the goal column, but moving up seems like a good starting point.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".


Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


0 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
P 0 0 0 G


This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and forms an L-shape with its corridors. Note that the maze is not an identical copy of the original, but rather a new maze with the same general shape.
