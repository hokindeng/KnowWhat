You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. The player is currently at position (4,1) and the goal is at position (0,1). Since the player can only move through empty spaces, we can't move directly to the goal due to the walls in between.

After examining the maze, a viable move would be to move right to the adjacent empty space. The coordinates of the next move would be (4,2).

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, the player is now at position (4,2). The goal is still at position (0,1). The next step would be to move up towards the goal while avoiding walls.

A suitable move would be to move up to the adjacent empty space. However, moving directly up would put the player at position (3,2), which is a wall. So, we need to find an alternative.

Moving right to position (4,3) is also not desirable as it would move us away from the goal in the long run. A better move would be to move right to position (4,4) or move left to position (4,1) to try to get around the walls. Let's move left to position (4,1) since it's likely the shorter path to the goal.

The coordinates of the next move would be (4,1).

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems we're back to the starting position. We need to find an alternative route. Moving directly up would put us into a wall. We can try moving left, but it would also put us out of the maze's boundaries.

A viable move would be to move right to the adjacent empty space. The coordinates of the next move would be (4,2).

However, we've already tried this path, and it led us to a dead end. So, let's rethink and look for another option.

Since we can't move directly up due to the wall, and moving right didn't lead us to the goal, we can try moving down, but it would also put us out of the maze's boundaries. Another possibility is to move left, but it's also not a valid move due to the boundaries.

Upon closer inspection, we notice that we can try moving to the far right to see if there's an opening above. We can move to (4,4) and then reassess our options from there.

The coordinates of the next move would be (4,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, a valid path from P to G, and an L-shaped corridor:

0 G 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 P 1 1 0

In this new maze, the L-shape is formed by the empty spaces, allowing the player to move from the start position (P) to the goal position (G).
