You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan our next move. The player's current position is (4,1) and the goal position is (0,1). 

Since our goal is to move towards the goal position, let's try to move up. The position above us is (3,1), but it's a wall ('1'). We can't move up.

Let's try to move left. The position to our left is (4,0), and it's an empty space ('0'). We can move left.

So, our next move will be to (4,0). 

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, our current position is (4,0) and the goal position is (0,1).

Since our goal is to move towards the goal position, let's try to move up. The position above us is (3,0), and it's an empty space would be ideal, but there's a wall ('1') to the right at (3,1) and other directions adjacent to (3,0) are also blocked, so we wouldn't get stuck.

However, let's take a closer look and try to move up and see how we progress. 

Our next move will be to (3,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Our current position is (3,0) and the goal position is (0,1).

The position above us is (2,0), but moving up will put us in a similar situation, having walls to our right.

However, since we need to move towards the goal, we must continue moving up. The left column seems to be the only clear path. 

Our next move will be to (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Our current position is (2,0) and the goal position is (0,1).

Let's keep moving up. The position above us is (1,0). Moving up will put us one step closer to our goal.

Our next move will be to (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Our current position is (1,0) and the goal position is (0,1).

Let's analyze the options. We can't move right because of the wall, and moving down would take us away from our goal.

We can move up to (0,0) or try to move to the goal position (0,1) directly by moving diagonally up and right, but since diagonal moves are not allowed, we will move up to (0,0).

Our next move will be to (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Our current position is (0,0) and the goal position is (0,1).

It looks like we've finally reached the same row as the goal. Now we just need to move one step to the right.

Our next move will be to (0,1), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) L-shape

The empty spaces form a clear L-shape that connects the starting position (P) to the goal position (G).

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and has a recognizable L-shape formed by its empty spaces.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: SUCCESS
