You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since we can only move to empty spaces that are adjacent to our current position, let's take a look at the neighbors of our current position.

We are currently at (4, 1), marked by 'P'. The empty spaces near us are at (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), and (4, 4). However, we want to move towards the goal position (0, 1), marked by 'G'. Moving up seems like the most logical direction to make progress.

So, my next move will be to (3, 1). However, that space is a wall (1), and we cannot move there. Let's look at the alternatives again.

A good first step to make progress towards the goal without hitting a wall would be to move to the left. The coordinates of my next move will be (4, 0).

Please provide the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've successfully moved to (4, 0).

Now that I'm at (4, 0), my options for the next move are to move up, right, or stay in the same row. Since my ultimate goal is to reach (0, 1), I want to get closer to the top of the maze.

Moving up seems like the most logical direction to make progress. The space directly above me is at (3, 0). However, I must consider that there is a wall to the right of that position.

My next move will be to (3, 0). Please provide the updated maze after this move.

Note: If (3, 0) is not a valid move (in case I misinterpreted the maze), my alternative move would be to (4, 1). But I'm confident that (3, 0) is an empty space.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've successfully moved to (3, 0).

Now that I'm at (3, 0), my only option for the next move is to move up, since the spaces to the right and below are walls, and moving down would take me further away from the goal.

The space directly above me is at (2, 0). My next move will be to (2, 0). Please provide the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've successfully moved to (2, 0).

Now that I'm at (2, 0), my next move will be to (1, 0). The space directly above me is an empty space, so I can move up.

My next move will be to (1, 0). Please provide the updated maze after this move.

This will bring me closer to the goal position (0, 1). I'll reassess the situation once I've moved up to determine the best course of action.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, a valid path from P to G, and an L-shaped corridor:

0 G 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 P 0 1 1

This new maze has an L-shaped corridor, similar to the original maze, but with a different configuration of walls and empty spaces. The path from P to G can be navigated through the empty spaces.
