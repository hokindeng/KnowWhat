You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since we're at the current player position (P), which is at coordinates (4,1), our goal is to move towards the goal position (G) at coordinates (0,1).

The most direct path seems to be moving the player up. However, there are walls blocking our way. A closer inspection reveals that we can move the player to the left or right first to avoid the walls.

Given the current maze layout, the most logical next move would be to move the player to the left, towards the empty space. This will allow us to move closer to the goal while avoiding the walls.

The coordinates of the next move would be (4,0).

Here's the updated maze to reflect the new position:


0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

Please let me know if I'm correct, or if I need to adjust the plan!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since we're now at the leftmost edge of the maze (coordinates (4,0)), we can't move left anymore. Our goal is still to reach the goal position (G) at coordinates (0,1). To get closer to the goal, we need to move up.

Unfortunately, there are walls above our current position, so we can't move up directly. However, we can move to the right to find an opening to move up.

Given the current maze layout, the most logical next move would be to move the player to the right, towards the next empty space. This will allow us to search for an opening to move up.

The coordinates of the next move would be (4,1) is taken by our previous position, so the next available space would be (4,2) but there is a space at (4,1) that has a wall directly above it which we cannot use to go up however there is also another space immediately adjacent to the current player position which is to the right of the player so instead of moving two steps to the right let's choose instead to just move one step to the right the adjacent empty space.

The coordinates of the next move would be (4,1).

Here's the updated maze:


0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back to the original position!

Since we've already been in this position before, we can recall that moving directly up is not possible due to the walls. We can move to the right, but that won't help us get closer to the goal. Instead, let's try to create a new path by moving the player to the right and then finding an opening to move up.

However, since our previous move to the right didn't help, let's try moving to the right again, but this time, we'll move further to the right. We can move the player to the right, towards the next empty space.

The coordinates of the next move would be (4,2).

Here's the updated maze:


0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Let's see if this move helps us find a way up!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we've moved the player to the right, we've created some space to move further.

Since moving directly up is still not possible, our goal is to find a way to move up without hitting the walls. The only possible direction to move is to the right, towards the next empty space.

The coordinates of the next move would be (4,3).


0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we've moved the player to the right again, we've reached the edge of the block of walls above.

Since moving directly up is still not possible, our goal is to find a way to move up without hitting the walls. The only possible direction to move is to the right again, towards the next empty space.

The coordinates of the next move would be (4,4).


0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We've reached the rightmost edge of the maze!

Since moving directly up is still not possible from our current position, and we can't move to the right anymore, the only possible direction to move is to the left.

However, moving to the left won't help us get closer to the goal. We need to move up, but the walls are blocking our way.

Let's think about this... Since we've reached the edge of the maze, we can start moving back to the left and try to find an opening to move up. But that would mean retracing our steps.

Wait, I have an idea!

Since we're at the edge of the maze, we can try to move up and see if there's a way to get around the walls from the right side.

The coordinates of the next move would be (3,4).

Let's see if this move helps us find a way up!

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would say that the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a "U" shape.


Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:


G 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 P


This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and forms a recognizable "U" shape with its corridors. It's not an identical copy of the original maze, but it shares the same general shape.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
