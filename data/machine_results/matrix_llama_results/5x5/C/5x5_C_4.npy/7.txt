You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. The player is currently at position (4,1) and the goal is at position (0,1). Since the player can only move through empty spaces, the optimal path would be to move around the wall of 1's.

Considering the current position, I will move the player to the right to position (4,2). This move will bring the player closer to the edge of the wall and set up for further movement upwards.

My next move is to (4,2).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that the player is now at position (4,2).

My next move would be to move the player up to position (3,2). This move will continue to navigate around the wall of 1's and bring the player closer to the goal position.

My next move is to (3,2).

Please update the maze accordingly.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path" that wraps around the wall of 1's.


Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:


0 0 0 0 G
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

In this new maze, the player starts at the bottom left corner (4,0) and the goal is at the top right corner (0,4). The empty spaces form an L-shape that allows the player to navigate from the start to the goal while avoiding the walls.
