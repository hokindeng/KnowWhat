You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. The player is currently at position (4,1) and the goal is at position (0,1). Since the player can only move through empty spaces, the goal is to find a path that avoids the walls (represented by '1').

The next move should be to move up to position (3,1), but since there is a wall at that position, that's not possible. Instead, I will move the player to the right to position (4,2).

So, my next move is to position (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm glad I was able to move to the new position successfully.

From my current position (4,2), my next goal is to try to move up. However, there is a wall at position (3,2), so that's not possible. Instead, I will move the player to the right to position (4,3).

So, my next move is to position (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (4,3), my next goal is to try to move up. However, there is still a wall at position (3,3), so that's not possible. Instead, I will move the player to the right to position (4,4).

So, my next move is to position (4,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've reached the right edge of the maze.

From my current position (4,4), I will now move the player up to position is not possible due to the walls. Since I've reached a dead end on this path, I need to backtrack to find a possible solution.

I can move the player to the left, so my next move is to position (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (4,3), I'll continue backtracking. I will move the player to the left, so my next move is to position (4,2).

However, I can try to move up is not possible due to the walls, and I was at that (4,2) position previously and already explored the right path. My only viable option is to move the player to the left, so my next move is to position (4,1).

My overall plan is to backtrack to the initial position and then start exploring other paths.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, where the empty spaces form a recognizable L-shape:


0 0 0 0 G
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 1
P 0 0 0 0


This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The L-shape formed by the empty spaces is recognizable in this new maze.
