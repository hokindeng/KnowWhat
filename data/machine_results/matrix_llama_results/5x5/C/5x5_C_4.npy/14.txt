You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since we can only move to empty spaces that are adjacent to our current position, let's take a look at the positions around 'P'.

Our current position is at coordinates (4, 1), and the goal is at coordinates (0, 1). The spaces above and to the left of 'P' are blocked by walls, so we cannot move there. However, the space to the right of 'P' is an empty space.

Therefore, my next move would be to the right, to the coordinates (4, 2).

Please update the maze accordingly, and I'll plan the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the updated maze. Our current position is at coordinates (4, 2), and the goal is at coordinates (0, 1). Since we can't move up or left due to the walls, and we're already as far right as we can go without hitting a boundary, our only viable option is to move down.

However, there is no wall or boundary below us, and there is an empty space, so we can move down. My next move would be down, to the coordinates (not possible since it goes out of bounds), but we can move to the left and then down multiple times then left again to the goal. So my next move will be to the left, to the coordinates (4, 1).

Please update the maze accordingly, and I'll plan the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems we're back to the starting position!

Let's analyze the maze again. Since we can't move up due to the walls, and moving right would put us in a position we've already tried, our next option is to move down. However, we can't move down because that would put us out of bounds.

Our only viable option is to move to the left, but that would also put us out of bounds. Wait, no! We can actually move down the middle empty column by first moving left and then down is out of the question, moving right three times, then we can move up four times. So my next move would be to the right, to the coordinates (4, 2), then another move to the right, and then another move to the right, till the G is reachable going up.

However, let's do this step by step, my next move would be to the right, to the coordinates (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back to this position again.

As planned earlier, we want to move to the right again to make progress. My next move would be to the right, to the coordinates (4, 3).

Let's move closer to the goal!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're making progress!

As planned earlier, we want to move to the right again to make even more progress. However, we also have the option to move up now since we have cleared the wall on the right side, and there are four empty spaces above us before the goal.

My next move would be up, to the coordinates (3, 3). This will bring us closer to the goal.

Let's move up!

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:


0 0 0 0 G
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0


This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape.
