You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan our next move. The player is currently at position (4,1) and needs to reach the goal at position (0,1).

My next move would be to move up from position (4,1) to position (3,1). However, since there is a wall at position (3,1), this move is not possible.

Instead, I will move right from position (4,1) to position (4,2), as it is an empty space.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

Since I'm now at position (4,2) and need to reach the goal at position (0,1), I'll try to move closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

I will move right from position (4,2) to position (4,3), as it is an empty space.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll plan my next move.

I'm currently at position (4,3), and the goal is still at position (0,1). I need to find a way to move up without hitting the walls.

Since there's a wall above me, I'll need to move around it. I will move right from position (4,3) to position (4,4), as it is an empty space.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

I'm currently at position (4,4), and the goal is still at position (0,1). I need to find a way to move up without hitting the walls.

Since the wall above me is quite long, I'll try to move around its right edge. However, that would mean moving further away from the goal, which is not ideal.

Instead, I'll try to move left and see if I can find an opening. I will move left from position (4,4) to position (4,3), as it is an empty space.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Back to position (4,3).

I'll reassess the situation. Since I couldn't find an opening above, I'll try to move around the wall from the other side. I will move left from position (4,3) to position (4,2), as it is an empty space.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm back at position (4,2).

Since moving up is still not possible, I'll continue moving left to see if I can find an opening. I will move left from position (4,2) to position (4,1), as it is an empty space.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at the starting position (4,1).

It seems that I've explored the possibilities of moving right, and now I should focus on moving up. However, the wall above me is too long to move directly up.

Since the goal is at position (0,1), my next move will be to try to move up and left, closer to the goal. I will move up is not possible, but I can move left and then try to move up, to navigate around the wall. However, to move left from here would require me to have moved left from (4,0) which is currently blocked by the P position being at (4,1), which can be circumvented by moving left after rising one row.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "U-shaped" or "Crescent-shaped"

The empty spaces in the original maze form a U-shaped or crescent-shaped corridor that connects the starting position (P) to the goal position (G).

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shaped or crescent-shaped corridor:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

This new maze meets the criteria:

* It has the same size as the original maze (5x5)
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as a U-shaped or crescent-shaped corridor.
