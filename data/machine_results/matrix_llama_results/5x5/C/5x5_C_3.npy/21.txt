You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To solve the maze, I will employ a basic strategy aimed at moving closer to the goal 'G' while avoiding walls.

My current position 'P' is at coordinates (4,1). 

To move towards the goal 'G', which is located at (2,0), I should try to get closer to it by moving up or left. Since moving directly up is blocked by a wall, I will plan a route that involves moving left and then finding a path up. 

Therefore, my next move will be to the left, to the coordinates (4,0).

Next move coordinates: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've successfully moved to (4,0). 

My current position 'P' is now at coordinates (4,0). 

Now, to move closer to the goal 'G', I need to move up. There's an empty space directly above me, so my next move will be up to the coordinates (3,0).

Next move coordinates: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've successfully moved to (3,0). 

My current position 'P' is now at coordinates (3,0). 

To move closer to the goal 'G', I need to move up again. There's an empty space directly above me is not available since it's blocked by a wall, but there's a 'G' above and to the left is not an option, but to the right there is an empty space that can be used in a future move, in my next move I will move up is not an option, to the right to coordinates (3,1) is also not an option, I will move to the right to the coordinates (3, is not possible for now) ...up also is not possible for now.

To move closer to the goal I would be more near if I move up... but its blocked. lets go right for future possibilities
 but its blocked also... the only available move that I see for now is, to move down and try to find another route. I will move down and update my coordinates to (4,0)

Next move coordinates: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've successfully moved to (4,0). I've been here before!

My current position 'P' is now at coordinates (4,0). 

Since I couldn't move up or right previously, I'll now try to move to the right, to the coordinates (4,1), to see if I can find another route to the goal 'G'. 

Next move coordinates: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've successfully moved to (4,1). 

My current position 'P' is now at coordinates (4,1). 

To move closer to the goal 'G', I need to move up. However, since the direct path up is blocked by a wall, I will move further to the right to see if there's a possible route up. My next move will be to the right, to the coordinates (4,2).

Next move coordinates: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've successfully moved to (4,2). 

My current position 'P' is now at coordinates (4,2). 

I will continue to try to find a way up. Since the path up from my previous positions was blocked, I will move up from my current position to check if it's possible. However, I notice that the position above me, (3,2), is an empty space '0', and the position to the left of that, (3,1), is a wall, and the position to the left of that, (3,0), is an empty space below the 'G'. 

Considering my current position and the positions above, my next move will be up to (3,2).

Next move coordinates: (3,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "L-shape" or " L-formed corridors"

The empty spaces in the original maze form an L-shape, with two perpendicular corridors that meet at the corner.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape, and there is a valid path from P to G that can be reached through these corridors. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it meets the criteria specified.
