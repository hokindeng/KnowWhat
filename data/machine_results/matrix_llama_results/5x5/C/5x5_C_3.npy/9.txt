You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (4, 1), marked with 'P'. My goal is to reach the position marked with 'G' at (2, 0).

Looking at the adjacent positions of the current player position, I see that I can move up to (3, 1) or right to (4, 2). Moving up would put me closer to the goal, and since (3, 1) is an empty space, my next move would be to (3, 1).

However, before confirming the move, let's ensure that moving up doesn't put me in a situation where I would be surrounded by walls or unable to reach the goal. Since the space above me (3, 1) is empty and allows for potential future moves towards the goal, this move seems valid.

Therefore, my next move will be to the position (3, 1).

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome. 

Move coordinates: (3, 1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) L-shape

The empty spaces form a path that resembles an L-shape, first moving vertically and then horizontally towards the goal.

To generate a new maze with the same shape, I created the following:

(2) New Maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
G 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape, allowing the player to move from the starting position (P) to the goal position (G). Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it maintains the same general shape and a valid path from P to G.
