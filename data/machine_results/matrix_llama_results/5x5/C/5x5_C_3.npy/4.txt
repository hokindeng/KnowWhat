You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To solve the maze, I will employ a basic strategy since the maze is not very large. I will aim to move closer to the goal position 'G' step by step, avoiding walls and utilizing the empty spaces.

My current position is at 'P', located at coordinates (4,1), since the top-left corner is (0,0). 

To move closer to 'G', which is located at coordinates (2,0), I need to go up and then to the left. However, since moving directly to the left is blocked by a wall, my first move should be up to utilize the empty space.

Therefore, my next move will be to go up from (4,1) to (3,1).

Here are the coordinates of my next move: (3,1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is an "L" shape, since you can visualize the corridors as forming a rough L when viewed as a whole.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an "L" shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1

This maze meets the criteria by having the same size, a valid path from P to G, not being an identical copy, and maintaining an "L" shape formed by its empty spaces.
