You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right. The coordinates of the current player position are (4, 1). I will move to (4, 2).

The new coordinates of my position will be (4, 2).

Here's my reasoning skill for choosing this move: 

1. I analyzed the maze to find a path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G).
2. I considered all the adjacent positions that I can move to from my current position and picked the one that seems to be most likely to lead to the goal.
3. I avoided moving into a wall (represented by '1') as that would be an invalid move.
4. I chose to move right to (4, 2) as that is an empty space (represented by '0'), which is a valid move.

The updated maze will be:


1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 1 1

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will make my next move up. The coordinates of the current player position are (4, 2). I will move to (3, 2).

The new coordinates of my position will be (3, 2).


Here's my reasoning skill for choosing this move: 

1. I analyzed the maze to find a path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G).
2. I considered all the adjacent positions that I can move to from my current position and picked the one that seems to be most likely to lead to the goal.
3. I avoided moving into a wall (represented by '1') as that would be an invalid move.
4. I chose to move up to (3, 2) as that is an empty space (represented by '0'), which is a valid move and brings me closer to the goal.

The updated maze will be:


1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 P 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze:


1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1

(1) I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "Staircase" or an "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same staircase shape:


1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
P 1 1 0 1
