You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To solve the maze, I will employ a basic strategy since the maze is not very large. I will aim to move closer to the goal position (G) at each step while avoiding walls.

The current player position is (4, 1), and the goal is at (2, 0).

For my first move, I will move left from (4, 1) to (4, 0), because this moves me closer to the goal by reducing the distance on the x-axis, and there are no obstacles in the way.

My next move's coordinates are (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (4, 0). Since my objective is to reach the goal (G) at (2, 0) and there's an empty space above me, I will move up.

My next move's coordinates are (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (3, 0). I still want to move closer to the goal (G), which is now just one space above me. However, I have to be careful because there's a wall to the right of the goal. But since there's no wall directly above me, I can move up to the goal.

My next move's coordinates are (2, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "staircase" or more specifically, a "descending staircase".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


1 1 1 1 1
G 0 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 1


The empty spaces in this new maze also form a descending staircase shape, but the layout is not identical to the original maze. The player position (P) and goal position (G) are placed at different locations, and the walls are rearranged while maintaining the same overall shape of the corridors.
