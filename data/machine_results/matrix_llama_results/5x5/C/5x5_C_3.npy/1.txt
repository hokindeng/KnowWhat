You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To start, I will identify the coordinates of the current player position (P) and the goal position (G). The coordinates are as follows:
- P: (4, 1)
- G: (2, 0)
My objective is to move closer to the goal position (G). I can move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent empty space. Since I want to move closer to G and there is an empty space above my current position, my next move will be to move up.
The coordinates of my next move are (3, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and let me know the new state of the maze.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is an "L" shape, as there is a vertical path that turns into a horizontal path that leads to the goal.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form an L shape:


1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
