You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at the bottom, second column from the left, with coordinates (4, 1). To move towards the goal 'G', which is located at the top, we should move up. However, there is a wall directly above the current position, so we cannot move straight up. We need to move around it.

A possible next move is to move right, to the empty space adjacent to the current position, which is at coordinates (4, 2). 

So, the next move would be to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I am now at position (4, 2). To continue moving towards the goal 'G', I should move up. There is an empty space above me, so I can move up to the position (3, 2).

However, notice that there is a wall above that position, at (2, 2) and also to the left at (3, 1), so I would be blocked if I moved up. It is better to move left first and then up. Let's move left to position (4, 1), no, that would backtrack, so let's try another left to (4,0) and then we can move up to (3,0).

So, the next move would be to (4,0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag path" or a "winding stair".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zig-zag path:

1 1 0 1 1
1 G 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
0 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1

In this new maze, the path from P to G has a similar winding stair shape, but the maze is not an identical copy of the original. The empty spaces form a zig-zag path that allows the player to navigate from the starting position P to the goal position G.
