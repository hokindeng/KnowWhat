You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 2) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (3, 0). 

Since I can only move in the up, down, left, or right direction to an adjacent empty space, my next move would be to move left to the empty space at coordinates (0, 1).

My next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I am now at coordinates (0, 1) and my goal 'G' is at coordinates (3, 0).

My next move would be to move left again to the empty space at coordinates (0, 0).

My next move is to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at coordinates (0, 0), my next move would be to move down to the empty space at coordinates (1, 0), but that would put me into a wall (represented by the 1 at the current coordinates (1, 0) is not permissible).

Instead, I should try moving in another direction. I'll move right to the empty space at coordinates (0, 1), but I've already been there and don't want to get stuck in an infinite loop.

Another option is not permissible as there is a 1 (wall) at that location.

My next best move is to keep searching the top row for another empty space to move to that would allow me progress towards my goal.

My next move is to (0, 3) -third space to the right from my current position and is within the allowed movement direction from my current location

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path", with a long corridor along one edge and a turn to reach the goal.

Here is a new maze with the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shape:
```
P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1
0 0 0 0 0
```
Note that this new maze has a similar L-shape formed by the empty spaces, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The path from P to G can be reached through the empty spaces, and the maze has the same size as the original.
