You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 2) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (3, 0). 

My first move will be to the left, to the empty space at coordinates (0, 1).

So, my next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the current state of the maze, my next move will be to the left again, to the empty space at coordinates (0, 0).

So, my next move is to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've reached the leftmost edge of the maze. Now, I need to move downwards to approach the goal position.

My next move will be to the empty space below the current position, at coordinates (1, 0).

So, my next move is to (1, 0), but wait, there's a wall at (1, 0) due to the '1' in the maze, and the space immediately below that also has a wall at (2,0) so I need to move more than one step below. Let me correct my next move.

Since I'm at (0, 0) and I can't move down to (1, 0) or (2,0)  or (3,0),  I will move to the right.


Wait. I'll try to move to the bottom left most empty space that isn't blocked so (4,0) then move left to get to (3,0)
My next move is to (1, 0) nope to the same x coordinate but all the way down past the one right above the goal to (4, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 0

This new maze has the same size as the original and features an L-shaped corridor formed by the empty spaces, allowing for a valid path from P to G.
