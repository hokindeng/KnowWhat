You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 2) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (3, 0). 

My first move will be to the left, as there is an empty space ('0') adjacent to the current position in that direction.

My next move will be to coordinates (0, 1).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (0, 1).

My next move will be to the left, as there is an empty space ('0') adjacent to the current position in that direction.

My next move will be to coordinates (0, 0).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (0, 0).

My next move will be down, as there is no empty space to the left, and the space to the right leads to a wall ('1'). I will try to find a path to the goal position 'G' by moving down.

My next move will be to coordinates (1, 0).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (1, 0), but the space below me is empty ('0').

My next move will be to coordinates (2, 0) is not possible as I don't see the location (2,0) having an empty adjacent to my right position containing the (P) since is full of (1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (2, 0). The only possible move is down, as there are walls ('1') to the right and I came from the space above.

My next move will be to coordinates (3, 0), which is the goal position 'G'.

Please confirm if I have solved the maze!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "rectangle" or a " channel" that connects the starting position 'P' to the goal position 'G'.

(2) Here's a new maze with the same size and a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces, forming a similar rectangular or channel shape:


0 0 0 P 1
0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1


In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar channel or rectangular shape, allowing the player to move from the starting position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape formed by the empty spaces.
