You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position (0,2).

Current maze:
0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Since my current position is (0,2) marked with 'P', I will move to the empty space on my left at (0,1).

Next move coordinates: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,1), I can move down to the empty space at (1,1), but that would put me into a wall. Alternatively, I can move left to the empty space at (0,0).

Next move coordinates: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,0), I want to move down to the empty space below. However, there is a wall at (1,0). The only available move is to move right to the empty space at (0,1).

Next move coordinates: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back to this position. Since I'm at (0,1) and the path to the goal is still blocked by walls on the right and below, I can try moving right to the empty space at (0,2) or move left to the empty space at (0,0) which we've already tried. Let's try moving right to the empty space at (0,2) and see if it opens up any new possibilities.

Next move coordinates: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,2) again, I'll move right to the empty space at (0,3).

Next move coordinates: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I'm at position (0,3) now, moving right would put me into a wall. Instead, I can move down to see if there's a path. However, there's a wall below at (1,3). I can try moving left to (0,2) which we've already tried. Alternatively, I can keep moving down to other rows by moving left to an empty space on the same row where I can move down. However, the empty space available on the left at (0,2), and before that, is not having an empty space below. There is one more empty space left at (0,0) but that also doesn't have an empty space below. Let me move to the leftmost empty space with empty space below. Let's move down using that leftmost empty space ( column 0). Let's start moving left (0,2), (0,1), (0,0).

Next move coordinates: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at position (0,2). Now, let's move left to (0,1), and from there, I can move left again to (0,0).

Next move coordinates: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm at position (0,1). Now, let's move left to (0,0).

Next move coordinates: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,0) again, I've exhausted all horizontal moves and need to think of a way to move down. However, there's a wall below at (1,0). The entire row 1 is blocked. Let's look at row 2: also blocked. Row 3 is blocked except for the goal (G). Row 4 has empty spaces. The column I'm currently in (column 0) has an empty space in row 4. I can move down to row 4.

Next move coordinates: (4,0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "U-shape" or " U-like shape"

The corridors form a U-like shape, with the open ends at the top and bottom of the maze. The path from P to G can be traversed by moving down through one side of the U and then up through the other side.

Here is a new maze of the same size that forms a U-like shape with its empty spaces:

0 P 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 0

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original. The empty spaces in this maze also form a U-like shape, with the open ends at the top and bottom.
