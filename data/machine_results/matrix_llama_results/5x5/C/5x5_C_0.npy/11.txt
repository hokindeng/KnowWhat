You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position (P) is at coordinates (0, 2).

Since the goal position (G) is at coordinates (3, 0), we need to move down and then left to reach it. However, we cannot move directly down because there is a wall (1) in the way. We need to move to an adjacent empty space first.

A possible next move is to move left to the empty space at coordinates (0, 1). This will give us more options for the subsequent moves.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the current state of the maze, I can move down to the empty space at coordinates (1, 0), but that would not help much since there is a wall (1) below it. A better option would be to move down and left is not possible. I will move P down is not possible.

So the next best move is to move left and the P is already at the left most possible move so the only option is to move P down.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the current state of the maze, I can see that the path down is blocked by walls. However, I notice that there is an empty space to the left of my current position, but that will take me further from G so I won't do that.

A possible next move is to move down is not an option but moving right is also not a viable option because of the wall (1). My next best move would be to move left but that also isn't helpful here since my last move was down. Thus my next best moves are moving left three more times so that once I can move down I can do so without running into the wall.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size, encoding, and shape (L-shape):

0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 0 0
1 0 0 0 1

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, has a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and has an L-shaped corridor formed by the empty spaces.
