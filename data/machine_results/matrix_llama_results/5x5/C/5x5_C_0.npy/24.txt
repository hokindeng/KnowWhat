You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (0, 2), marked by 'P'. The goal position is at (3, 0), marked by 'G'. 

I will examine the surroundings of the current player position and try to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. 

Since I can move up, down, left, or right, I will choose the most suitable move.

Move 1: I will move the player to (0, 1), as it is an empty space (0) adjacent to the current position.

Please update the maze to reflect this move. The new maze should look like this:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the updated maze for further analysis.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

From the current position (0, 1), I see that I can move to (0, 0) which is an empty space adjacent to the current position. This move is in the direction towards the goal.

Move 2: I will move the player to (0, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect this move. The new maze should look like this:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the updated maze for further analysis.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

From the current position (0, 0), I want to move towards the goal, which is at (3, 0). However, I see that I am blocked by a wall of '1's starting from (1, 0) to (3, 0). I need to find an alternative path.

I notice that I can move down to (1, 0), but it's blocked. I also notice that I can move right to (0, 1), (0, 2), or (0, 3), and then try to find a path downwards.

Move 3: I will move the player to (0, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect this move. The new maze should look like this:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

However, I would like to see an alternative to moving right. Is it possible for me to explore other options by allowing me to undo this move in case it leads to a dead end?

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue from here.

Since I've moved to (0, 1), my next step is to try and find a way to move downwards. However, the direct path downwards is blocked by the wall of '1's.

I'll try to move further right to see if I can find an opening. 

Move 4: I will move the player to (0, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect this move. The new maze should look like this:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the updated maze for further analysis.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

Since I've moved to (0, 2), my next step is to try and find a way to move downwards. However, the direct path downwards is blocked by the wall of '1's.

I'll try to move further right to see if I can find an opening. 

Move 5: I will move the player to (0, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect this move. The new maze should look like this:

0 0 0 P 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the updated maze for further analysis.



 Let's see where this move takes me.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

I've moved to (0, 3), and the direct path downwards is still blocked by the wall of '1's. However, I notice that the entire bottom row, except for the last column, is empty (0 0 0 0). 

I'll try to move down to the bottom row and then move left towards the goal. 

Move 6: I will move the player to (1 is blocked, 2 is blocked, 3 is blocked, and 4 is blocked. So, I have to move all the way down to) (4, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect this move. The new maze should look like this:

0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 1

Please provide the updated maze for further analysis.



This should take me closer to the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "U-shaped" corridor.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same U-shaped corridor:


0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 1
P 0 0 0 1

Note that the new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it maintains the same U-shaped corridor structure. The player (P) can navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal (G).
