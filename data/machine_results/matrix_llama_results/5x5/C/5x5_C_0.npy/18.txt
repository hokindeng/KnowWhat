You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since we're currently at position 'P', which is at (0,2), our goal is to move towards 'G' at (3,0).

A suitable next move would be to move up, but since we're already at the top row, that's not possible. Instead, we can move left to (0,1) or right to (0,3). However, moving right would put us into a dead-end situation due to the wall at (0,4). So, the best move is to go left.

The coordinates of my next move are (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since we're now at position (0,1), our next goal is to move towards 'G' while avoiding the walls.

Looking at the maze, we can see that the top row is clear, so we can try to move left again to (0,0) to create more movement options.

The coordinates of my next move are (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We've reached the leftmost edge of the maze.

Now that we're at position (0,0), our only viable option is to move down to (1,0). This will bring us closer to the goal and create new movement opportunities.

The coordinates of my next move are (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We've moved down to (1,0).

Unfortunately, moving down again would put us into a wall. Moving up would take us back to our previous position, which we want to avoid. Moving right would also put us into a wall. So, our only viable option is to try moving down again, but in a later step, after some additional movement. Instead, we can move left, but that is not possible as we are already at the left edge. We are in the only possible position we can be at this row, now we should move down at a later step. 

In order to move down we must move to the row below at a later step. Looking at the maze we see that the wall extends three spaces to the right. Let's move down to row 3 below after first moving right three spaces.

Our first move is to move to the right. The coordinates of my next move are (1,1), no we cannot go there - that is a wall, we move right and our next move is (1,2) no - that is also a wall we have to go further right our next move is to the right at (1,3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "U-shape".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
G 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is also a U-shape. The path from P to G is valid and can be reached through the empty spaces. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original maze.
