You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (0, 2), marked by 'P'. My goal is to reach the position (3, 0), marked by 'G'. 

After examining the maze, I notice that there's only one possible direction to move initially - to the left. 

So, my next move will be to the left, to the coordinates (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (0, 1), marked by 'P'. My goal is to reach the position (3, 0), marked by 'G'.

Since I am closer to the left edge, my only viable option is to move down to the next row. However, I notice that the position directly below me is a wall (1). 

So, my next move will be to the left, to the coordinates (0, 0), which is an empty space (0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (0, 0), marked by 'P'. My goal is to reach the position (3, 0), marked by 'G'.

Since I am currently at the top-left corner of the maze, my only viable option is to move down to the next row. 

So, my next move will be down, to the coordinates (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (1, 0), marked by 'P'. My goal is to reach the position (3, 0), marked by 'G'.

Since I am in the second row and there is a wall to my right, my only viable option is to move down to the next row where there is an empty space. However, there isn't a free path downward. I must move to a column where a down move will be possible in the future.

My next move will be to wait at this position and then when it is possible move down. So I'll wait for a turn and I will just move down to the coordinates (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (2, 0), marked by 'P'. My goal is to reach the position (3, 0), marked by 'G'.

Since I am closer to the goal now and the space directly below me is the goal position itself, I can finally move down to the goal position.

My next move will be down, to the coordinates (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L-shape" or "Elbow shape", since it consists of a straight vertical path that turns into a horizontal path.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1
P 0 0 0 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape that connects the starting position 'P' to the goal position 'G', while avoiding walls. Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape and characteristics.
