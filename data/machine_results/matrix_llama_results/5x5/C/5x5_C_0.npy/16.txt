You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 2) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (3, 0). 

Since I can only move in the up, down, left, or right direction, my next step will be to move to an empty space. 

From my current position 'P' at (0, 2), I can move to the empty space at (0, 1). This seems like a reasonable next step to explore the maze while avoiding the wall to the right.

My next move is to coordinates (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position 'P' at (0, 1), I can see that I can move up to coordinates (0, 0), which is an empty space.

My next move is to coordinates (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at the top row, I need to move down to get closer to the goal 'G'. Since there's a wall below me at (1, 0), I'll move down and to the left isn't an option, so I'll move to the right to potentially find a path down. I see an empty space at (0, 1).

However, I've already explored the area to the right, and I don't want to move in circles, I want to try to move down. I'll choose to move down to coordinates (1, 0), no, that's not an option. Then, my next move is to coordinates (0, 1) no, that's backwards. I will move to the far right and down through the empty left channel of the last column. I can move down to coordinates (4, 0) later and then continue left.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "U-shape".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 P 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a U-shape that connects the start position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original, but the shape of the corridors is recognizable as a U-shape.
