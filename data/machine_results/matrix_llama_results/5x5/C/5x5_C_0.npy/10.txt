You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 2) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (3, 0). 

My first move will be to the left, as there is an empty space ('0') to the left of the current position.

I will move to coordinates (0, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (0, 1).

My next move will be to the left, as there is another empty space ('0') to the left of the current position.

I will move to coordinates (0, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (0, 0).

Since there is a wall ('1') directly below my current position, I will try to move down and to the left as little as possible, then move right in subsequent turns, to go around the wall.

My next move will be downward to coordinates (1, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (1, 0).

My goal is to move down and reach the goal 'G', but there is a wall to the right. I'll try to move down again to get closer to 'G'.

My next move will be downward to coordinates (2, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (2, 0).

I still need to move down to reach 'G'. Since the path is clear directly below, I will move downward.

My next move will be downward to coordinates (3, 0), which is the goal position 'G'.

Please let me know if I have solved the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size as the original, where the empty spaces form an L-shape:


0 0 0 P 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1

This new maze has a valid path from 'P' to 'G' that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is an L-shape, similar to the original maze, but with a different configuration.
