You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position (0, 2), marked by 'P'. My goal is to reach position (3, 0), marked by 'G'. To get there, I will try to move to an adjacent empty space.

Looking at the maze, I can see that the only possible move from my current position is to the left, to the empty space at position (0, 1).

So, my next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position (0, 1), marked by 'P'. My goal is to reach position (3, 0), marked by 'G'. To get there, I will try to move to an adjacent empty space.

Looking at the maze, I can see that the only possible move from my current position is to the left, to the empty space at position (0, 0).

So, my next move is to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at position (0, 0), marked by 'P'. My goal is to reach position (3, 0), marked by 'G'. To get there, I notice that I can move down to position (1, 0), but it's blocked by a wall. However, I can move to the right to position (0, 1) which would take me back to a previous position, or I can try to move further to the right to explore other possible paths.

Since moving right doesn't seem to provide any new opportunities, I will explore moving down. But, as I said, I am blocked by a wall. I will move right once and then hopefully be able to move down.

So, my next move is to (0, 1), however I noticed that this position was previously visited so I'm hoping I can immediately move down afterwards to a new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at position (0, 1), marked by 'P'. My goal is to reach position (3, 0), marked by 'G'. As I previously mentioned, my plan was to move right once to explore other possible paths. Since the walls block me from moving down from my current position and the positions to the right of me, I'll move down at the rightmost available position.

However I notice that on my rightmost available position which is at (0, 4) there is a wall. So my plan now is to move to the last empty space before the wall, which is at position (0, 3), and then hopefully find an opportunity to move down afterwards.

So, my next move is to (0, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path".


Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:


0 P 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1


This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape.
