You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. 

I see that the current player position is at coordinates (0,2), as that is where the 'P' is located. The goal is at coordinates (3,0), as that is where the 'G' is located. 

Since we can only move in the up, down, left, or right direction, and we need to avoid walls ('1'), the next move should be to an adjacent empty space. Let's examine the adjacent spaces:

* Up: The position above is at (0,1), but it is an empty space ('0'). However, moving up would not bring us closer to the goal, so this might not be the best move.
* Down: The position below is at (1,2), which is a wall ('1'). So, moving down is not possible.
* Left: The position to the left is at (0,1), which is an empty space ('0'). This could be a viable option.
* Right: The position to the right is at (0,3), which is an empty space ('0'). However, there is a wall ('1') just after it, which could make the next moves difficult.

Considering the options, my next move would be to coordinates (0,1), as it is an empty space and will allow for further moves to reach the goal.

Please update the maze according to my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I see that the maze has been updated to reflect the new player position.

From the current position (0,1), I will analyze the adjacent spaces:

* Up: There is no space above, as we are at the top edge of the maze.
* Down: The position below is at (1,1), which is a wall ('1'). So, moving down is not possible.
* Left: The position to the left is at (0,0), which is an empty space ('0'). This could be a viable option, but it would move us away from the goal.
* Right: The position to the right is at (0,2), which is an empty space ('0'). This could also be a viable option.

Considering the options, my next move would be to coordinates (0,2), as it is an empty space and will allow for further moves to reach the goal, potentially creating more opportunities to move downwards.

However, since we previously moved from (0,2) to (0,1), this might not be the most efficient move. A more efficient strategy could be to move left to (0,0) and then down to (1,0), which would get us closer to the goal.

After reconsidering, my next move is to coordinates (0,0). This move will allow us to move downwards in the next step.

Please update the maze according to my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0,0), I will analyze the adjacent spaces:

* Up: There is no space above, as we are at the top edge of the maze.
* Down: The position below is at (1,0), which is an empty space ('0'). This looks like a promising move to get closer to the goal.
* Left: There is no space to the left, as we are at the left edge of the maze.
* Right: The position to the right is at (0,1), which is an empty space ('0'). However, moving right would not bring us closer to the goal.

Considering the options, my next move would be to coordinates (1,0), as it is an empty space and will get us closer to the goal.

Please update the maze according to my next move.

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1,0), I will analyze the adjacent spaces:

* Up: The position above is at (0,0), which is an empty space ('0'). However, moving up would move us away from the goal.
* Down: The position below is at (2,0), which is an empty space ('0'). This looks like a promising move to get closer to the goal.
* Left: There is no space to the left, as we are at the left edge of the maze.
* Right: The position to the right is at (1,1), which is a wall ('1'). So, moving right is not possible.

Considering the options, my next move would be to coordinates (2,0), as it is an empty space and will get us closer to the goal.

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2,0), I will analyze the adjacent spaces:

* Up: The position above is at (1,0), which is an empty space ('0'). However, moving up would move us away from the goal.
* Down: The position below is at (3,0), which is the goal ('G'). This is the final destination!
* Left: There is no space to the left, as we are at the left edge of the maze.
* Right: The position to the right is at (2,1), which is a wall ('1'). So, moving right is not possible.

Considering the options, my next move would be to coordinates (3,0), as it is the goal and the final destination.

Please confirm if this is the correct final move!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "staircase" or an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same staircase or L-shape:


1 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
0 1 P 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar staircase or L-shape, and there is a valid path from P to G that can be reached through the empty spaces. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original maze.
