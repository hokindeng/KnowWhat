You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 2) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (3, 0). 

My first move will be to move left to the empty space at coordinates (0, 1) since moving up or right would lead to a wall or out of bounds. 

So, my next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I am now at coordinates (0, 1) and my goal remains at coordinates (3, 0). 

Since the top row is clear to the left, I'll move left to the empty space at coordinates (0, 0), getting closer to the top-left part of the maze.

So, my next move is to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at coordinates (0, 0), my goal is still at coordinates (3, 0), which is directly down. 

However, I notice that there's a wall at coordinates (1, 0), so I won't be able to move straight down. Since the top row is still clear to the right, I'll explore other paths by moving down when possible.

For now, I'll move right to the empty space at coordinates (0, 1) and try to find a path down later.

However, considering the initial setup and looking ahead to future moves, a better move seems to be to move right further to (0, 3) then down. To do that, I can start by moving right to the empty space at coordinates (0, 1) then I will reassess.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at coordinates (0, 1), I can continue with my plan to move to the right. 

I will move right to the empty space at coordinates (0, 2), and then assess the situation again to see if I can move down or need to go further right.

However, as my goal is to reach (0, 3) before moving down I will instead move to (0, 3) directly.

My next move is to (0, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or " Corner path".

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:
 
0 1 1 0 P
1 1 0 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
G 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 0 1

This maze has the same size as the original, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is also an "L-shape" or "Corner path", but it's not an identical copy of the original maze.
