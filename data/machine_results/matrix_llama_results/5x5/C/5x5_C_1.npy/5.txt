You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To start solving the maze, I'll identify the current position of the player and the goal, and then decide the best direction to move.

Current player position (P) is at (3,1).
Goal position (G) is at (1,3).

Considering the maze layout, the best initial move would be to move up from the current position, as moving down or to the right would hit a wall, and there is no space to the left.

My next move's coordinates will be (2,1).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved up to (2,1). The next best move would be to move up again, which would take me to the same row as the goal, but one step to the left of it, or move right to try and navigate around the wall to reach the goal directly.

I will choose to move up.

My next move's coordinates will be (1,1).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1,1), the goal position (G) is to my right, and there are no walls in the way.

My next move's coordinates will be (1,2).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1,2), I'm just one step away from the goal.

My next move's coordinates will be (1,3).

Please update the maze accordingly.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) an "L-shape" or an "elbow shape", with a horizontal and a vertical segment connected at a right angle.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 P 1
1 G 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form an L-shape, but the position of the player (P) and the goal (G) have been swapped, and some walls have been rearranged to create a new, distinct maze. The maze has the same size as the original, and there is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces.
