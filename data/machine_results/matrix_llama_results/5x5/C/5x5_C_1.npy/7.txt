You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position (P) is at (3,1). The goal position (G) is at (1,3).

My first move will be to move up to the empty space above the current position. The new coordinates will be (2,1).

Please update the maze and provide the new state.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the current position (P) at (2,1) and the goal position (G) at (1,3), my next move will be to move up and to the right is blocked, so I'll just move up to the empty space above the current position. The new coordinates will be (1,1).

Please update the maze and provide the new state.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting closer to the goal. With the current position (P) at (1,1) and the goal position (G) at (1,3), my next move will be to move right to the empty space next to the current position. The new coordinates will be (1,2).

Please update the maze and provide the new state.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Almost there! With the current position (P) at (1,2) and the goal position (G) at (1,3), my next move will be to move right to the goal position. The new coordinates will be (1,3).

Please update the maze and provide the new state. I hope this will be the final move!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

For the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as an "L-shape".


Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 P 1
1 G 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1

This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
