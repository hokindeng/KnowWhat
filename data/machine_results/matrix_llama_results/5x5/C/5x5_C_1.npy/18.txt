You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To solve the maze, I will aim to find the shortest path to the goal 'G'. 

First, I will identify the current player position 'P', which is at coordinates (3,1). 

Then, I will evaluate the adjacent positions to determine the next move. The possible moves from 'P' are up, down, left, or right. 

- Moving up: The position above 'P' is at (2,1), which is a wall '1'. So, moving up is not possible.
- Moving down: The position below 'P' is at (4,1), which is an empty space '0'. So, moving down is a possible move.
- Moving left: The position to the left of 'P' is at (3,0), which is a wall '1'. So, moving left is not possible.
- Moving right: The position to the right of 'P' is at (3,2), which is a wall '1'. So, moving right is not possible.

Therefore, the best next move is to move down to the empty space at coordinates (4,1).

Next move coordinates: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved down to (4,1), I'll re-evaluate the adjacent positions to determine the next move. 

The possible moves from the current position (4,1) are up, down, left, or right.

- Moving up: The position above 'P' is at (3,1), which is an empty space '0'. So, moving up is a possible move.
- Moving down: There is no position below 'P' as we are already at the bottom of the maze. So, moving down is not possible.
- Moving left: The position to the left of 'P' is at (4,0), which is a wall '1'. So, moving left is not possible.
- Moving right: The position to the right of 'P' is at (4,2), which is an empty space '0'. So, moving right is a possible move.

Since the goal 'G' is above the current position, I'll choose to move up to get closer to the goal. Therefore, the best next move is to move up to the empty space at coordinates (3,1).

Next move coordinates: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved up to (3,1), I'll re-evaluate the adjacent positions to determine the next move. 

The possible moves from the current position (3,1) are up, down, left, or right.

- Moving up: The position above 'P' is at (2,1), which is an empty space '0'. So, moving up is a possible move.
- Moving down: The position below 'P' is at (4,1), which is an empty space '0' but we just came from there. Moving down is not necessary.
- Moving left: The position to the left of 'P' is at (3,0), which is a wall '1'. So, moving left is not possible.
- Moving right: The position to the right of 'P' is at (3,2), which is a wall '1'. So, moving right is not possible.

Since the goal 'G' is above the current position, I'll choose to move up to get closer to the goal. Therefore, the best next move is to move up to the empty space at coordinates (2,1).

Next move coordinates: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved up to (2,1), I'll re-evaluate the adjacent positions to determine the next move. 

The possible moves from the current position (2,1) are up, down, left, or right.

- Moving up: The position above 'P' is at (1,1), which is an empty space '0'. So, moving up is a possible move.
- Moving down: The position below 'P' is at (3,1), which is an empty space '0' but we just came from there. Moving down is not necessary.
- Moving left: The position to the left of 'P' is at (2,0), which is a wall '1'. So, moving left is not possible.
- Moving right: The position to the right of 'P' is at (2,2), which is an empty space '0'. So, moving right is a possible move.

Since the goal 'G' is to the right and above the current position, I can try to move right and then up to get closer to the goal. Therefore, the best next move is to move right to the empty space at coordinates (2,2).

However, moving up to (1,1) and then planning to go right is a better approach, so I will move up instead. 

Next move coordinates: (1,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved up to (1,1), I'll re-evaluate the adjacent positions to determine the next move. 

The possible moves from the current position (1,1) are up, down, left, or right.

- Moving up: The position above 'P' is at (0,1), which is a wall '1'. So, moving up is not possible.
- Moving down: The position below 'P' is at (2,1), which is an empty space '0' but we just came from there. Moving down is not necessary.
- Moving left: The position to the left of 'P' is at (1,0), which is a wall '1'. So, moving left is not possible.
- Moving right: The position to the right of 'P' is at (1,2), which is an empty space '0'. And the goal 'G' is just one more step to the right. So, moving right is the best move.

Therefore, the best next move is to move right to the empty space at coordinates (1,2).

Next move coordinates: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved right to (1,2), I'll re-evaluate the adjacent positions to determine the next move. 

The possible moves from the current position (1,2) are up, down, left, or right.

- Moving up: The position above 'P' is at (0,2), which is a wall '1'. So, moving up is not possible.
- Moving down: The position below 'P' is at (2,2), which is a wall '1'. So, moving down is not possible.
- Moving left: The position to the left of 'P' is at (1,1), which is an empty space '0' but we just came from there. Moving left is not necessary.
- Moving right: The position to the right of 'P' is at (1,3), which is the goal 'G'. So, moving right is the best move to reach the goal.

Therefore, the best next move is to move right to the goal at coordinates (1,3).

Next move coordinates: (1,3)

This should be the final move, and the maze should be solved.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) L-shape

The empty spaces form a distinctive L-shape that connects the starting position 'P' to the goal 'G'.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 G
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G', is not an identical copy of the original, and forms the same L-shape with its empty spaces.
