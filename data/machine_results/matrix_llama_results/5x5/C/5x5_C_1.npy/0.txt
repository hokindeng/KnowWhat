You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am starting at the position of 'P', which is at (3,1). The goal 'G' is located at (1,3). To move closer to the goal without hitting any walls, my first step will be to move up.

Therefore, my next move will be to the position (2,1), which is an empty space. The coordinates are:

Row: 2
Column: 1

So, my move is (2,1). Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I've moved to the position (2,1).

To progress further towards the goal 'G' at (1,3), my next move will be to the left. The adjacent empty space is at (2,0), but since it is not available (there's a wall to the left), I will try moving up instead.

However, moving up is also not possible because of the wall. So, my next move will be to the right, which is not a viable long-term strategy but I have to get out of this situation first. The empty space to the right is not available because of the wall, so I must move down.

My next move will be to the position (3,1).

Row: 3
Column: 1

So, my move is (3,1). Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved back to the position (3,1).

From this position, I'll try again to get closer to the goal 'G'. To move up towards the goal, I need to move up to the position that was previously occupied, which is (2,1). Since this move was previously successful, and nothing in the maze has changed that affects this particular move, I will move up again.

My next move will be to the position (2,1).

Row: 2
Column: 1

So, my move is (2,1). Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved back to the position (2,1).

Since I've reached this position again, I can reassess the situation. This time, I'll try to move to the left, but it's blocked by the wall. Moving up is also not possible due to the wall. So, I'll try to move right, but it's also blocked by the wall. The only viable option is to move to the left of the wall above me, but first, I have to get there.

My next move will be to the leftmost empty space above, but first I need to go up to the row (1,1) by going left and then up, so I need to get into the column of the row above. I will move to the leftmost available position on my current row. The leftmost available position on my current row is (2,0), but the space to my left is blocked by the wall.

However I see a space, two spaces to my right at (2,3) that is blocked from every direction, except if I move there by going  down and left twice and up twice which won't happen, and the position at  (1,3), to which this case may be a candidate.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "cross" or "plus" shape, with horizontal and vertical corridors intersecting in the middle.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape of empty spaces:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 P 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 G 0 1

This maze has the same "cross" or "plus" shape of empty spaces as the original maze, with a valid path from P to G that can be reached through the empty spaces. It is not an identical copy of the original maze, and it meets all the specified criteria.
