You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position (3, 1), marked as 'P'. My goal is to reach position (1, 3), marked as 'G'. To get closer to my goal, I will move to an adjacent empty space.

After analyzing the maze, I have decided to move up. My new position will be (2, 1), which is an empty space. 

So, the coordinates of my next move are (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my new position at (2, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal.

I'll analyze my surroundings and see that I have empty spaces to my left and up. Since my goal is to the top-right, I will move up to get closer.

My new position will be (1, 1).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my new position at (1, 1), I see that I'm getting closer to the goal. I notice that I have an empty space to my right, and it's adjacent to the goal.

I will move right to get closer to the goal.

My new position will be (1, 2).

However, I see that moving to (1, 2) will put me in a good position to move directly to the goal on the next turn. I will therefore choose to move to (1, 2).

But I want to move right again in the following turn so I can reach the goal.

So, the coordinates of my next move are indeed (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm so close to the goal now.

With my current position at (1, 2) and the goal being at (1, 3), I can see that I can move directly to the goal.

My new position will be (1, 3), which is the goal 'G'.

So, the coordinates of my next move are (1, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A roughly L-shaped path

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shaped path:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it still has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shaped path.
