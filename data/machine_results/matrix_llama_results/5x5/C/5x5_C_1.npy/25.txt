You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position (P) is at (3,1). The goal position (G) is at (1,3).

My first move will be to move up to the empty space above the current player position. The new coordinates will be (2,1).

So, my next move is to (2,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (2,1). My goal is still to reach (1,3). Since there's an empty space to the left, I'll move left. The new coordinates will be (2,0).

However, I realize that moving left won't get me closer to the goal. I should move up to get closer to the goal. The space above me is empty, so I'll move up. The new coordinates will be (1,1).

So, my next move is to (1,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (1,1). The goal is adjacent to my current position, two steps to the right, at (1,3). Since the space to my right is empty, I can move right. I'll move one step to the right. The new coordinates will be (1,2).

So, my next move is to (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (1,2). The goal is right next to me, at (1,3). Since the space to my right is the goal, I'll move right. The new coordinates will be (1,3).

So, my next move is to (1,3). This should be the final move to reach the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner shape". This is because the empty spaces form a continuous path that resembles an L or a corner, connecting the starting point (P) to the goal (G).

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 P 1 1 G
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape, similar to the original maze. However, this maze is not an identical copy of the original, and the path from P to G is different.
