You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (3, 1) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (1, 3).

To start moving towards the goal 'G', I'll move up from the current position 'P' since it's the most direct way. 

My next move will be to the coordinates (2, 1). 

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved up to (2, 1) successfully.

Now, I'll try to move left from my current position to get closer to the goal 'G'. However, since there's a wall to the left at (2, 0), I'll move to the right instead isn't an option either, due to the wall at (2, 2). So, I'll move up to (1, 1).

My next move will be to the coordinates (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved up to (1, 1) successfully.

Now, I'll try to move right from my current position to get even closer to the goal 'G'. There's an empty space to the right at (1, 2), and then the goal is just one more move to the right.

My next move will be to the coordinates (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved right to (1, 2) successfully.

Now, I'll try to move right from my current position to reach the goal 'G'. There's an empty space (or rather, the goal itself) to the right at (1, 3).

My next move will be to the coordinates (1, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "7" or an "L" shape, but more broadly, it can be classified as a " Bent Tunnel" or an "L-shaped Corridor".

(2) Here's a new maze with the same size, a valid path from P to G, and the same general shape formed by its empty spaces:


1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1

This new maze has a bent tunnel or L-shaped corridor, just like the original maze. However, the path from P to G and the placement of the walls are different.
