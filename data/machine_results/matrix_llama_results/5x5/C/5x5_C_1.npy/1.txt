You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position (3,1) which is directly to the right of my current position (3,0), as it is an empty space. 

However, the maze uses 0-based indexing, so the current position of the player is at (3,0). The player should move up to get closer to the goal. The new position of the player will be (2,0) and then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), and then finally (1,3) which is the goal position.

My first move will be to (2,0) and then proceed from there.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "T-shaped" or "cruciform" shape.

Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same T-shaped or cruciform shape:


1 1 0 1 1
1 P 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a T-shaped or cruciform shape, similar to the original maze. However, it is not an identical copy of the original maze.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
