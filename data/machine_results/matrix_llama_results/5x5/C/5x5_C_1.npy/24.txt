You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by identifying the current player position (P) and the goal position (G). The current player position is at (3, 1) and the goal position is at (1, 3).

To navigate from the current player position to the goal position, I will try to move up to the empty space at (2, 1). 

My next move is to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will try to move up again to the empty space at (1, 1). However, I notice that there's also an empty space at (2, 0), but moving there will lead me away from the goal. So, moving up is a more promising direction.

My next move is to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1, 1), I'll try to move right to the empty space at (1, 2) to get closer to the goal. This will put me in a good position to eventually reach the goal at (1, 3).

My next move is to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting close to the goal. Now that I'm at (1, 2), I'll try to move right again to the goal position at (1, 3).

My next move is to (1, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) an "L-shape" or "elbow shape", since it consists of two approximately perpendicular corridors that form an L-like shape.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 P 1
1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original. The empty spaces (corridors) in this new maze also form an L-shape. Note that the L-shape is oriented differently than in the original maze, but it is still recognizable as the same general shape.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
