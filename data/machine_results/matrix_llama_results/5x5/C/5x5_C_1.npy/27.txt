You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To start solving the maze, I'll identify the current position of the player and the goal, and then determine a feasible next step.

The player is currently at (3,1) since the top-left corner is (0,0), and we count rows and columns starting from 0. The goal is at (1,3).

A good approach is to try and move closer to the goal. Since I am currently at (3,1) and the goal is at (1,3), my next move should ideally reduce the distance between these two points. However, I need to ensure that I move to an empty space.

Given the maze's current state and my position at (3,1), my only possible move to reduce distance to the goal without hitting a wall is to move up. 

Therefore, my next move is to the position (2,1).

However, considering the immediate surroundings, moving directly up would put me into a wall. The description of the maze around my current position is:

- To the left at (3,0) is a wall (1).
- Above at (2,1) is a wall (1).
- To the right at (3,2) is also a wall (1).
- Below at (4,1) is an empty space (0), which is the only feasible immediate move.

Correcting my analysis for the mistake regarding the direct upward move being obstructed by a wall, the correct and feasible next move from (3,1) would indeed be downwards to (4,1), moving into the empty space.

Thus, my corrected move is to (4,1).

Please update the maze accordingly and provide the new state of the maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I am now at position (4,1). My goal remains the same: to navigate to the goal 'G' at (1,3).

From my current position at (4,1), I can see that moving directly up towards the goal is still impeded by walls. However, moving to the right might eventually offer a pathway up. Given the immediate surroundings:

- To the left at (4,0) is a wall (1).
- Above at (3,1) is a wall, which is not an immediate option for direct upward movement.
- To the right at (4,2) is an empty space (0), presenting a feasible move.
- Below is not applicable since I am at the bottom edge of the maze.

Therefore, a rational next move would be to the right, aiming to eventually find a path that allows me to move upwards towards the goal.

My next move is to the position (4,2).

Please update the maze accordingly and provide the new state of the maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze and my new position at (4,2), I'll reassess my next move. My ultimate goal remains reaching 'G' at (1,3).

Considering my immediate surroundings:

- To the left at (4,1) is an empty space, which I previously occupied.
- Above at (3,2) is a wall (1), blocking direct upward movement.
- To the right at (4,3) is an empty space (0), which seems like a viable option for movement.
- Below is not applicable since I am at the bottom edge of the maze.

Given these conditions, moving to the right could potentially open up future paths or even align me vertically with the goal for a direct upward path if the maze's upper layers allow it.

My next move is to the position (4,3).

Please update the maze accordingly and provide the new state of the maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4,3), I'm directly below the goal's column but still several rows away due to the walls. Considering my immediate surroundings:

- To the left at (4,2) is an empty space.
- Above at (3,3) is a wall (1), so I still can't move directly up.
- To the right at (4,4) is a wall (1), which isn't an option.
- Below is not applicable since I am at the bottom edge of the maze.

Since moving directly up is not possible and moving to the right is blocked by a wall, my next logical move would be to backtrack slightly to the left, aiming to find an opening upwards in the columns to the left of my current position. This might help me navigate around the obstacles and eventually reach the goal.

My next move is to the position (4,2).

Please update the maze accordingly and provide the new state of the maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at position (4,2), my previous assessment of the surroundings still stands, but I also recall that moving up directly from here isn't an option due to the wall above at (3,2).

Given the familiar surroundings:

- To the left at (4,1) is an empty space.
- Above at (3,2) is a wall (1), blocking direct upward movement.
- To the right at (4,3) is an empty space, which I previously occupied and didn't lead to an immediate solution.
- Below is not applicable since I am at the bottom edge of the maze.

Since I've explored moving to the right and it didn't immediately help, and moving directly up is blocked, my next move will be to the left, potentially allowing me to explore paths that could have been overlooked or to find a way up through the left column.

My next move is to the position (4,1).

Please update the maze accordingly and provide the new state of the maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now back at position (4,1), and given my previous explorations and the fact that I've hit a wall trying to move directly up from various positions in the bottom row, I recognize that I might have to backtrack further to find a viable path up.

Considering my immediate surroundings:

- To the left at (4,0) is a wall (1), which isn't an option.
- Above at (3,1) is a wall (1), which has been a consistent obstacle.
- To the right at (4,2) is an empty space, which I've explored before.
- Below is not applicable since I am at the bottom edge of the maze.

Since I've explored the right path and direct upward movement is not possible, and moving to the left isn't an option due to the wall, I must consider the overall structure of the maze again and look for any potential oversight.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that in the context of this specific maze problem, we're tasked with finding a path but are also somewhat limited by the information provided directly around the player and the goal. Given the format, let's re-evaluate the apparent options for movement:

1. **Assess the entire maze layout again:** It seems I've understandably overlooked paths due to the focus on direct movement towards the goal and the limitation of viewing the maze from the player's perspective. Given the maze structure, one must consider potential pathways from the goal to the player and find a suitable meeting point.

2. **Possible Oversight:** Upon reassessment, considering paths I might have overlooked, I see the potential pathway to the goal involves navigating through the empty spaces above my current position in a different manner than I initially attempted.

Considering this, I must plan a move that could potentially align me with a viable path upward or allow for re-exploration of parts of the maze that were overlooked in the initial strategy. However, given the current situation, without more explicit paths upwards or towards the goal from my current position, the immediate next step based on the initial directive might involve a degree of trial and error or a reconsideration of prior movements to identify any overlooked opportunities.

Given this analysis and recognizing the format requires a direct move, the immediate avenues I previously considered are blocked or have been explored, leading me to reconsider how I approach identifying a viable next step within the constraints provided.

However, as per the problem constraints and to follow the procedure exactly as requested, I need to suggest a move based on the immediate surroundings, given I've explored right and moving left is blocked, and considering the reflective analysis.

Given this context, the suggested next move to fulfill the response format requirement, albeit in a scenario where an immediate viable upward path is not visible from the current position and involves a degree of backtracking or reconsideration of the overall maze layout, would typically involve revisiting previous positions or attempting to align with a known pathway, which might not be directly achievable from the current state without additional steps or revisiting prior positions for a different path.

But to adhere strictly to the required format and based on the reflective analysis, without additional immediate options:

My next move is to the position (4,2).

Please update the maze accordingly and provide the new state of the maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now back at position (4,2). Given that I've explored various paths and recognizing the structure of the maze, I notice that there's a potential pathway towards the goal that I haven't fully explored, primarily due to the walls blocking direct upward movement.

However, upon re-assessment, I realize that to progress, I might need to re-trace some steps and explore alternative paths that I might have overlooked. The immediate surroundings are familiar:

- To the left at (4,1) is an empty space.
- Above at (3,2) is a wall (1), blocking direct upward movement.
- To the right at (4,3) is an empty space, which I've visited before.
- Below is not applicable since I am at the bottom edge of the maze.

Given the situation, I will attempt to move upwards by finding an alternative path. Since direct upward movement from my current position is blocked, I need to explore other possible paths that might allow me to move closer to the goal.

Considering the structure of the maze and potential pathways, one option is to attempt to find a way around the wall that blocks my direct upward movement. This means exploring positions that could allow me to navigate around obstacles and find a path upwards.

However, given my current understanding and the moves I've made so far, I need to reflect on the maze layout to identify any potential paths that I might have overlooked.

In the context of the current situation and given the structure of the maze, without additional immediate options that directly move me closer to the goal:

My next move is to the position (4,1).

Please update the maze accordingly and provide the new state of the maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now back at position (4,1), and after reassessing the maze layout and considering the potential paths, I realize that I've been focusing on moving right and then trying to move up, which hasn't led to a solution.

Given my current position and the maze layout:

- To the left at (4,0) is a wall (1), which isn't an option.
- Above at (3,1) is a wall (1), blocking direct upward movement.
- To the right at (4,2) is an empty space, which I've explored before.
- Below is not applicable since I am at the bottom edge of the maze.

However, looking at the maze layout, I notice that the goal is actually positioned at (1,3), and the wall that blocks my direct upward movement is only one column wide. This means that if I can move up at a different column, I might be able to find a path towards the goal.

Given this realization, I'm going to try a different approach.

My next move is to the position (4,0) isn't an option, and (3,1) is blocked, I will choose to go up the left path eventually. However, since I can only move up from left one slot from my position which is walled I am forced back to make this one attempt up if the maze changes.


My next move is (3,0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "Zig-Zag" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "Zig-Zag" shape:


1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 1

This new maze meets the criteria, with a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces, and the general shape of the corridors forming a "Zig-Zag" pattern.
