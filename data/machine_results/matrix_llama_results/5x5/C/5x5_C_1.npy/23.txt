You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (3, 1), and the goal position is at (1, 3). The shortest path to the goal seems to be moving upwards.

My next move will be to the position (2, 1), which is an empty space directly above the current player position.

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 1)

Please provide the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2, 1), my next move will be to the left, since the upward path is blocked by a wall.

My next move will be to the position (2, 0) but that is blocked by a wall as well so instead I will make my next move to (1, 1), which is an empty space directly above and to the left is blocked.

No instead I make my next move to (1,1)


However coordinate  (1,1) would be correct  other option will be (2,0) so my first choice was correct 

Instead The coordinates of my next move are: (1,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1, 1), my next move will be to the right, as the goal position (G) is nearby.

My next move will be to the position (1, 2) then to (1,3) which is the goal however lets ignore (1,3) first 

However my next move will be to an empty space that is (1,2)


The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1, 2), the goal position (G) is just one step to the right.

My next move will be to the position (1, 3), which is the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 3)

This should be the final move to solve the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A "Staircase" or an "L-shape" shape, as it forms a continuous path with a right angle turn.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "Staircase" or "L-shape" shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

This new maze meets the criteria:

* Same size as the original maze
* Includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
* Not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as a "Staircase" or "L-shape" shape.
