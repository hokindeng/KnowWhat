You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position (3, 1), marked as 'P'. My goal is to reach position (1, 3), marked as 'G'. To do this, I need to move up. The space above me is empty (at position (2, 1)), so I will move up.

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position (2, 1), marked as 'P'. My goal is still to reach position (1, 3), marked as 'G'. To do this, I need to move up. However, I also notice that the space above and to the right of me is also empty, but since I need to move up first to potentially reach G more quickly I will move up.

The space above me is at position (1, 1) and it is empty, so I will move up.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at position (1, 1), marked as 'P'. My goal is still to reach position (1, 3), marked as 'G'. To do this, I can move right, since the space to the right of me is empty and it will bring me closer to the goal.

The space to the right of me is at position (1, 2), and it is empty, but I will actually need to move two spaces right. I will make the first move right.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at position (1, 2), marked as 'P'. My goal is still to reach position (1, 3), marked as 'G'. I am now right next to the goal, and the space to the right of me is the goal itself.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag" or an "S-shape".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zig-zag shape:


1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 0 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original. The empty spaces form a zig-zag shape, similar to the original maze.
