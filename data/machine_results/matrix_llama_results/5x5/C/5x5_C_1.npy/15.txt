You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To solve the maze, I will apply a pathfinding approach. Since I can only move up, down, left, or right, I'll examine the possible adjacent empty spaces to the current player position 'P' at coordinates (3,1).

The possible moves are:
- Up: (2,1) is an empty space '0'.
- Down: Not possible since it's out of the maze bounds.
- Left: Not possible since it's blocked by a wall '1'.
- Right: Not possible since it's blocked by a wall '1'.

Given the options, the best move is to go up to (2,1). 

Please update the maze to reflect this move and present it again for further navigation. My move is to coordinates (2,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I'll plan my next move. I am currently at coordinates (2,1). Examining the adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: (1,1) is an empty space '0'.
- Down: (3,1) is an empty space '0', but I just came from there, so I'll avoid backtracking.
- Left: Not possible since it's blocked by a wall '1'.
- Right: Not possible since it's blocked by a wall '1'.

The best move is to go up to (1,1), getting closer to the goal 'G'. 

Please update the maze to reflect this move and present it again for further navigation. My move is to coordinates (1,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting close to the goal 'G'! Based on the updated maze, I'll plan my next move. I am currently at coordinates (1,1). Examining the adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: Not possible since it's blocked by a wall '1'.
- Down: (2,1) is an empty space '0', but I already explored that path, so I'll focus on the goal.
- Left: Not possible since it's blocked by a wall '1'.
- Right: (1,2) is an empty space '0' and (1,3) is the goal 'G'!

The best move is to go right to (1,2) and then I'll aim for the goal 'G'. 

Please update the maze to reflect this move and present it again for further navigation. My move is to coordinates (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm right next to the goal 'G'! Based on the updated maze, I'll make my final move. I am currently at coordinates (1,2). The goal 'G' is at coordinates (1,3). 

I'll move right to (1,3) and reach the goal 'G'! 

Please confirm that I've solved the maze. My move is to coordinates (1,3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A " serpentine" or a winding path with a distinctive L-shape, rotated 90 degrees.

Here is a new maze with the same size as the original, with empty spaces forming a similar serpentine shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 P 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1

This new maze has a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and has a general shape formed by its empty spaces that is recognizable as a serpentine shape.
