You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Current player position (P) is at coordinates (3,4), and the goal position (G) is at coordinates (2,2). Since I can move in any of the 8 directions (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal) to an adjacent empty space, I will try to move closer to the goal.

My next move will be to move diagonally up-left to coordinates (2,3). However, I see that position (2,3) is a wall ('1'), so I will move left to coordinates (3,3), which is an empty space ('0'). 

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

The coordinates of my next move are (3,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

I am currently at coordinates (3,3). To reach the goal position (G) at coordinates (2,2), I will try to move closer. The position directly above me is a wall ('1'), so I will look for alternative moves.

I notice that I can move diagonally up-left to coordinates (2,2), which is the goal position. However, I can also move up-left to the coordinates adjacent to the goal position, but it is a wall and I also can't reach it by moving just up, because of the wall, and moving left would only bring me further from the goal position. So, my only move is moving diagonally up-left to the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a 'cross-shaped corridor'. The empty spaces in the maze form a cross-like shape that connects the starting point 'P' to the goal point 'G'.

Here is a new maze with the same size (5x5) and a cross-shaped corridor:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
0 0 G 0 0
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 P 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a cross-shaped corridor that connects the starting point 'P' to the goal point 'G'. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it meets the criteria of having the same size, a valid path from 'P' to 'G', and a recognizable cross-shaped corridor.
