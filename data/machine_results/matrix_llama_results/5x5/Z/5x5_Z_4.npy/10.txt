You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at (3,4) and the goal position is at (2,2).

To navigate from the current player position to the goal position, we need to move diagonally up-left to avoid the walls. The nearest empty space to (3,4) that leads towards the goal is (2,3).

My next move would be to (2,3) and then I'll reassess the updated maze.

Coordinates of next move: (2,3)

Please update the maze and provide the new grid.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A Staircase or a Zigzag shape.

The empty spaces form a winding path from the bottom-right to the top-left, with a zigzag or staircase-like pattern.

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

1 1 0 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 G 1
0 0 1 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and features a zigzag or staircase-like shape formed by its empty spaces.
