You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at (3,4) and the goal position is at (2,2).

To navigate from the current player position to the goal position, we need to move left and up. The most direct path would be to move diagonally left and up, but let's consider the adjacent empty spaces first.

A good next move would be to move left to the empty space at (3,3). This move avoids walls and brings us closer to the goal position.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (3,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (3,3). Now I need to continue moving towards the goal position. Since the goal position is at (2,2), I should move up and left.

A good next move would be to move diagonally up and left to the empty space at (2,2), but since it's occupied by the goal, I'll aim for the adjacent empty space. However, there are walls above me, so I'll move left first to create a path for the next move.

The coordinates of my next move are: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 1 1
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (3,2). Now, I want to move up towards the goal. Since the space above me is a wall, I'll move diagonally up and left to avoid the wall.

However, this move is not possible. So, I'll try moving up and one space to the right to create an opportunity for the next move. Unfortunately, this space is also blocked by a wall.

My only viable option is to move up is not possible, but moving one space to the left is an option that could provide better opportunities on the next turn.

However, after rethinking the path, I could try moving diagonally in a different direction. I could try moving diagonally up and right to see if future opportunities arise.

The coordinates of my next move are not up, which as shown is not viable, but: (2,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A Zigzag or a Staircase shape.

The empty spaces form a zigzag path that connects the start position (P) to the goal position (G).

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 G 1 0
1 1 0 P 1
1 1 1 0 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a similar zigzag or staircase shape. The path from P to G is valid and can be reached through empty spaces. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a zigzag or staircase.
