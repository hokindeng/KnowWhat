You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at (3,4) and the goal position is at (2,2).

To get closer to the goal position, I would like to move up and to the left. Since diagonal moves are allowed, I can move to the space at (2,3). This space is empty and adjacent to the current player position.

My next move is to (2,3).

Please update the maze to reflect this new position and I will analyze it again to plan the next move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would say that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is an "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape that connects the starting position P to the goal position G. The maze is not identical to the original, but the shape of the corridors is recognizable as an L-shape.
