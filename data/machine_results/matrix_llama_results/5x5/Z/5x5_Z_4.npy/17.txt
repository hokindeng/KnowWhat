You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position (P) and the goal position (G)
The current player position (P) is at the coordinates (3, 4) and the goal position (G) is at the coordinates (2, 2).

## Step 2: Examine the adjacent spaces of the current player position
We can move up, down, left, right, or any diagonal from the current position. Examining the adjacent spaces, we can move up to (2, 4), left to (3, 3), or diagonally up-left to (2, 3) as these spaces are empty.

## Step 3: Choose the next move
Since our goal is at (2, 2), moving diagonally up-left to (2, 3) brings us closer to the goal position than moving up or left.

## Step 4: Provide the coordinates of the next move
Given the decision to move diagonally up-left, the coordinates of our next move will be (2, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
Upon examining the original maze, it appears that the empty spaces form a shape that resembles an "L" or a corner path. However, considering the diagonals and the overall structure, the shape formed by the empty spaces is more akin to a "staircase" or a "zigzag" pattern, but since the path from P to G is primarily through a corner turn, the shape could be best described as an "L-shape".

## Step 2: Generate a new maze of the same size with the same general shape formed by empty spaces
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it has the same size (5x5), includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and the empty spaces form an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 G
1 0 0 0 1
1 P 1 1 1

The final answer is:


1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 G
1 0 0 0 1
1 P 1 1 1
