You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Current player position (P) is at coordinates (3,4), and the goal position (G) is at coordinates (2,2). Since I can move in any of the 8 directions (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal) to an adjacent empty space, I will try to move closer to the goal.

My next move will be to move the player up to the empty space at coordinates (2,4).

So, my next move is: (2,4)

Please let me know if this is a valid move and provide the updated maze. I'll be happy to make the next move based on the updated maze.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a:

(1) Sigmoid or S-shape.

The empty spaces in the original maze form a curved, S-like path from the starting position (P) to the goal position (G).

Now, I will generate a new maze with the same size and shape characteristics. Here is the new maze:

1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 G 1
1 1 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar S-shape, providing a valid path from the starting position (P) to the goal position (G) through adjacent empty spaces. The maze is not identical to the original one, but it maintains the same size and shape characteristics.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
