You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Current player position (P) is at coordinates (3,4) and the goal position (G) is at coordinates (2,2). Since I can move in any of the 8 directions (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal) to an adjacent empty space, I will try to move closer to the goal.

My next move will be to the space directly above the current player position (P), which has coordinates (2,4). However, this space is a wall (1). So, I will choose the next best option.

I will move to the space to the left of the current player position (P), which has coordinates (3,3). Since this space is empty (0), my next move will be to (3,3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position. 

Next move coordinates: (3,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

I am currently at coordinates (3,3). To reach the goal position (G) at coordinates (2,2), I need to move closer to it.

I will move to the space above and to the left of the current player position (P), which has coordinates (2,2), but this space is the goal position (G), and I am not directly adjacent to it. However, I can try to get closer.

I will move to the space above the current player position (P), which has coordinates (2,3). Since this space is empty (0), my next move will be to (2,3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Next move coordinates: (2,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L-shape" (rotated 90 degrees clockwise). However, considering the connectivity between the empty spaces that lead from the start (P) to the goal (G), and considering that the player can move in any of the 8 directions, it is more accurate to describe the shape of the empty spaces as a "staircase" shape (or "stairstep" shape).

(2) Here is a new maze that meets the given criteria, with the same size as the original maze (5x5), a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and the same general "staircase" shape formed by the empty spaces:

1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 G 0 1
P 1 1 1 1
