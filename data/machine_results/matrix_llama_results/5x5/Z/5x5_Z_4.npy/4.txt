You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at (3,4) and the goal position is at (2,2).

To navigate from the current player position to the goal position, we need to move left and up. The most direct path would be to move diagonally left and up, but since the adjacent space is a wall, we'll move left first.

My next move would be to (3,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (3,3). Now I'll analyze the maze again. To get to the goal position at (2,2), I need to move up. However, the space directly above me is empty, so I can move up.

My next move would be to (2,3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would say that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is an "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 0 0
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 G 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape, and there is a valid path from P to G that can be reached through these empty spaces. The maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it shares the same general shape formed by its corridors.
