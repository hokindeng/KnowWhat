You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I see that the current player position (P) is at the coordinates (4,4) since Python uses 0-based indexing. I will try to move the player up one cell into the empty space. Therefore, the coordinates of my next move will be:

(4,3)

Please update the maze accordingly, and I will be happy to make my next move based on the new situation.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position (P) is now at the coordinates (4,2) or more specifically, (4,3) has been left and the '0' is now in (4,3) position, since we bumped the P up one spot from 4,4 to 4,3 and the 0 is bumped down, to be exact (the P is now at the third index). Given this updated maze, I will try to move the player to the left one cell into the empty space. Therefore, the coordinates of my next move will be:

(3,3)

However, that won't be my next move. I instead choose:
 
(4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position (P) is now at the coordinates (4,2) or more specifically, the 2nd index of the last row (remember: Python uses 0-based indexing). Given this updated maze, I will try to move the player up one cell into the empty space that appears two spaces above my current position, however since we cannot move 2 spaces I will instead try to move up 1. I notice there is a wall when moving up 1 space so I will choose an alternative route that is up one space and to the left one space, therefore, the coordinates of my next move will be:

(3,1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a:

(1) roughly "L"-shape

This is because the empty spaces in the original maze form an L-shape, starting from the bottom right and extending up and to the left.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:
```
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 P
```
This new maze has the same size as the original maze, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape. Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
