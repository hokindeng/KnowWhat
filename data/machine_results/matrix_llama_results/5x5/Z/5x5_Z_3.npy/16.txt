You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I see that the current player position 'P' is at the coordinates (4,4). Looking at the surrounding positions, I notice that I can move up to (3,4) or left to (4,3), as both positions are empty spaces.

Since my goal is to reach the position 'G' at (2,3), I decide to move left to get closer to the goal. 

The coordinates of my next move are (4,3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I see that the current player position 'P' is at the coordinates (4,3). Looking at the surrounding positions, I notice that I can move up to (3,3) or left to (4,2), as both positions are empty spaces, or I can move right to (4,4), which I previously occupied.

Since my goal is to reach the position 'G' at (2,3), I decide to move up to get closer to the goal. However, I see that position (3,3) is blocked by a wall. I also notice that position (3,2) and (3,4) are also blocked by walls. Therefore, the closest empty space I can move to that brings me closer to the goal is actually two spaces away: (2,2), (2,4), (3,1) and (3,5) are not empty. However, I can go two spaces left to position (4,1) in this turn or to position (4,2), getting closer to (3,1), since going left makes position (2,2) and position (3,1) more emphasized than right now.

Since position (2,2) is very important since I could move (1,1) up to (2,1) from position (2,2), the extra emphasis towards right doesn't quite weigh enough to counter a move which lets me reach a space which lets me clear a horizontal path with one action on the present call.

Considering this, I'll decide on making a move left 2 units towards (4,1) into a position I have no option but try to move up in the next step.

I apologize for the previous response. To clarify, my next move is to the coordinates (4,2). I will move one space to the left to get closer to the goal and potentially create a path to reach it.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I see that the current player position 'P' is at the coordinates (4,2). 

Looking at the surrounding positions, I notice that I can move up to (3,2), but that position is blocked by a wall. However, I can move left to (4,1), which is an empty space, or I can move right to (4,3), which I previously occupied, or move down is also not an option since I'm at the last row, also diagonals up are blocked, and right  upper diagonal to (3,3) is also blocked, only 3 options stay: right, left and lower right.

Since my goal is to reach the position 'G' at (2,3), I decide to move left to get closer to the open corridor and create an opportunity to move up in the next turn.

The coordinates of my next move are (4,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the current player position 'P' at the coordinates (4,1) and the goal 'G' at (2,3), I need to find a way to move up.

Since the positions directly above me (3,1) and diagonally up-right (3,2) are blocked by walls, my best option is to move up is through position (3,0) then (2,0) and from there I can move right.

However, as (2,0), (1,1), (2,1) and (1,0) all are good to go to (1,1) or position (2,1) from this new move it might take at least two turns minimally if we don't receive wall we will go that corridor, implicitly top without any understatement or reconsider recalling other shifting as eastern route connection and walking mostly blocked travels figuring other annihil new fast reactions decisions escalating to simulations )

To simplify, my next move is to remain at row 4, since moving up to row 3 isn't currently possible due to walls blocking my path. I will move right to column 2.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path with an extension".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape, allowing the player to move from the starting position "P" to the goal position "G". Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it retains the same general shape and structure of the corridors.
