You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To start solving the maze, I'll identify the current position of the player 'P', which is at the coordinates (4,4).

Looking at the adjacent cells, I can see that the cell directly above the player 'P', at coordinates (3,4), is a wall ('1'), which cannot be traversed. However, the cell diagonally up and to the left, at coordinates (3,3), is an empty space ('0').

My next move would be to the cell diagonally up and to the left of the player 'P', at coordinates (3,3).

Please update the maze with my new position and let me know the state of the maze after this move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) The shape of the corridors is roughly a "**U-shape**", with the empty spaces forming a curved path that connects the player's position to the goal position.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 G 0 1
1 1 0 0 0
1 P 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a U-shape that connects the player's position (P) to the goal position (G). The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it retains the same general shape and structure.
