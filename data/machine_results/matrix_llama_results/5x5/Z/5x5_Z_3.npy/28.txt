You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G', my first move will be towards the goal while avoiding walls and utilizing empty spaces for movement.

Given the maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 P

My current position 'P' is at (4,4). A good initial move would be to go up to (3,4), but since there's a wall at (3,4), I will choose to move diagonally to (3,3) if possible, or directly left to (4,3) if diagonal movement to an empty space is not available.

Since the maze does not explicitly state if diagonal movement to an empty space that is directly adjacent to the player and not blocked by a wall is allowed or if (3,3) is considered a valid destination, and to ensure I adhere to the format of providing coordinates for the next move that is clearly valid within the maze's restrictions, I will decide based on the explicitly allowed movements (up, down, left, right, and the understanding that diagonal moves into empty spaces directly adjacent might be included but focusing on safer choices given the constraints).

Given these considerations and looking at the maze, a safer initial move would be to move to (4,3) as it's clearly an empty space and moving left is one of the allowed movements.

So, the coordinates of my next move will be (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 P 0

My current position 'P' is at (4,2). The goal 'G' is located at (2,3). To move closer to the goal while avoiding walls, my next move should be to utilize one of the empty spaces that brings me closer to 'G'.

Given the layout, moving directly up is blocked by a wall, so my best option is to continue moving left to (4,1), as moving up or diagonally up-left immediately is not possible due to the wall at (3,2).

Thus, the coordinates of my next move will be (4,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze can be described as roughly forming a backwards 'L' shape with an extension or a hook at the end where 'G' is located. However, considering the overall connectivity and layout, it's a bit more complex. If we simplify the interpretation by focusing on the main path that connects 'P' to 'G', we could conceptualize it as having characteristics of a path that includes segments which resemble parts of an inverted 'L' or a stretched and bent 'T' when considering the segments separately.

However, if we were to simplify the categorization of the shape further and focus on the overall layout including the extension to 'G', it somewhat resembles or can be thought of in the realm of a complex hook or a purported upside-down 'L' with an added segment to it. But accurately, describing paths in mazes can get quite complex, and these descriptions try to approximate the general layout. For simplicity and based on the constraints of your question, let's conceptualize the main pathway as parts of a larger "hook-like" or a segment of a path resembling part of a "T" structure given its horizontal base and the extension up to the goal, 'G'.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size, where empty spaces form a somewhat similar hook-like or 'T'-part structure, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1

This maze maintains a path from 'P' to 'G' that can be traversed through empty spaces, forming a shape that can be conceptualized within the realms of a 'hook' or an inverted segment of a pathway, keeping with the chore characteristics described, though mirror-imaged and slightly varied to meet the task's requirements.
