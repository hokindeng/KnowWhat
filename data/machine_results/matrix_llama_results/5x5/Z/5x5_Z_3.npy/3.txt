You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I see that the current player position 'P' is at the coordinates (4,4). Looking at the surrounding positions, I notice that I can move up to (3,4) or left to (4,3), as both positions are empty spaces.

Since my goal is to reach the position 'G' at (2,3), I decide to move left to get closer to the goal. 

The coordinates of my next move are (4,3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I see that the current player position 'P' is at the coordinates (4,3). Looking at the surrounding positions, I notice that I can move up to (3,3) or left to (4,2), as both positions are empty spaces, or I can move diagonally up and left to (3,2).

Since my goal is to reach the position 'G' at (2,3), I decide to move up to get closer to the goal.

However, I notice that moving up directly to (3,3) would put me into a dead-end, as there are walls blocking the left and right sides. 

Considering this, I decide to move diagonally up and left to (3,2), to maintain my options and get closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are (3,2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I see that the current player position 'P' is at the coordinates (3,2) is blocked by walls and diagonals aren't a viable option. However, in the actual maze layout the position is (3,1) not (3,2) it seems I made an error. 

Given this situation, I decide to move up to (2,1) since my goal is to reach the position 'G' at (2,3), this would bring me closer to it.

The coordinates of my next move are (2,1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a rectangle with two extensions forming an inverted "L" or "gamma" shape (Γ-shape).

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and Γ-shape corridors:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 1 0

This maze has the same dimensions as the original, with a Γ-shaped path from 'P' to 'G' that can be reached through empty spaces. The maze layout is not identical to the original, but the empty spaces form a recognizable Γ shape.
