You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G', my first move will be towards the goal while avoiding walls and considering the movement options (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).

Currently, 'P' is at position (4,4). My next move will be to (4,3), which is an empty space ('0') adjacent to 'P'. The new coordinates for 'P' will be (4,3).

Please update the maze according to my move, and I'll plan the next step based on the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze. My current position 'P' is at (4,3), and the goal position 'G' is at (2,3). I need to move closer to 'G' while avoiding walls.

My next move will be to (3,3), which is not possible since it's a wall ('1'). I will explore other options. I can move to (4,2), which is an empty space ('0') and gets me closer to finding a path to 'G'.

The new coordinates for 'P' will be (4,2).

Please update the maze according to my move, and I'll plan the next step based on the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my current position 'P' at (4,2) and the goal position 'G' at (2,3), I will look for a path to move upwards while avoiding walls.

I notice that I can move to (3,2), but it's not possible since it's a wall ('1'). I'll explore other options. I can move to (4,1), which is an empty space ('0') and might help me find a way to get closer to 'G' later.

The new coordinates for 'P' will be (4,1).

Please update the maze according to my move, and I'll plan the next step based on the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my current position 'P' at (4,1) and the goal position 'G' at (2,3), I notice that I can move to the space directly above me, which is at (3,1), but it's a wall ('1'). I'll explore other options.

I can move to the space at (3, not an option, wall), or I can move left to (4,0), but that doesn't help. However, moving one position to the right to (4,0), I see I can move diagonally to (3,0), which is not helpful as it is a wall. However I can move diagonally up and left  from (4,1), to (3,0). Which is not possible.

Wait I actually think my best bet is to move diagonally in the opposite direction: diagonally up and right, to position (3,2), which isn't a viable move either due to the wall at that position.

My new best move is to move left then move up diagonally, so the coordinates of the intermediate move, my next move, is  to the left of (4,1), that is:  to position (4,0).

The new coordinates for 'P' after the initial left move, before going diagonally up will be (4,0).

Please update the maze according to my move, and I'll plan the next step based on the updated maze.



(Note asP the lower times height path isn't defined yet whereas at 4 we are able to access viable path available within certain length examples freeing it taşıy<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I'll make my move. To confirm, my next move is to the left, to position (4,0).

Please update the maze accordingly.

(Note: I'll plan the next step, possibly a diagonal move, based on the updated maze after this move.)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) The general shape is an "L-Shape" or a "corner" shape, consisting of two connected perpendicular corridors.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-Shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 G 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 0

This new maze meets the criteria:

* Same size as the original maze (5x5)
* Includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
* Not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces is an L-Shape or corner shape, similar to the original maze.
