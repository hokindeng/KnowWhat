You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. My current position is at the bottom center, and the goal is at the third row from the top, fourth column from the left. My immediate goal is to get closer to the goal without hitting any walls.

To move closer to the goal, I will first need to move up. The coordinates directly above me are (3, 3), but I should check if this space is empty before deciding. Given the maze structure:

- The row above my current position is "1 1 0 1 1".
- The third column from the left (index 2, as we start counting from 0) in this row is '0', which is an empty space.

Therefore, I will move up to this empty space, but I need to provide the coordinates based on a 0-indexed system. Since I'm currently at the bottom (which is row 4, column 3 if starting from 0), moving up would place me at row 3, and maintaining the same column (3), which I've verified is empty. Thus, my next move will be to coordinates (3, 3).

Answer: (3, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as roughly forming an "inverted L" or a "step shape". This is because there are two segments of corridors: one running horizontally at the top and one running vertically downwards after a certain point, with the connecting point allowing for movement between the horizontal and vertical segments.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming the same "inverted L" or "step shape". This maze maintains a valid path from P to G without being an identical copy of the original.

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 P
```

To fit the shape description, I've rearranged the walls and empty spaces so that the step-like structure is preserved, but the path now goes from the bottom to the goal position which I'll place at the original position for continuity:

``` 
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 P
```

This revised version maintains the "inverted L" or "step shape" while providing a different solution path than the original.
