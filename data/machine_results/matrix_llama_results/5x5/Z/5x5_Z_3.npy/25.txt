You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G', my first move will be towards the goal while avoiding walls and considering the movement options (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).

Currently, 'P' is at position (4,4). My next move will be to (4,3), which is an empty space ('0') adjacent to 'P'. The new coordinates for 'P' will be (4,3).

Please update the maze according to my move, and I'll plan the next step based on the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze. My current position 'P' is at (4,3), and the goal position 'G' is at (2,3). 

Considering the available movement options (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) and the maze structure, I'll move diagonally up towards the goal. My next move will be to (3,2), which is an empty space ('0') that brings me closer to 'G'. 

Please let me know the outcome of this move by updating the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, my current position 'P' is at (3,2). Considering the goal position 'G' is at (2,3), I need to move up and to the right.

My next move will be to (2,2), but that's a '1' (wall). So, I'll move to (3,3) instead, but that's also not possible because it's a '1' (wall) too. Moving down isn't an option because I'd be moving away from 'G'.

However, moving diagonally up and right would put me at (2,3), but since it's the goal 'G' and not an empty space, I will try a different approach. I will move up to (2,2), even though it's a wall, is not possible. So my next best move would be to (3,1) or to (2,1) to move around the '1' (wall). I choose (2,1) for my next step because it is more direct.

My next move is (2,1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a 'Cross shape' with an extension or branch at the bottom.

Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5), with empty spaces that form a similar Cross shape with an extension:
 
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 G
1 P 0 0 1
