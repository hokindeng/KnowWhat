You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position
The current player position is represented by 'P' in the maze. Looking at the maze provided, the player position 'P' is located at the bottom right part of the maze. To identify the exact coordinates, we count the rows and columns starting from 0 at the top left corner. The 'P' is in the 4th row and the 4th column, so its coordinates are (4,4).

## Step 2: Identify the goal position
The goal position is represented by 'G' in the maze. Looking at the maze provided, the goal 'G' is located at the 2nd row and the 3rd column. So, its coordinates are (2,3).

## Step 3: Examine possible moves from the current position
Given the player's position at (4,4), we look for adjacent empty spaces (represented by '0') to determine where we can move. We can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally. Checking the maze:
- Moving up (4,3) is a wall '1', which is not a valid move.
- Moving down is not possible as we are at the bottom edge of the maze.
- Moving left (4,3) is an empty space '0', which is a valid move.
- Moving right is not possible as we are at the right edge of the maze.
- Moving diagonally up-right is not possible as we are at the right edge of the maze and there's a wall.
- Moving diagonally down-left, down-right, and up-left are not valid moves due to being at the edges or the presence of walls.

## Step 4: Choose the best move
Based on the analysis, the only valid move is moving left to the position (4,3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position
The current player position is represented by 'P' in the maze. After the last move, the 'P' is now in the 4th row and the 3rd column, but since the maze representation has changed to reflect 'P' in a different column due to the addition of a '0' to the right, we need to adjust our counting. 'P' is actually in the 4th row and the 2nd column because we moved left and the rightmost '0' is new, indicating a shift in column counting. So, its corrected coordinates after the accurate assessment of the updated maze are (4,2).

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal position remains the same as before the move. It is still represented by 'G' in the maze, located at the 2nd row and the 3rd column. So, its coordinates remain (2,3).

## Step 3: Examine possible moves from the current position
Given the player's new position at (4,2), we look for adjacent empty spaces (represented by '0') to determine where we can move. Checking the maze:
- Moving up (3,2) and (2,2) would require checking two spaces up, which shows a wall '1' directly above the player, making a direct upward move not possible, but there is a '0' two spaces above the player that can be reached by diagonal movement.
- Moving down is not possible as we are at the bottom edge of the maze.
- Moving left (4,1) is an empty space '0', which is a valid move.
- Moving right (4,3) is also an empty space '0', which is a valid move.
- Diagonal moves need to be considered, especially moving up-left and up-right to navigate through.
- Moving diagonally up-left (3,1) and then intending to move further diagonally can be considered, but immediate diagonal moves into adjacent spaces show that only moving directly left or right provides immediate empty '0' spaces without hitting walls or going out of bounds.

## Step 4: Choose the best move based on the goal's location
Considering the goal's location at (2,3) and our current position at (4,2), moving up directly is obstructed but moving diagonally up is feasible through empty spaces. However, based on the immediate options, moving right seems promising because it brings us closer to aligning vertically with the goal 'G' at (2,3) without immediately encountering a wall or out-of-bounds issue, allowing for potential up or up-right diagonal movement in the next step.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
After examining the original maze and considering the movement required to navigate from 'P' to 'G', it can be observed that the empty spaces form a path that resembles an 'L' shape, combining horizontal and vertical corridors to connect 'P' and 'G'. This L-shape is a bit irregular due to the presence of diagonal movements and additional empty spaces, but overall, the dominant structure resembles an 'L'.

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same size and a similar L-shaped path
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to maintain the 5x5 size and ensure there is a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces that form an L-shape. Here is a new maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces clearly form an L-shaped path that allows the player 'P' to move to the goal 'G'. The maze is not an identical copy of the original and maintains the required size and shape characteristics.

The final answer is: There is no number to solve this problem, as the task is to provide a description and a new maze, both of which have been included in the steps above.
