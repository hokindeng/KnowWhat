You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I'm starting at the position marked 'P' at the bottom of the maze, my initial position is (4, 4).

After analyzing the maze, I'd like to move up to the empty space directly above my current position.

My next move will be to the coordinates (4, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and provide the updated maze for my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I'm now at the position (4, 3) marked 'P', I'd like to move left to the empty space.

My next move will be to the coordinates (3, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and provide the updated maze for my next move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A Staircase or a Zigzag shape.

The empty spaces in the original maze resemble a staircase or a zigzag pattern, allowing the player to move through the maze in a zigzag path from the starting position (P) to the goal position (G).

Here's a new maze with the same size and shape, but with a different layout:

(2) New Maze:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 G
1 0 0 1 1
1 P 1 0 0

This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is also a staircase or zigzag shape, although the specific layout is different from the original maze.
