You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at coordinates (0,3) and the goal is at (1,0).

To get closer to the goal while avoiding walls, my next move would be to go up and left. However, since I can move diagonally, my next move will be diagonally up and left to coordinates (1,2).

Please update the maze to reflect this move, and I'll plan the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I've moved successfully to (1,2).

Now, to get even closer to the goal, I'll move diagonally up and left again to coordinates (1,1), adjacent to the goal.

Please update the maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I'm now very close to the goal, which is at coordinates (1,0).

Since I'm right next to the goal, my next move will be to move left to coordinates (1,0), which is the goal position itself.

That should complete the maze solution!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I can see that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is roughly an "L-shape" or an "L-corridor".

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:


1 1 0 1 1
1 G 0 0 P
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

This new maze has the same 5x5 size, includes a valid path from P to G, and has empty spaces that form a recognizable L-shape. Note that this is not an identical copy of the original maze, but rather a new instance with the same shape.
