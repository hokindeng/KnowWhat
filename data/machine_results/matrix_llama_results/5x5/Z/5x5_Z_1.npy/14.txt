You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at coordinates (2,3), and the goal position is at coordinates (1,0). 

My next move will be to the position (2,2), since it's an empty space adjacent to the current player position. 

Coordinates of my next move: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I've moved successfully to (2,2). 

My next move will be to the position (1,2), since it's an empty space adjacent to the current player position and it brings me closer to the goal. 

Coordinates of my next move: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved successfully to (1,2). Now, I'll try to get even closer to the goal.

My next move will be to the position (1,1), since it's an empty space adjacent to the current player position and it brings me even closer to the goal.

Coordinates of my next move: (1,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved successfully to (1,1). Now, I'll try to reach the goal position.

My next move will be to the position (1,0), which is the goal position.

Coordinates of my next move: (1,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A "U" shape or a Curved Path

The empty spaces in the original maze form a curved path that connects the starting point P to the goal position G.

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "U" shape or curved path:

1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1

Note that this new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and features a curved path or "U" shape formed by its empty spaces.
