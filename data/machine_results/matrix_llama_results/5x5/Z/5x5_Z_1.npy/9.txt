You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position right of the current position 'P'. This is because the goal 'G' is on the same row as 'P' but to the left. Since we can move diagonally, moving directly towards the goal might collide with the wall. Moving to the right first will allow us to approach the goal without hitting the wall.

The coordinates of the current position 'P' are (1,3). Thus, I will move to (1,4), but since the maze is 0-indexed and there is a wall at (1,4), I will actually move to the position that allows a future diagonal move towards 'G'. However, since a direct diagonal is blocked by a wall, the strategy involves moving around to approach 'G'. The immediate next move to initiate this strategy, considering the maze layout, would be to move down to (2,3), but again, considering the options and the wall placement, the most strategic next move is actually to move to an empty space that is closer to 'G' but isn't blocked by a wall.

Therefore, I choose to move diagonally up and left, aiming to get closer to 'G'. The new position would be (1,2) or one position left of 'P' since moving diagonally up-left isn't immediately possible due to the wall's configuration and the rules of movement. Thus, the strategic approach, taking into consideration the mistake in direct diagonal movement towards 'G', leads to considering each step carefully to navigate around the walls correctly.

My move is to (1,2), which in the context of this maze, represents moving left from the current position 'P', aiming to eventually go around the obstacles to reach 'G'.

Corrected Move: To (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved to (1,2), my next goal is to get closer to 'G'. Given the current state of the maze, I can see that 'G' is directly to my left. 

To approach 'G' directly without hitting any walls, I will move diagonally up and left. However, since diagonal movement is allowed but direct access to 'G' is possible by simply moving left, I choose the most direct path available considering the maze structure and avoid overcomplicating the path.

My next move will be directly to the left, to the position of 'G'. However, the goal is not to jump over 'G' but to navigate to it, and given the rules of movement and the fact that we're considering step-by-step logical progression towards 'G' without skipping over it, the approach involves reaching the position right before 'G' if we were to approach it laterally.

Given the opportunity to correct the approach and recognizing the direct path is preferable when available, I'll adjust the strategy to approach 'G' directly from the current position, which allows the simplest and most direct path forward.

Move directly to the left towards 'G'.

Corrected Move: To (1,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've reached the position right next to 'G'. Since the goal is to navigate to 'G', the next and final move is directly to the position of 'G'. This move will place me directly on the goal 'G', completing the maze.

Move directly to the left onto 'G'.

Move: To (1,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a modified "zig-zag" or more closely resembling an "L-shape with extensions".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "L-shape with extensions":

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 G
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1

This new maze meets the criteria, having the same size as the original, including a valid path from P to G, not being an identical copy, and forming an "L-shape with extensions" with its empty spaces.
