You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves. To start, I will identify the coordinates of the current player position (P) and the goal position (G), and then determine the best initial move.

The player position (P) is at coordinates (0, 3), assuming the top-left corner is (0,0) and the x-axis moves horizontally to the right, and the y-axis moves vertically downwards.

The goal position (G) is at coordinates (1, 0).

Given the player's current position (0, 3) and the goal (1, 0), and the maze layout, a reasonable first move would be to move left to the adjacent empty space. This will put me closer to the goal and provide more options for subsequent moves.

Therefore, my next move would be to the coordinates (0, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as roughly resembling an "inverted L" or a "bootstrap" shape, but considering it in a broader, more abstract sense, it could be seen as resembling a zigzag-like or "Z" shape if the open areas are interpreted as being part of a larger, continuous path that includes diagonals.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size that also contains empty spaces forming a zigzag or "Z"-like shape when considering the whole path, including diagonal movements:


1 1 0 1 1
G 0 1 0 P
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
0 0 1 0 1

This maze maintains the same criteria as the original: same size, non-identical layout, valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and the path resembles a zigzag or "Z"-like shape considering diagonal movements as part of the continuous path.
