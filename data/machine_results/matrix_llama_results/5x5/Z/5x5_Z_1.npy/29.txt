You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). My first move will be to an empty space adjacent to my current position.

My next move will be to the position right above my current position. The updated coordinates will be:

 Current Position (P): (1,3)
 New Position: (1,2)

The coordinates of my next move are (1,2).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at the new position (1,2), I'll plan my next move.

My next move will be to the left, to the position adjacent to the goal (G). The coordinates of my next move are (1,1).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting close to the goal!

My next move will be to the position of the goal itself. I'll move one step to the left, to the coordinates (1,0).

Please update the maze accordingly. I hope I've reached the goal!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A roughly inverted "L" shape with an additional diagonal branch.

Now, here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 1

This new maze has a valid path from P to G, and the empty spaces form a similar inverted "L" shape with a diagonal branch. Note that the exact layout is different from the original maze, but the overall shape of the corridors is recognizable as an inverted "L" with a diagonal branch.
