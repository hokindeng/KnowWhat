You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves step by step to reach the goal 'G' from the player position 'P'.

The initial maze is:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

The player 'P' is at position (1, 3).

Since my goal is to reach 'G', which is at (1, 0), my strategy will be to try to move closer to it in each step while avoiding walls.

For my first move, I can move the player 'P' to (1, 2), as it is an empty space adjacent to 'P'. This is a move to the left.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved to (1, 2), I will plan my next move.

Looking at the maze:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

My goal 'G' is still at (1, 0), and I'm at (1, 2). The closest empty space that brings me nearer to 'G' is at (1, 1).

So, my next move will be to (1, 1).

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (1, 1), which is closer to 'G'.

Now, the maze is:

1 1 1 1 1
G P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

My goal 'G' is at (1, 0), and I'm at (1, 1). I'm almost there! The next move is obvious: I will move to (1, 0) to reach the goal 'G'.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

I can identify that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is an "L" shape, which is a type of bent or angular shape with two segments.

To create a new maze of the same size, I'll design a new "L"-shaped corridor in a different configuration. Here is the new maze:

1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1

In this new maze, the "L"-shaped corridor still connects the player position 'P' to the goal 'G' through a valid path, but the maze is not identical to the original. The new "L" shape is rotated and has its segments rearranged, creating a distinct maze that meets the required criteria.
