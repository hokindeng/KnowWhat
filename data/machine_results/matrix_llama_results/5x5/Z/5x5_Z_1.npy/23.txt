You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (2,3). The goal is at position G (1,0). My surroundings are empty spaces to the left and top-left, and a wall to the right and bottom.

I will move diagonally up-left to position (1,2), which is an empty space.

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (1,2). The goal is at position G (1,0). My surroundings are an empty space to the left and a wall to the top, right, and bottom.

I will move left to position (1,1), which is an empty space and one step closer to the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (1,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at position P (1,1). The goal is at position G (1,0), which is just one step to the left.

I will move left to position (1,0), which is the goal position.

My next move coordinates are: (1,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A " diagonal tunnel" or a "diagonal corridor" with an extension to the side.

To create a new maze with the same size and a similar diagonal tunnel shape, I present:

(2) A new maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 1 1 1

This new maze has a similar diagonal tunnel shape with an extension to the side, while not being an identical copy of the original maze. The path from P to G can be reached through empty spaces. Note that I've flipped the position of P and G to add some variation.
