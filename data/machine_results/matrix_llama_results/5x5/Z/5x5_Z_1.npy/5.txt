You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. I am currently at position P (2, 3), and my goal is to reach G (1, 0). 

My next move will be to (2, 2), which is an empty space to the left and adjacent to my current position. The coordinates of my next move are:

(2, 2)

Please update the maze with my new position and let me know the new state of the maze for my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my current position at (2, 2) and my goal at (1, 0), my next move will be to get closer to the goal while avoiding the walls. 

I will move up to (1, 2), which is an empty space. The coordinates of my next move are:

(1, 2)

Please update the maze with my new position and let me know the new state of the maze for my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting closer to the goal. With my current position at (1, 2) and my goal at (1, 0), I will move left to get closer to the goal.

I will move to (1, 1), which is an empty space. The coordinates of my next move are:

(1, 1)

Please update the maze with my new position and let me know the new state of the maze for my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm almost there. With my current position at (1, 1) and my goal at (1, 0), I can now move directly to the goal position.

I will move left to (1, 0), which is the goal position. The coordinates of my next move are:

(1, 0)

Please let me know if I've successfully solved the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A "C" or a curved channel

The empty spaces in the original maze form a curved path that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal position.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 G 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a curved channel that allows the player to move from the starting position (P) to the goal position (G). The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it retains the same general shape and structure.
