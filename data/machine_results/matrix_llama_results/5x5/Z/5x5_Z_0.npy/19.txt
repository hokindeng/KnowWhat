You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at coordinates (0,3). 

We can see that moving up is not an option, as there is no empty space above the current position. We can also discard moving left or right, as the goal position (G) is situated below the current position.

Given that we can move diagonally, we will prioritize moving down and to the left. This seems like the most efficient path to reach the goal (G), avoiding obstacles. However, since we can only move to adjacent spaces, our first move should be directly down.

The coordinates of the next move are (1,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, we can see that our previous move to (1,3) was correct. Our next priority is to move left and get closer to the goal. 

However, we cannot move directly left, as there is a wall (1) at (1,2). Given our ability to move diagonally, we can move down and left. The space at (2,2) is empty (0), which makes it a suitable next position.

The coordinates of the next move are (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We've made progress. Our next priority is to continue moving downwards towards the goal (G). However, the direct downward path is blocked by a wall (1) at (3,2). We also cannot move directly to the left or right, as those paths are blocked by walls.

One option is to move down and left diagonally to (3,1). However, this would put us in a difficult position, as our next move would be limited by the surrounding walls.

The other option is to move down and right diagonally, but that would take us further away from the goal (G).

Given the limited options, we will move down and left diagonally to (3,1). 

The coordinates of the next move are (3,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at (3,1), our priority is to move towards the goal (G) which is below us. We cannot move directly down, as there is a wall (1) that we would collide into after the move. However, we can move diagonally down and right to (4,2) where the goal (G) is not directly blocked by a wall.

The coordinates of the next move are (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at (4,2), our priority is to move towards the goal (G) which is now directly to our left. There are no obstacles between our current position and the goal (G), so the optimal move is to move left.

The coordinates of the next move are (4,1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(distorted) inverted U-shape".

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:


0 1 1 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 0 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an inverted U-shape, which is similar to the original maze but not an identical copy. The player (P) can navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal (G).
