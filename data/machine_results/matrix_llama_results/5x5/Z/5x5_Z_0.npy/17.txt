You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. I am currently at position P, which is (0,3). My goal is to reach G, which is (4,1). I will move down one step to (1,3) since it's an empty space next to my current position. This new position will allow me to move closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

My next move coordinates are (1,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move. I am currently at position P, which is (1,3). To reach G, I need to continue moving down. However, since I can also move diagonally, I will move diagonally down and to the left, to position (2,2). This new position will bring me closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

My next move coordinates are (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move. I am currently at position P, which is (2,2). My goal is to reach G, which is (4,1) or more specifically four steps down and one step left from my initial "P" position or, in this case, one step down and one step left. To continue moving towards the goal, I will move down and to the left, to position (3,1). 

My next move coordinates are (3,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move. I am currently at position P, which is (3,1). Since I'm right above the goal (G), which is (4,1), and there's an empty space at that position, I can move directly down to reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are (4,1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a zigzag or a stepped path.

Here's a new maze that meets the specified criteria:

0 1 0 0 P
1 0 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 G 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces also form a zigzag or stepped path, allowing the player to navigate from the starting position P to the goal G.
