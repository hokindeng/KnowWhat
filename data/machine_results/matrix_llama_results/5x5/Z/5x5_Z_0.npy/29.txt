You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 3) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (4, 1).

My next move would be to the position (0, 4), which is directly to the right of the current position 'P'.

Please update the maze accordingly.

Move: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0, 4).

My next move would be to the position (1, 4), which is directly below my current position. However, this position is a wall. I'll try again.

My next move would be to the position (1, 3), which is diagonally down-left from my current position. This position is empty.

Move: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (1, 3).

My next move would be to the position (2, 2), which is diagonally down-left from my current position. This position is empty.

Move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2, 2).

My next move would be to the position (3, 2), which is directly below my current position, but there's a wall at (3, 2). Let me try again.

My next move would be to the position (3, 1), but this position is also not suitable.

My next move would be to the position (2, 1), which is to the left of my current position. However, this position is also not empty.

My next move would be to the position (3, 0), no, that's not correct either.

My next move would be to the position (3, 3) is not empty and also on the same column of a potential solution on the right most part of a proposed later move if such is to take place; no - however. 

Move: (2, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a "corner shape".


Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:


0 G 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 P 1 1 0

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
