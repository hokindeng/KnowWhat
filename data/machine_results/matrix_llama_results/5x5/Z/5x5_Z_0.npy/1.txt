You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. I am currently at position P, which is (0,3). My goal is to reach position G, which is (4,1). 

Since I can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, I will analyze the surrounding empty spaces. 

The empty spaces adjacent to my current position P (0,3) are (0,2) and (0,4). 

However, moving to (0,2) or (0,4) would not bring me closer to the goal G (4,1). I need to move down to reduce the vertical distance to the goal. 

The closest empty space that is down from my current position is at (1,3), but it's blocked by a wall. I will have to move to the right first and then move down. 

Therefore, I will move to position (0,4).

My next move coordinates are (0,4). 

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I'll be happy to plan my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I am now at position P (0,4). I still want to move down to reduce the vertical distance to the goal G (4,1). 

Since I can move diagonally to an adjacent empty space, I will analyze the options below me. There is an empty space diagonally down-left from my current position, at coordinates (1,3). 

However, moving to (1,3) would put me closer to the goal in the vertical direction, but I would be blocked by a wall and couldn't move down further.

I notice that moving diagonally down-right isn't an option either because there's a wall at (1,5).

However, I can try to find another path. I can see an empty space at position (2,3), but it's two steps down and to the left. 

To move down, I should move one step down to the empty space on the right, and then work my way left.

However, moving down and right isn't an option as well, since there is a wall.

After re-checking the possibilities, I will move down one step and left one step to (1,3).

My next move coordinates are (1,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I am now at position P (1,3). I still want to move down to reduce the vertical distance to the goal G (4,1). 

Since I am blocked by walls directly below me, I will try to move to an adjacent empty space on the left or right.

However, moving to the right isn't an option because there's a wall at (1,4).

Moving to the left, I see an empty space diagonally up-left, but that would move me away from the goal. However, I see a possibility to move diagonally down-left to (2,2).

My next move coordinates are (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I am now at position P (2,2). I still want to move down to reduce the vertical distance to the goal G (4,1). 

Since I can move diagonally to an adjacent empty space, I will analyze the options below me. Moving directly down isn't an option because there's a wall at (3,2).

However, I see an empty space diagonally down-left at (3,1).

My next move coordinates are (3,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I am now at position P (3,1). I am just one step away from the goal G (4,1). 

Since the goal is directly below me and there are no obstacles, I will move down to the goal.

My next move coordinates are (4,1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "S-shape" or a "sigmoid curve", but more generally, a curved or bent shape could be described as an "arc" or an "L-shape". However, the most suitable and common shape name for this maze would be an "S-shape" or a curved path that could also resemble a "hook" or an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form a similar shape:

0 P 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0
0 1 G 1 0

In this new maze, the path from P to G forms a similar curved shape (S-shape or L-shape) and can be reached through empty spaces. The maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but the shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a similar bent or curved path.
