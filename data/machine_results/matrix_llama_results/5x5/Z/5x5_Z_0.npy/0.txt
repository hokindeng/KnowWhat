You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 3) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (4, 1).

My next move will be to the empty space down from the current position, which has coordinates (1, 3). However, I noticed that there is a wall below, and moving diagonally to (1, 2) or (1, 4) would also hit a wall.

Since the goal is to move towards the goal position 'G', my next move will be to the right of the current position, which is not possible because there is no space. So, I'll move to the empty space to the left of the current position, which has coordinates (0, 2).

My move will be to coordinates (0, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect this move and provide the updated maze for the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (0, 2). My next step is to move down towards the goal position. However, I see that moving directly down to (1, 2) would hit a wall.

Since I want to move down and towards the goal, I can try moving diagonally down-left to (1, 1), but that would also hit a wall. Moving diagonally down-right to (1, 3) is a possibility, as there is an empty space.

My move will be to coordinates (1, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect this move and provide the updated maze for the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (1, 3). Since my ultimate goal is to reach the goal position 'G' at (4, 1), I need to move towards it.

I can move diagonally down-right, but that would put me at a wall. Moving directly down would put me at a wall as well. However, I can move diagonally down-left to (2, 2), which is an empty space.

My move will be to coordinates (2, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect this move and provide the updated maze for the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (2, 2). I need to continue moving towards the goal position 'G'.

I'm currently surrounded by walls, so I need to find a way to escape this position. Moving up or to the right would put me back at a previous position. Moving down is not possible due to the wall. However, I can move left to (2, 1), which is not a wall, but rather a part of the path towards the goal position 'G'.

My move will be to coordinates (2, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect this move and provide the updated maze for the next step.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a "corner shape". The empty spaces form a clear L-shape from the top-left to the bottom-right, allowing the player to navigate through the maze.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:
```
0 0 0 0 P
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 0
```
Note that this new maze meets the criteria:

* Same size as the original maze
* Includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
* Not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by the empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape or corner shape.

Please let me know if this meets your requirements!
