You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves. The current player position (P) is at coordinates (0,3).

My possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible, as I am already at the top row.
- Down: Possible, but there is a wall.
- Left: Possible, and the space is empty.
- Right: Possible, and the space is empty.
- Diagonals: Only the top-left diagonal is possible and empty, but since we are already at the top row, it is effectively the same as moving left.

I will choose to move right, as it will allow me to explore the maze further and potentially find a path to the goal. The coordinates of my next move are (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I have moved to the position (0,4).

Analyzing the current state of the maze, I will consider possible moves:
- Up: Not possible, as I am already at the top row.
- Down: Not possible, as there is a wall.
- Left: Possible, as the space is empty.
- Right: Not possible, as I am already at the rightmost column.
- Diagonals: Only the bottom-left diagonal is possible, but it will move me closer to the wall.

I will choose to move down-left, but since that's a diagonal and I will be blocked by the wall if I move down, I will move left instead. I will move to the position (0,3), which I previously occupied. 

However, I noticed a better alternative after further examination. The correct move is actually moving left twice or exploring alternative paths to get closer to the goal, but since we can move diagonally, a good option is available. I can move diagonally down-left, to the position (1 doesn't work due to a wall), so my next choice for a possible move is diagonally down-left, one more row down (if wall not in the way at chosen space coordinate): However, there is a wall located at the down Candidate positions do contain a position where we won't be blocked, actually going even further left we'll stay on the top row: (0,3), one column left from current and go further so the updated intermediate destination for 'P' is (0,2).

My next move is to position (0,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or "L-path". This is because the empty spaces in the original maze, when connected, resemble the shape of the letter "L".


To generate a new maze of the same size with the same L-shape path, I will create a new maze. Here it is:


0 0 0 1 0
1 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 0
0 0 1 G 0


This new maze has the same size as the original maze (5x5), includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces in this new maze still form a recognizable L-shape.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
