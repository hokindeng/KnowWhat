You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at coordinates (0,3). Since the goal position is at coordinates (4,1), we need to move towards it while avoiding walls.

Our next move should aim to move closer to the goal while keeping in mind the wall layout and the available empty spaces.

Looking at the maze, the most straightforward initial move would be to move right from the current position to the adjacent empty space. This would place us at coordinates (0,4).

Therefore, the coordinates of our next move would be (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We are now at coordinates (0,4). Looking at the maze, we can see that our next possible moves involve going down. To progress towards the goal, we can move down to the adjacent empty space at coordinates (1,4). However, this space is not available since it contains a wall.

Instead, we will move down and left diagonally to coordinates (1 is not possible, so let's go to) (2 is not possible, so) (1 is a wall) ...  (1,3) to put us at a position with the greatest number of options on our next turn.

Since that is not possible our best move is to go down two and left two, that would put us at: (2,2).

Our next move will be (2,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path", but most closely resembling an L-shape rotated to the right (roughly).

Here is a new maze with the same size as the original, but with a different layout, where the empty spaces form a similar L-shape:


1 0 0 0 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 0
1 1 0 1 1
0 0 G 0 1

In this new maze, the path from P to G still follows an L-shape. Note that the maze is not an identical copy of the original, and the wall layout has been modified while maintaining a valid path from P to G.
