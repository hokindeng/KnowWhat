You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (0,3).

Here's the analysis of adjacent spaces:
- Up: (not possible, as P is at the top row)
- Down: (1,3) is a wall (1)
- Left: (0,2) is an empty space (0)
- Right: (0,4) is an empty space (0)
- Diagonal Up-Left: (not possible, as P is at the top row)
- Diagonal Up-Right: (not possible, as P is at the top row)
- Diagonal Down-Left: (1,2) is a wall (1)
- Diagonal Down-Right: (1,4) is a wall (1)

Considering the available options, I will move to the empty space at (0,4).

The coordinates of my next move are: (0,4)

Please update the maze with my new position and present it again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (P) at coordinates (0,4).

Here's the analysis of adjacent spaces:
- Up: (not possible, as P is at the top row)
- Down: (1,4) is a wall (1)
- Left: (0,3) is an empty space (0)
- Right: (not possible, as P is at the rightmost column)
- Diagonal Up-Left: (not possible, as P is at the top row)
- Diagonal Up-Right: (not possible, as P is at the top row and rightmost column)
- Diagonal Down-Left: (1,3) is an empty space (0)
- Diagonal Down-Right: (not possible, as P is at the rightmost column)

Considering the available options, I will move to the empty space at (0,3).

The coordinates of my next move are: (0,3)

The coordinates of my next move are: (0,1)

However, I realize that I've already visited this space and the spaces adjacent to it. It's time to explore other options.

Upon reviewing the maze, I notice that there might be a path to the goal (G) through the center or the right side of the maze. I'll need to revisit some spaces to explore these possibilities.

Let me correct my move. I will move to the empty space at (0,4) to start exploring the right side of the maze.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0,4)

Please update the maze with my new position and present it again.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "**U-shaped**" or "**Horseshoe-shaped**" path, where the empty spaces form a curved or bent passage from the starting point (P) to the goal (G).

Now, here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

0 P 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 0
0 G 1 1 0

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a U-shaped or Horseshoe-shaped path from P to G. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a U-shaped or Horseshoe-shaped path.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
