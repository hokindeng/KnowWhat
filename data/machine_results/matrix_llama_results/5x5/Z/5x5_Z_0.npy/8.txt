You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. I am currently at position P, which is (0,3). My goal is to reach G, which is (4,1). My next move should avoid walls and aim towards the goal.

I can see that the positions up, left, and right of my current position are empty. To make progress towards the goal, I will choose to move right, which puts me at coordinates (0,4).

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I'm now at position (0,4). Since I need to head towards the goal, which is at (4,1), I should try to move downwards.

I observe that the position directly below me is a wall, so I need to find an alternative. Looking at the maze, I see that the position down and to the left of my current position is also a wall, but the position down and to the right of that, at (1,3), is an empty space (0) that I can move to diagonally.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (1,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I'm now at position (1,3). To continue heading towards the goal, I want to move downwards.

Looking at the maze, I see that the position directly below me is a wall, but the position down and to the left of that, at (2,2), is an empty space (0) that I can move to diagonally.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I'm now at position (2,2). My goal is still at (4,1).

I observe that the position below me is a wall, so I need to look for an alternative. I see that the position to the left of me is also a wall, but the position to the right of me, at (2,3), is not a viable option since it's a wall as well.

However, I can try moving diagonally down and to the left, to the empty space at (3,1). This will bring me closer to the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I'm now at position (3,1). I'm right above a wall, and I have a clear path to the left to the goal.

Since my goal is to the left and down, I can simply move down to reach it. Moving down will put me at position (4,1), which is the goal position.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (4,1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "S" shape or a reversed "S" shape.

This shape is recognizable due to the curved path that connects the start and end points, with two distinct turns that resemble the bends in an "S" shape.

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "S" shape:


0 P 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0


This new maze meets all the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and features an "S"-shaped path formed by its empty spaces.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
