You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves. 

The current player position is 'P', which is at coordinates (0, 3). 

The goal position 'G' is at coordinates (4, 1).

My next move will be to move the player down. 

The new coordinates of the player will be (1, 3) but since there is a wall at (1, 3) I will move diagonally to (1, 4), however, there is also a wall at that position. Therefore, I will move the player down and to the left to coordinates (1, 2), nope, there is a wall there too.

Let's try moving right then.

The new coordinates of the player will be (0, 4) no wall there. 

My next move is: (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the possible moves. 

The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 4).

The goal position 'G' is at coordinates (4, 1).

Since the goal is down, I will try to move down. 

The new coordinates of the player will be (1, 4), however, there is a wall at that position. 

Let's try moving down and to the left then.

The new coordinates of the player will be (1, 3), yes, that is an open space.

My next move is: (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the possible moves. 

The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (1, 3).

The goal position 'G' is at coordinates (4, 1).

Since the goal is down, I will try to move down. 

The new coordinates of the player will be (2, 3), however, there is a wall at that position.

Let's try moving down and to the left then.

The new coordinates of the player will be (2, 2), yes, that is an open space.

My next move is: (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the possible moves. 

The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (2, 2).

The goal position 'G' is at coordinates (4, 1).

Since the goal is down, I will try to move down. 

The new coordinates of the player will be (3, 2), however, there is a wall at that position.

Let's try moving down and to the left then.

The new coordinates of the player will be (3, 1), yes, that is an open space.

My next move is: (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the possible moves. 

The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (3, 1).

The goal position 'G' is at coordinates (4, 1).

Since the goal is just one step down, I will try to move down.

The new coordinates of the player will be (4, 1), which is the goal position.

My next move is: (4, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "S" shape or a serpentine shape.

Here's a new maze with the same size and shape:

0 0 P 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 G 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces (corridors) form a serpentine or "S" shape, similar to the original maze. The maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original.
