You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position (P) is at coordinates (0, 2).

My first move will be to move right to the adjacent empty space at coordinates (0, 3).

Please confirm and provide the updated maze.

Next move coordinates: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I have moved successfully to (0, 3). Now, I want to move down to the adjacent empty space at coordinates (1, 3). However, I see a wall at (1, 3), so that's not possible. Instead, I will move down to the adjacent empty space at coordinates (1 is not possible, so I will try 2, no, or maybe) (3 is good) (no G)... coordinates (3, 3).

Please confirm (there aren't many more places) and provide the updated maze.

Next move coordinates: (3, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would say that the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a "zig-zag" or a "staircase" shape.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

0 0 0 P 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 G 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is still a "zig-zag" or "staircase" shape, but it's not an identical copy of the original maze.
