You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P). My new coordinates will be (0, 3).

I chose this move because the space to the right is empty (0), and it is a valid move according to the game rules.

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move down to the empty space below my current position. My new coordinates will be (1, 3).

I chose this move because the space below is empty (0 in the second row doesn't align with my current position but 1st column has a 1. my column, the 4th has 1 so I am going to the empty space (0) that is located in the 2nd row which the columns match my current position), and it is a valid move according to the game rules.

However I realize now my move will put me into the 2nd row and 3rd column. Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

My new coordinates will be (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move down to the empty space below my current position, specifically to the goal position (G). My new coordinates will be (2, 2).

I chose this move because the space below is the goal position (G), and it is a valid move according to the game rules.

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a zigzag or a somewhat diagonal path.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

0 1 P 0 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1

This new maze has the same size as the original maze (5x5), includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and features a zigzag or somewhat diagonal path formed by its empty spaces.
