You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position (P) is at coordinates (0, 2).

My first move will be down to coordinates (1, 2) since it's an empty space adjacent to my current position.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

(new position: 1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (1, 2), I will move down to coordinates (2, 2). However, I notice that position (2, 2) has a wall (1), but position (2, 1) has the goal (G). Unfortunately, I'm blocked by a wall and can't reach the goal directly.

My next move will be to coordinates (1, 1) since it's the closest empty space that might allow me to get around the wall and eventually reach the goal.

(new position: 1, 1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) an "L-shape" or an "elbow shape", where the empty spaces form a 90-degree turn, connecting the top row to the left or right column.

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

0 1 1 0 1
0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form an L-shape, and there is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces.
