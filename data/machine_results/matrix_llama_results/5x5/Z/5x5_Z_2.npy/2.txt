You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves. The current player position (P) is at coordinates (0,2).

My possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible, as I'm already at the top row.
- Down: Possible, as the space below me is empty (0).
- Left: Possible, as the space to my left is empty (0).
- Right: Not possible, as the space to my right is a wall (1).
- Diagonal (up-left): Not possible, as I'm already at the top row.
- Diagonal (up-right): Not possible, as I'm already at the top row and the space to my right is a wall (1).
- Diagonal (down-left): Possible, as the space below and to my left is empty (0).
- Diagonal (down-right): Not possible, as the space below and to my right is a wall (1).

Considering these possibilities, I will choose to move down to the space below me, as it brings me closer to the goal (G).

The coordinates of my next move are: (1,2)

Please update the maze accordingly, and I will analyze the next possible moves.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the possible moves from my current position (P) at coordinates (1,2).

My possible moves are:
- Up: Possible, as the space above me is empty (0).
- Down: Not possible, as the space below me is a wall (1).
- Left: Not possible, as the space to my left is a wall (1).
- Right: Not possible, as the space to my right is a wall (1).
- Diagonal (up-left): Not possible, as the space above and to my left is a wall (1).
- Diagonal (up-right): Not possible, as the space above and to my right is a wall (1).
- Diagonal (down-left): Not possible, as the space below and to my left is a wall (1).
- Diagonal (down-right): Not possible, as the space below and to my right is a wall (1).

Considering these possibilities, I will choose to move up to the space above me.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0,2)

Please update the maze accordingly, and I will analyze the next possible moves.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems I've returned to the starting position!

My possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible, as I'm already at the top row.
- Down: Possible, as the space below me is empty (0), but I've already tried that path.
- Left: Possible, as the space to my left is empty (0).
- Right: Not possible, as the space to my right is a wall (1).
- Diagonal (up-left): Not possible, as I'm already at the top row.
- Diagonal (up-right): Not possible, as I'm already at the top row and the space to my right is a wall (1).
- Diagonal (down-left): Possible, as the space below and to my left is empty (0), but I'll consider a simpler move first.
- Diagonal (down-right): Not possible, as the space below and to my right is a wall (1).

Considering these possibilities, I will choose to move left to the space next to me.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0,1)

Please update the maze accordingly, and I will analyze the next possible moves.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (P) at coordinates (0,1), I will analyze the possible moves.

My possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible, as I'm already at the top row.
- Down: Possible, as the space below me is a wall (1), but actually the space below and one column to the right is empty (0) however two spaces below me is empty (0) two columns to the left.
- Left: Possible, as the space to my left is empty (0).
- Right: Possible, as the space to my right is empty (0).
- Diagonal (up-left): Not possible, as I'm already at the top row.
- Diagonal (up-right): Not possible, as I'm already at the top row.
- Diagonal (down-left): Not possible, as the space below and to my left is a wall (1).
- Diagonal (down-right): Not possible, as the space below and to my right is a wall (1).

Considering these possibilities, I will choose to move left to the space next to me.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0,0)

Please update the maze accordingly, and I will analyze the next possible moves.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (P) at coordinates (0,0), I will analyze the possible moves.

My possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible, as I'm already at the top row.
- Down: Possible, as the space below me is a wall (1), but this would put me in an unwanted spot.
- Left: Not possible, as I'm already at the leftmost column.
- Right: Possible, as the space to my right is empty (0).
- Diagonal (up-left): Not possible, as I'm already at the top row and leftmost column.
- Diagonal (up-right): Not possible, as I'm already at the top row.
- Diagonal (down-left): Not possible, as the space below and to my left is already on the leftmost column.
- Diagonal (down-right): Not possible, as the space below and to my right is a wall (1).

Considering these possibilities, I will choose to move right to the space next to me.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0,1)

However since I already moved to this spot, from the prior position and this spot also basically yielded that going to spot 0 0 put me in the same dilemma.

Instead of going immediately back in this loop which was formed before which will put me forever stuck to going back to one previous spot.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back to this position again.

To avoid getting stuck in a loop, I will re-analyze the maze and consider a different move. Since I've already tried moving left and right, I'll think about moving down.

However, moving directly down is not possible due to the wall. But I notice that the space two rows below me is empty (0), and the space one row below and two columns to the right is also empty (0). This might be a way to escape the loop.

I'll plan a move that could potentially lead me to a new path. Since I need to move down, but the space directly below me is a wall, I'll aim for the space two rows below me, which is empty.

To get there, I'll move down to the space with coordinates (1,1), which is currently a wall (1) adjacent to me, is actually not accessible however the next space (1,2) two columns to my right is. 

Then from that position i will move down again to try get below past the (1,1).

However due the complexity i must first get to position 0 2

The coordinates of my next move are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back to this position again.

As I planned earlier, I'll move down to the space with coordinates (1,2), but since I'm currently at (0,2), I'll first move down to get to the row below.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1,2), I'll analyze the possible moves again.

I notice that the goal (G) is just below me, but there's a wall (1) separating us. However, I also see that the space to the left of the goal is accessible.

I'll plan a move that could potentially lead me to the goal. Since I need to get around the wall, I'll aim for the space below and to the left of the goal.

To get there, I'll move down to the space with coordinates (2,1), which is currently next to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (2,1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(distorted) Half-Circle" or " Half-Moon" shape. However a more fitting answer will be "Reverse H".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "Reverse H" shape:


0 1 0 0 0
1 0 P 1 1
1 0 1 0 G
0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar "Reverse H" shape, and there is a valid path from P to G that can be reached through the empty spaces. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it shares the same general shape and structure.
