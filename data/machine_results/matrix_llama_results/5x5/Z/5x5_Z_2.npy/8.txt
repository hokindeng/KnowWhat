You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position (0, 2), marked as 'P'. My goal is to reach position (2, 1), marked as 'G'. To do this, I will move down and to the right. However, since I can only move to empty spaces, I will move diagonally down and to the right to position (1, 3) but, unfortunately, that is a wall and I cannot make a diagonal move to the right. 

Instead, I can move down to position (1, 2) which is an empty space. Therefore, my next move will be to (1, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I am at position (1, 2), my next goal is to get closer to the goal position 'G' at (2, 1). Since the position directly below me is a wall, I cannot move down. I also cannot move left or right as those are also walls. However, I can move diagonally down and to the left to position (2, 1), which is the goal position.

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner shape". This is because the empty spaces form a roughly 90-degree angle, with one long corridor and one shorter corridor connected perpendicularly.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:
 
0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 G 0 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form an L-shape, but the position of the 'P' and 'G' and some walls have been rearranged to create a new and distinct maze. The path from 'P' to 'G' can be navigated through the empty spaces.
