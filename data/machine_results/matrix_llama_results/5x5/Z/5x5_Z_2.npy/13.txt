You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position (P) is at coordinates (0, 2).

Since the goal position (G) is at coordinates (2, 1), I'll aim to move towards it while avoiding walls.

My next move will be to the empty space immediately below the current position (P), which is at coordinates (1, 2).

So, my next move is to coordinates (1, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect this move, and I'll plan the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll plan my next move.

My current position (P) is at coordinates (1, 2). The goal position (G) is still at coordinates (2, 1).

To get closer to the goal, I'll move diagonally down and left. My next move will be to coordinates (2, 1) is blocked by a wall, but I can try to move to (2, 0) to potentially clear a path or approach from a different angle.

However, I can also attempt to move to (1, 1), which could give me a better approach.

My next move will be to coordinates (1, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(distorted) Inverted L" shape, but a more fitting description could be a "(distorted) Gamma" shape , which better represents the path.


Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming the same "(distorted) Gamma" shape:


0 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G P 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1


Wait! This maze has the positions of P and G swapped.


Let me try again:


1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
0 P 1 1 1
0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1


Now, I've managed to retain the "(distorted) Gamma" shape of the empty spaces while providing a non-identical, solvable maze with the original player and goal positions.
