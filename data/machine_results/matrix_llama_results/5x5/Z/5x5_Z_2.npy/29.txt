You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position (P) is at coordinates (0, 2).

My first move will be to move right to the adjacent empty space at coordinates (0, 3).

Next position: (0, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (0, 3), I'll move down to the adjacent empty space at coordinates (1, 3).

Wait, that's a wall! In that case, I'll move down and to the left to the adjacent empty space at coordinates (1, 2), no that's also a wall!

Let me try again. I'll move down and to the left to the adjacent empty space at coordinates (1 is not possible), I can try further left so that is (1,1) no that's a wall!

Okay, okay, so I move down multiple spaces and a bit left, so I move to (3,2).

Next position: (3, 2)

(I may adjust slightly based on actual maze presented)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A diagonal corridor or a "staircase" shape, connecting the top-left part of the maze to the bottom-right part.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

0 0 P 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 G 1
0 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a diagonal corridor or "staircase" shape, but the walls and corridors are arranged differently. The maze has the same size as the original, and there is a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
