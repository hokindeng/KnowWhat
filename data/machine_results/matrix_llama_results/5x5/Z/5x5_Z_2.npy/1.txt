You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position (0, 2), marked as 'P'. My goal is to reach position (2, 1), marked as 'G'. To do this, I will move down and to the right. However, since I can only move to empty spaces, I will move diagonally down and to the right to position (1, 3) for now. But since (1,3) is blocked, I'll move down to (1,2).

So, my next move is to position (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position (1, 2), marked as 'P'. My goal is to reach position (2, 1), marked as 'G'. To do this, I will move down and to the left. 

So, my next move is to position (2, 1) which is the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or an "L-path", considering the overall layout of the empty spaces and corridors that lead from the starting point 'P' to the goal 'G'.

Here is a new maze with the same size and a similar L-shape formed by the empty spaces:


1 1 0 0 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 G 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape that connects the starting point 'P' to the goal 'G', similar to the original maze. Note that the new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it maintains the same general shape and structure of the corridors.
