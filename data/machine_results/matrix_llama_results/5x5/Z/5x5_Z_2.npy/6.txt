You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves. 

Since I am at position (0,2) marked by 'P', my possible moves are:

* Up: Not possible, as it's out of bounds.
* Down: Possible, as the position (1,2) is an empty space marked by '0'.
* Left: Possible, as the position (0,1) is an empty space marked by '0'.
* Right: Not possible, as the position (0,3) is an empty space, but moving right won't get me closer to the goal.
* Diagonals: Not possible, as the positions are either out of bounds or are walls.

Considering the possibilities, my next move will be down to position (1,2), as this is closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1,2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and let me know the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

I am currently at position (1,2) marked by 'P'. Considering the goal position (2,1) marked by 'G', my possible moves are:

* Up: Not a good option, as it will move away from the goal.
* Down: Possible, but I would need to go around the wall to reach the goal. However, moving down will put me in a position where I can reassess.
* Left: Not possible, as the position (1,1) is a wall.
* Right: Not possible, as the position (1,3) is a wall.
* Diagonals: One diagonal move is possible - to the position (2,1) which is the goal 'G'. Since this is the goal, I will try to move diagonally.

The coordinates of my next move are: (2,1)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and let me know the updated maze. If this move is not possible (considering I can move diagonally in general), I would be happy to reassess and make a new move.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a zigzag or a sigmoid shape.

Here's a new maze that meets the specified criteria:

0 1 P 0 0
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a zigzag shape, but the maze is not an identical copy of the original. The start position (P) and the goal position (G) are placed in a way that allows for a valid path through the empty spaces.
