You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves. 

Since I am at position (0,2) marked by 'P', my possible moves are:

* Up: Not possible, as it's out of bounds.
* Down: Possible, as the position (1,2) is an empty space marked by '0'.
* Left: Possible, as the position (0,1) is an empty space marked by '0'.
* Right: Not possible, as the position (0,3) is an empty space, but moving right won't get me closer to the goal.
* Diagonals: Not possible, as the positions are either out of bounds or are walls.

Considering the possibilities, my next move will be down to position (1,2), as this is closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1,2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and let me know the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

Since I am at position (1,2) marked by 'P', my possible moves are:

* Up: Possible, as the position (0,2) is an empty space marked by '0', but this would be backtracking.
* Down: Not possible, as the position (2,2) is a wall marked by '1'.
* Left: Not possible, as the position (1,1) is a wall marked by '1'.
* Right: Not possible, as the position (1,3) is a wall marked by '1'.
* Diagonals: There is one possible diagonal move, which is to position (2,1), but this is not the best option as the goal is at (2,1)'s right.

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the goal is just below me, but it's blocked by a wall. Since I can move diagonally, I can try to move around the wall. A possible move could be to position (2,1)'s adjacent cell, (2,0) is blocked, (1,1) is also blocked. The next diagonal space, 0 1 is free.

Considering the possibilities, my best move will be to (0,1).

The coordinates of my next move are: (0,1)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and let me know the updated maze.



Let's discard going diagonally down for now.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

Since I am at position (0,1) marked by 'P', my possible moves are:

* Up: Not possible, as it's out of bounds.
* Down: Not possible, as the position (1,1) is a wall marked by '1'.
* Left: Not possible, as the position (0,0) is an empty space, but moving left won't get me closer to the goal.
* Right: Possible, as the position (0,2) is an empty space marked by '0'.
* Diagonals: Not possible, as the positions are either out of bounds or are walls.

Considering the possibilities, my next move will be to the right to position (0,2), as I'll have more opportunities to move closer to the goal from there.

However, since I was already there, this would be backtracking, but moving right to position (0,2) is my best option to progress as this is the closest position where a move down is feasible.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0,2)

Then a feasible down diagonal could put me much closer or in front of G to set me for the final.



Please update the maze to reflect my new position and let me know the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at a familiar position.

Since I am at position (0,2) marked by 'P', I will analyze the possible moves again.

As I mentioned before, my next move would be to try to move closer to the goal. I notice that the position (1,3) is not feasible, and I've already explored the left and right possibilities.

However, I can try to move diagonally down to position (1,3) or (2,2)'s adjacent cells, but they are blocked. (2,1) is feasible and empty.

The coordinates of my next move are not to (1,2), as this would be backtracking to my first move but (1,3)'s adjacent cell, which would put me in (2,1).
 This (2,1) position adjacent to (2,2), is where I can take another diagonal.


Considering the feasibility of (2,1) that gets me over the wall without wasting a move backtracking gives a better path forward.

There it is.


The coordinates of my next move are (1,2) no: (2,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L-shape" or an "Elbow shape".

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

0 0 0 1 0
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
0 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is also an L-shape or an Elbow shape, similar to the original maze. Note that this is not an identical copy of the original maze, but rather a new maze that meets the specified criteria.
