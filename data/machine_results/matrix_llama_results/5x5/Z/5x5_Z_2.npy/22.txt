You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position (P) is at coordinates (0, 2).

Since the goal position (G) is at coordinates (2, 1), I'll aim to move towards it while avoiding walls.

My next move will be to move down and a bit to the left, so my new coordinates will be (1, 2) -> no, wait, that's a wall. Then I'll move down and a bit to the right. So, my new coordinates will be (1, 3) -> no, that's also a wall.

Okay, so I will move down. My new coordinates will be (1, 2) -> no... Then I'll move down and to the left, more to the left this time. My next move will be to coordinates (1, 1) -> no...

Okay, let's just move down for now. The coordinates of my next move will be (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I've moved down, I'll now try to move closer to the goal position (G) at coordinates (2, 1). To get there, I'll try to move down and to the left.

My next move will be to coordinates (2, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would say that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is an "L-shape" or a corner shape, where the empty spaces are connected in a way that resembles the letter "L" or a 90-degree angle.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 0 0
P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 G 1
0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0

This maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is still recognizable as an "L-shape".
