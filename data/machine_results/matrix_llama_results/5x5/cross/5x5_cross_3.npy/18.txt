You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I'm starting at the position marked 'P', which appears to be at coordinates (2,1) if we consider the top left corner as (0,0), I will analyze the maze and determine the best possible next move.

Looking at the maze, the current position 'P' is surrounded by walls ('1') except for the space to the right, which is an empty space ('0'). To make progress towards the goal 'G', I need to move into that empty space.

Therefore, my next move will be to the right of my current position, to the coordinates (2,2).

Please let me know the outcome and present the updated maze.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L" shape.

The original maze has empty spaces that form an "L" shape, which can be traversed from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G'.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 P 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 G 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original, and has empty spaces that form an "L" shape.
