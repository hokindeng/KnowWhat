You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position (P) is at coordinates (2, 1) and the goal position (G) is at coordinates (4, 1). 

My first move will be down to the empty space at coordinates (3, 1). However, since I can also move diagonally, I notice that there's an empty space at coordinates (3, 2). I will move to that position instead, as it provides more opportunities for subsequent moves.

My next move is to coordinates (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 G 1 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I see that I'm currently at position (3, 2). To move closer to the goal, I can try moving down to the empty space at coordinates (4, 2), but unfortunately, there's a wall at that position.

Instead, I'll explore the possibility of moving diagonally down-left to the goal position. Since there's a wall at coordinates (4, 1) that contains the goal, I'll need to move diagonally up first and then down to the goal. However, before doing so, I should get as close to the goal as possible.

I will move to the empty space at coordinates (3, 1) that I previously skipped, which should provide an opportunity to move closer to the goal.

My next move is to coordinates (3, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 1

This new maze has the same size as the original and features an L-shaped corridor formed by the empty spaces, allowing the player to move from P to G. It is not an identical copy of the original maze but retains the same general shape.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
