You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to my current position, I'll choose a move that brings me closer to the goal. Given the maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 0 1

I will move diagonally down and to the right to the empty space (0). The coordinates of my next move will be (3, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 G 1 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 G 1 0 1

I'll move down to get closer to the goal. My next move will be to the empty space just below my current position. The coordinates of my next move will be (4, 2).

Please update the maze again!

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 0 1

I can observe that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "zigzag" or "staircase" shape.

Here's a new maze with the same size and a zigzag path:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 G 1

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and features a zigzag path formed by its empty spaces.
