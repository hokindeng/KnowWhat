You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to my current position, I'll choose a move that brings me closer to the goal. Based on the maze, my current position is (2,1), and my next move will be to the right, to the empty space at position (2,3) is blocked by a wall, so I'll choose the empty space at position (3,2). However, this is not directly adjacent to my current position. Instead, I can move diagonally to the empty space at position (3,3).

However, I will choose a different diagonal move. 

My next move will be to the position (3,1) doesn't get me closer to the goal since it is blocked by a wall, so I'll choose the position diagonally down and right (3,2) isn't an option for the same reason. However I can choose the position diagonally down and left doesn't move closer to my goal. So my move is diagonally up and right to (1,2) isn't a valid move, it is outside my movement restrictions and also blocked by a wall so my move is diagonally up left, but again that's also blocked, I am going to move diagonally to the right and downward. my next move will be to (3,2)  no my move is  P will move to (2, 2) doesn't bring me closer to the goal but (3,3), does bring me closer however is not diagonally one unit, I am going to move one down and to the right. Therefore P will now move to position (3,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 G 1 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm glad I was able to move successfully.

Since my goal is to reach the goal position (G) at the bottom of the maze, my next move will be down. However, I need to move to an empty space, so I'll move diagonally down and to the left isn't an option since there's a wall, and moving directly down isn't an option since there's a wall too. Therefore, I'll move diagonally down and to the right also is blocked so my next move will be the position to the left of the current position which isn't blocked, so the new position of P is (3,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, where the empty spaces form a similar L-shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 P 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 G 1
