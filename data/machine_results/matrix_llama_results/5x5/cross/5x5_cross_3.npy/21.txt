You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves step-by-step to reach the goal 'G' from the player position 'P'. Given that I can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space (represented by '0'), I will analyze the maze:

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 0 1
```

My current position 'P' is at coordinates (2,1), considering (0,0) as the top left corner of the maze.

The only possible move from 'P' is to the right, into the empty space at coordinates (2,3), because all other directions are blocked by walls.

So, my next move is to the coordinates (2,3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze appears to be a winding or zigzagging path that could be simplified to an 'L' shape with its corners somewhat rounded by the presence of diagonal moves, but given the straight segments, it broadly resembles an 'L' shape.


2. Here is a new maze with the same size and a path that also forms an 'L' shape, encoded in the same format as the original. I've made sure it's not an identical copy but retains the 'L' shape characteristic of the empty spaces.

```
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 1 1
```

This maze maintains the 'L' shape formed by the empty spaces, allows for a valid path from 'P' to 'G', and meets all the other specified criteria.
