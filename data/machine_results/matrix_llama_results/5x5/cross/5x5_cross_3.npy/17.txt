You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves. I start at position 'P', which is located at (2,1).

To solve the maze, I can attempt to move towards the goal 'G', but first, I need to find a path that gets me closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

Considering my current position (2,1) and the maze layout, my next move would be to move down and to the right, to position (3,2) since it is an empty space that brings me closer to the goal and avoids the wall.

However, since you asked for the next move's coordinates and given that diagonal moves are allowed, I would rather move diagonally down and to the right directly to (3,2), but since I have to provide the intermediate move given the constraint of the format and the misunderstanding of diagonal movement encoding, I will clarify this with a simple down move for the purpose of adherence to expected format. Thus:

My next move's coordinates are (3,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze appears to be an 'L-shape'.

(2) Here's a new maze with the same size and an L-shaped path:


1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 0 0 1

This new maze meets the required criteria:
- Same size as the original
- Valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Not an identical copy of the original maze
- The general shape formed by its empty spaces is an L-shape
