You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position (2,2). This position is directly below the current player position and is an empty space.


So, my next move coordinates are: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will make my next move to the position (3,1). This position is to the left and down of the current player position, is an empty space, and might bring me closer to the goal.


So, my next move coordinates are: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 P 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my current position at (3,1) and the goal at (1,3), my next move will be to the position (2,1). This position is up from the current player position and is an empty space.


However, I notice that I could get stuck if I continue moving up, so my real aim is to get to the rightmost part of the maze and then move up towards the goal.


So, my next move coordinates are: (2,1

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze:


1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1


I can identify the shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a 'cross' or an 'X' shape.


Now, I will create a new maze of the same size that meets the specified criteria. Here is the new maze:


1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 G
1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1


In this new maze, the empty spaces (corridors) still form a 'cross' or 'X' shape, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze, and a valid path from 'P' to 'G' can be found through the empty spaces.
