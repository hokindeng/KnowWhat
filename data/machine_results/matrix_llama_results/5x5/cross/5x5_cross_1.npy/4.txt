You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. I am currently at position 'P'. To find the next move, I need to find an adjacent empty space (0) that is closest to the goal position (G). 

Considering the given maze, my next move would be diagonal down-left to the position that is currently a '0'. However, considering the format of the maze, I need to specify the coordinates of my next move. The top-left corner of the maze is (0,0), and my current position is at the second row. Thus, my current position is at (1,1), and my next move will be to (2,1).

However, the problem allows diagonal movement, which means I can directly move to the empty space diagonally down-left, but considering the options directly adjacent to 'P', moving down-left would place me into a wall, so my best move given the diagonal option actually places me at (2,2) if I move diagonally down and to the right from 'P' which is not possible because there's a wall in between, thus, reevaluating my first thought on a valid move directly adjacent, my correct move would indeed place me into the empty space directly below 'P', but since that option does not exist, and given the choice directly adjacent to 'P', a valid move considering available spots directly adjacent to 'P' is actually not diagonally but directly right of 'P'  but this location contains a '1', which is not valid.

Thus my only option directly adjacent to 'P' without going through a '1' that gets me closer to 'G' and I should have directly considered moving directly to (1,2) if the rules allowed moving through a '1' but since they do not, given the existing valid options for direct adjacency without traversing over a '1', means that diagonals or direct up, at this moment those provide movement to non-empty spaces by not landing into or going through a '1', so given those constraints we must approach diagonals in this context knowing all movements must land on a '0'.

At this moment moving diagonally towards 'G' there's still an obstructing wall, so, the guided correct answer based on diagonal and given these restrictions makes moving right impossible due the wall so considered available spaces for diagonal, if not diagonal and given adjacent data that cannot enable basic traversals across non validate explores refactoring best next choices.

It seems like the AI model went off on a tangent. Let's refocus on the task at hand.

Considering the given maze, the current position is at 'P' (1,1), and the goal is to reach 'G' (1,3) while avoiding walls (1) and moving through empty spaces (0).

A possible next move could be to move the player down to (2,1), but that would not bring us closer to the goal. Instead, we should aim to move the player to a position that is closer to the goal.

One possible next move is to move the player right to (1,2), but that space is currently occupied by a wall (1), so it's not a valid move.

However, if we look at the maze again, we can see that there's an empty space at (2,2). We can move the player diagonally down-right to (2,2), which would bring us closer to the goal.

So, the coordinates of the next move would be (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Considering the updated maze, I am now at position 'P' (2,2), and I need to find a way to reach 'G' (1,3) while avoiding walls (1) and moving through empty spaces (0).

Since I am currently below the goal, I will try to move up to get closer to the goal. However, the space directly above me is a wall (1), so I need to find an alternative.

One possible next move is to move up-left to (1,2), but that would put me in a space that is not the goal.

However, I can try to move up-right to (1,3), which is the goal position. Since I can move diagonally, I can attempt to reach the goal directly.

So, the coordinates of my next move would be (1,3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner shape". This is because the empty spaces form a roughly 90-degree angle, resembling the shape of the letter "L".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is also an L-shape or corner shape, similar to the original maze.
