You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. I am currently at position 'P'. To find a valid move, I'll look for adjacent empty spaces (diagonals included). The goal 'G' seems close, but there's a wall directly between my current position and it. However, I can see a path that might lead me to the goal if I move carefully.

My current position 'P' is at coordinates (1,1), assuming the top left is (0,0). The possible moves from my position are limited due to the walls surrounding me. However, I notice that moving diagonally down and to the left could be a good start because it avoids the immediate wall to my right and leverages the empty space diagonally down-left from me as a stepping stone to further navigate the maze.

Therefore, my next move would be to the coordinates (2,0), as this position is diagonally down-left from my current position and it's an empty space, allowing me to start navigating around the walls towards the goal.

Next move: (2,0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as forming a diagonal path or a diagonal line, albeit with an additional empty space that does not directly contribute to a straightforward diagonal but offers a necessary detour to reach the goal.

Given the nature of the maze, it's more accurate to focus on the critical diagonal aspect that allows movement from the starting point towards the goal. Therefore, the shape can be seen as enabling a 'diagonal' movement or path.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (5x5) that incorporates a path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces ('0'), with the empty spaces forming a diagonal line that facilitates reaching the goal:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1

This new maze is not an identical copy of the original but maintains the diagonal path concept that allows navigation from 'P' to 'G' through adjacent empty spaces.
