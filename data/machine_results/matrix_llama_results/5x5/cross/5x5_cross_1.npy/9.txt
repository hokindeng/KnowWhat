You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position (2,2). This position is the empty space adjacent to the current player position 'P'.

The coordinates of my next move are: (2,2)

Please update the maze to reflect this new position and I will make my next move. 

Also, please note that the player 'P' should be moved to the new position and the old position should be replaced with '0'.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the position (1,2) as it's the nearest empty space adjacent to the goal position 'G' while being accessible from the current position 'P' and not blocked by a wall.

However, the correct position (1,2) is blocked by the wall, I will move to position (3,1) which is an empty space adjacent to the current player position 'P'.

The coordinates of my next move are: (3,1)

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 P 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will make my next move to the position (2,2), which is an empty space adjacent to the goal position 'G' and was visited previously, but also closest to the goal in an attempt to approach it from another angle isn't available currently so retracting steps.


However this previous empty space (2,2) adjacent to the goal is available again.
 
The coordinates of my next move are: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Back to this position again. Since I've already tried moving in other directions, I'll try a different approach. My next move will be to position (1,1) as it's the nearest empty space adjacent to both the goal position 'G' and the current player position 'P'. 

The coordinates of my next move are: (1,1)

Let's see if this leads to a path to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now closer to the goal. Since I can move diagonally, I will attempt to reach the goal position directly. My next move will be to position (1,3), which is the goal position 'G'. 

The coordinates of my next move are: (1,3)


Let's see if this finally reaches the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) an "L-shape" or an "elbow shape".

The corridors in the original maze form an L-shape, allowing the player to move from the starting position to the goal position.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape, allowing the player to navigate from the starting position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Note that this is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it retains the same general shape and structure.
