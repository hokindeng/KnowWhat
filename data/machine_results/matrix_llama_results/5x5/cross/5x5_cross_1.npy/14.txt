You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. I am currently at position 'P'. To find the available moves, I'll look for adjacent empty spaces (marked as '0') or the goal position 'G'.

Given the maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Since diagonal moves are allowed, the available moves from the current position 'P' are limited due to the walls ('1') surrounding the player. However, the goal 'G' is directly accessible since it's adjacent to 'P' and movement to 'G' is not blocked by walls.

My next move is directly to the goal 'G', which is to the right of the current position 'P'.

Current position 'P' is at (1,1) (assuming the coordinates are (row, column) starting from 0).

The goal 'G' is at (1,3).

My move will be to position (1,3).

Coordinates of my next move: (1,3)

Please update the maze with the new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze appears to be an 'L' shape (or a corner), as it consists of two connected, perpendicular corridors.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size (5x5), a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces, and an 'L' shape formed by its corridors:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 G
1 1 0 1 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces also form an 'L' shape. The position of 'P' and 'G' has been rearranged to meet the conditions of the task while maintaining the same shape of the corridors.
