You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. I am currently at position 'P'. To find a valid move, I'll analyze my surroundings.

The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (1,1). The goal 'G' is at (1,3), but it's blocked by a wall. I need to find an alternative route.

Looking at the maze, I see that the only valid move from my current position is down to the empty space. This move will bring me closer to finding a path to the goal.

My next move will be to the coordinates (2,1), which is the empty space directly below my current position.

Next move coordinates: (2,1)

Please provide the updated maze after this move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a diagonal path, but if I examine it more closely, I would say that it resembles an "L" shape. This is because there's a clear vertical segment and a horizontal segment connected in an L-like form.

(2) Here's a new maze with the same size (5x5) and a path that also forms an "L" shape:


1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1


This new maze meets the criteria: same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and its empty spaces form an "L" shape. The player can move from P to G through the L-shaped corridor.
