You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to my current position, I'll choose a move that brings me closer to the goal (G). 

My current position is (1,1) since the coordinates are (row, column) and the top-left corner is (0,0). 

I can see that there's an empty space (0) at position (2,2) that is diagonally adjacent to my current position. Moving to that space seems like the most promising option, as it reduces the distance to the goal (G) and opens up potential paths for further moves.

Therefore, I'd like to move to position (2,2). Please update the maze to reflect my new position. 

Next move coordinates: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my new position at (2,2), I'll reassess the maze to plan my next move.

I see that the goal (G) is now within reach. Since I can move diagonally, I can reach the goal directly.

I'd like to move to the goal position. 

Next move coordinates: (1,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a diagonal path.

Here is a new maze with the same size, where the empty spaces form a similar diagonal path:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 G
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the path from P to G is still a diagonal path, but it's not an identical copy of the original maze.
