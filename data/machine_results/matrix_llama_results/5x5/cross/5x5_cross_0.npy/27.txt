You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (2, 2) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (4, 3).

Since we can move to any adjacent empty space, our next move should be to an empty space that moves us closer to the goal.

Upon examining the maze, a viable next move would be to move diagonally down-right from 'P' to the empty space at coordinates (3, 3), as this brings us closer to 'G'.

So, the coordinates of my next move would be (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 P 1
1 1 0 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the updated maze. The current player position 'P' is now at coordinates (3, 3) and the goal position 'G' is still at coordinates (4, 3).

Our next move should again bring us closer to the goal. A possible move is to the empty space at coordinates (3, 2), but that would not be a step in the right direction towards the goal.

However, a viable next move would be to move down from 'P' to the empty space at coordinates (4, 2), as this allows us to potentially reach the goal in the next move.

So, the coordinates of my next move would be (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're getting close to the goal.

Let's analyze the updated maze. The current player position 'P' is now at coordinates (4, 2) and the goal position 'G' is still at coordinates (4, 3), which is right next to our current position.

To reach the goal, our next move should be to move right from 'P' to the goal position 'G' at coordinates (4, 3).

So, the coordinates of my next move would be (4, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a diagonal corridor.

Here's a new maze with the same size, where the empty spaces form a similar diagonal corridor:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 P 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 G

In this new maze, the player must navigate through the diagonal corridor to reach the goal.
