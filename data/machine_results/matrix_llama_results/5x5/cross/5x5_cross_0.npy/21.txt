You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (2, 2).

The surrounding positions are:
- Up: (1, 2) is a wall (1)
- Down: (3, 2) is a wall (1)
- Left: (2, 1) is a wall (1)
- Right: (2, 3) is a wall (1)
- Top-left: (1, 1) is a wall (1)
- Top-right: (1, 3) is a wall (1)
- Bottom-left: (3, 1) is a wall (1)
- Bottom-right: (3, 3) is an empty space (0)

Given the options, I would like to move to the bottom-right position, which is (3, 3).

So, my next move is to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 P 1
1 1 0 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze again. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (3, 3).

The surrounding positions are:
- Up: (2, 3) is a wall (1)
- Down: (4, 3) is a wall (1)
- Left: (3, 2) is a wall (1)
- Right: (3, 4) is a wall (1)
- Top-left: (2, 2) is an empty space (0)
- Top-right: (2, 4) is an empty space (0)
- Bottom-left: (4, 2) is an empty space (0)
- Bottom-right: (4, 4) is the goal (G), but there is a wall above it

Given the options, I would like to move to the top-left position, which is (2, 2) and then try to find another path, or go to the bottom-left (4, 2) and try to find a passage to the goal. However, considering I was near to the bottom-right corner, I prefer going down-left to see if I can solve it sooner.

So, my next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting close to the goal.

The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (4, 2). I can see the goal 'G' is at (4, 4), which is two positions to the right.

The surrounding positions are:
- Right: (4, 3) is a wall (1), but I can move diagonally to the goal.
- Right (two steps): (4, 4) is the goal (G), which I can try to reach diagonally or by going up first.

Considering the options, I'll try to move to the goal directly.

However, I can only move to an adjacent empty space or diagonally. In this case, I'll move right and up diagonally to see if I can avoid the wall and hope it doesn't break the rules.

No, that would be a fault. Let me reconsider and look at this maze again. I'll move one step up to create a visible path.

So, my next move is to (3, 2), since going right is a wall, going down is also outside the map.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would say that the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a "staircase" or a "zig-zag" shape.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:
```
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 G 1
```
This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces in this maze also form a staircase or zig-zag shape, similar to the original maze.
