You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (2, 2).

My first move will be down and right to the empty space '0' at coordinates (3, 3). This move is chosen because it moves closer to the goal 'G', which is located at (4, 3), and avoids walls.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position. My next position coordinates are (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 P 1
1 1 0 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position 'P' at coordinates (3, 3), I will move down and left to the empty space '0' at coordinates (4, 2). This move is chosen because it moves closer to the goal 'G' and avoids walls.

My next position coordinates are (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm close to the goal. From my current position 'P' at coordinates (4, 2), I will move right to the empty space adjacent to the goal, which would put me at coordinates (4, 3) and then I would be right next to the goal 'G'. 

However, there's no empty space at (4,3), but there is a 'G' (goal), so that must mean I can move right into it. Thus my final position will be (4, 3) but there will be a 'P' instead of 'G'.

My next position coordinates are (4, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "staircase" or "zigzag" shape.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same staircase or zigzag shape:
```
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 G
1 P 1 0 1
```
This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a staircase or zigzag shape.
