You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right of the current player position (P). This is because the only adjacent empty space is to the right, and moving there will get me closer to the goal (G).

My next move will be to the coordinates (2, 4), but since we are currently at (2,2), I will move to (2,3) which is a wall, so I will move to (2,4). Since we can only move to adjacent empty spaces, and (2,3) is a wall, I will choose (3,2) as my next step. However, I will choose to move to (2,4) in the X direction and then I will have a clear path in Y direction. Wait! We can move diagonally. In that case I can move diagonally to (3,3).

However, my first move would be: (3,3) No, I will choose to move diagonally, one step down and one to the right, to coordinates (3,3).

 Please confirm if it's correct and provide the updated maze.

 Move to (3,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 P 1
1 1 0 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I'm now closer to the goal (G). I will analyze the new position and find a path that brings me closer to (G).

Since I'm at (3,3), I can move to the adjacent empty space below me, which will bring me closer to the goal (G). However, that will lead to a wall. 

Considering my options, I will move one step down and one to the left to coordinates (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I'm now closer to the goal (G). 

Since I'm at (4,2), I can move to the right and reach the goal (G). However, the goal is at (4,4) and (4,3) is a wall. In this case, I can move diagonally up and to the right to (3,4) and then I will have a clear path to (4,4). I could also move diagonally up and to the right, to coordinates (3,4).

However, I also can move two steps in the X direction to reach (4,4). I can move to (4,3) no I am not, I can move to (4,4) but there is a wall in (4,3) so in that case I have to move around the wall to reach the goal.

 Move to (3,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "staircase" or "zigzag" shape.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same staircase or zigzag shape:
```
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G
  P
No I did it wrong I have to put the P inside the maze
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 P 1
1 1 1 0 G
```
Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it has the same size and a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is still recognizable as a staircase or zigzag shape.
