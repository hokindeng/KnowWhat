You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position (P)
The current player position (P) is at the bottom of the maze, second column from the right. Coordinates are (3, 3).

## Step 2: Identify the goal position (G)
The goal position (G) is at the second row of the maze, third column from the left. Coordinates are (1, 2).

## Step 3: Determine the possible moves from the current player position (P)
Given the current player position (P), possible moves can be up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. Since P is at (3, 3), the possible moves are (2, 3), (4, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), and (4, 4). However, due to the constraints of the maze, only (2, 3) and (3, 2) are valid moves as the others are walls.

## Step 4: Evaluate which move brings us closer to the goal (G)
The Manhattan distance from (3, 3) to (1, 2) for each possible valid move should be considered. For (2, 3), the Manhattan distance to (1, 2) is 2 (1 step up, 1 step left). For (3, 2), the Manhattan distance to (1, 2) is also 2 (2 steps up). Since both are equally distant, but moving up towards (2, 3) aligns more directly with reaching the row of the goal (G), this move seems preferable.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0
1 1 1 P 1
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position (P)
The current player position (P) is at the third row of the maze, third column from the left. Coordinates are (2, 2).

## Step 2: Identify the goal position (G)
The goal position (G) is at the second row of the maze, third column from the left. Coordinates are (1, 2).

## Step 3: Determine the possible moves from the current player position (P)
Given the current player position (P), possible moves can be up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. Since P is at (2, 2), the possible moves are (1, 2), (3, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 3). However, due to the constraints of the maze, only (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), and (1, 1) are valid moves as the others are walls or out of bounds.

## Step 4: Evaluate which move brings us closer to the goal (G)
Moving directly up to (1, 2) would place the player at the goal, making this the most direct move towards solving the maze.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze
The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze appears to be an "L" shape. This is because if you trace the path from P to G, ignoring the specific turns and focusing on the overall layout, the empty spaces roughly form an "L" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same "L" shape
Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0

This maze is not an identical copy of the original, has the same size, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and its empty spaces form a recognizable "L" shape.

The final answer is: There is no specific answer required for this question beyond the explanation provided.
