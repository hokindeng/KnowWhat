You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.


Current position (P) is at coordinates (3, 3). There is a wall above me (at (2, 3)) and to my right (at (3, 4)). The goal position (G) is at coordinates (1, 2). I can move down, left, or any of the four diagonals.


Since I am already at the bottom-most position and moving down would put me outside the maze boundaries, that option is not viable. Moving diagonally to the bottom left would put me at (4, 2), which is outside the maze boundaries. Similarly, moving diagonally to the bottom right would put me at (4, 4), which is outside the maze boundaries and also blocked by a wall.


My next best option is to move diagonally to the top left. This will put me at coordinates (2, 2), which is an empty space.


I will move to coordinates (2, 2).


My next move coordinates are (2, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as an "L-shape."


Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 1


In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape, which connects the starting position (P) at coordinates (1, 1) to the goal position (G) at coordinates (3, 3). The maze has the same size as the original and is not an identical copy.
