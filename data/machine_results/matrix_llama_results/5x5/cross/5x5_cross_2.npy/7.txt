You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). My next move will be to an adjacent empty space.

First, I need to determine the current coordinates of the player position (P). The maze is indexed starting from (0,0) at the top left corner. I identify the player position at the fourth row (since we start counting from 0) and the fourth column. Therefore, my current position is (3, 3).

Looking at the maze, I can see an empty space (0) directly above my current position. This would be a valid move. The coordinates directly above (3, 3) are (2, 3).

Therefore, my next move is to the coordinates (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0
1 1 1 P 1
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze and my current position at (2, 3), I need to plan my next move.

Analyzing the maze, I can see that the goal (G) is located two rows above my current position and one column to the left. However, moving directly to the goal is not possible because there's a wall (1) in between. But I can move to an empty space (0) that brings me closer to the goal.

One viable option is to move left to the empty space that was previously below me (before my last move). However, considering my aim is to get closer to G, I'll consider the best approach to reduce the distance.

Given the direct path to G is blocked, the next best move is to an empty space that would make my path simpler in subsequent moves. However, since diagonal moves are allowed and looking closely, moving directly to (1,2) isn't possible due to a wall but I can move one step closer to the goal by moving diagonally up and left to (1,3) isn't possible because of the wall as well but if I move diagonally up left from (2,3) to a point such as (1,2), this would be ideal but isn't allowed due to the coordinates directly leading to a 1,  not an empty space hence my choice should prioritize making distance on the y axis.

Given the restrictions, and looking for an optimal solution my move involves reducing vertical distance given it appears a bit challenging given the diagonal G is  relative to P in the maze. My actual viable alternatives considering optimal path isn't directly so diagonal to goal involves getting closer by another method, and I have I can attempt is moving left to (2,2) this is somewhat likely to my advantage to attempt this path in reducing distance up.

My next move will be to the coordinates (2, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 G
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0

This new maze has the same size as the original (5x5), includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original. The empty spaces (corridors) form an L-shape, similar to the original maze. Note that the L-shape is rotated and positioned differently in this new maze.
