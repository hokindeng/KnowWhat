You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position (P)
The current player position (P) is at coordinates (3, 3).

## Step 2: Identify the goal position (G)
The goal position (G) is at coordinates (1, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (P) at (3, 3), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are limited due to the walls and the layout of the maze. The player can only move up to (2, 3) or left to (3, 2) as these are the only adjacent empty spaces.

## Step 4: Choose the best move
The best move would be to move closer to the goal (G) which is located at (1, 2). Considering the direct path and the restrictions due to the walls, moving left to (3, 2) does not directly lead us closer to the goal because we would still need to navigate around the walls. Thus, moving up to (2, 3) provides a better starting point for the next moves as it reduces the vertical distance to the goal.

## Step 5: Update the player position
After deciding to move up, the updated player position will be (2, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0
1 1 1 P 1
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position (P)
The current player position (P) is at coordinates (2, 3).

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position (G)
The goal position (G) remains at coordinates (1, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
From the current player position (P) at (2, 3), the possible moves are limited. We can only move up to (1, 3) or left to (2, 2).

## Step 4: Choose the best move
To get closer to the goal (G) at (1, 2), moving left to (2, 2) is the best choice. This move brings the player closer to the goal both vertically and horizontally, setting up for a potential direct path to the goal in the next move.

## Step 5: Update the player position
After deciding to move left, the updated player position will be (2, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
Upon examining the original maze, the empty spaces (corridors) form a shape that can be described as an "L" shape or a corner shape, connecting the start point (P) to the goal (G).

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same size and shape of empty spaces
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to design it with the same size (5x5) and include a path from P to G that forms an "L" shape. The new maze should not be an identical copy of the original and should allow for a valid path through empty spaces.

## Step 3: Design the new maze
Here is a new 5x5 maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 G 1 1

This new maze maintains the "L" shape formed by the empty spaces, connecting P to G, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze.

The final answer is:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 G 1 1
