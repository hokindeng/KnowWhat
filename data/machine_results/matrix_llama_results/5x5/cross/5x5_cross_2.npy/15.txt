You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (3,3), and the goal position is at (1,2). Since we can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, I will try to get closer to the goal.

After examining the maze, I see that there is an empty space at (3,2), adjacent to the current player position. This move will get me closer to the goal while avoiding the walls.

My next move will be to position (3,2). 

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and let me know if it is correct or not.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is an "L" shape. 

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "L" shape:


1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0

Note that while this new maze is not an identical copy of the original, the empty spaces form a recognizable "L" shape, and there is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces.
