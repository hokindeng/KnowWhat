You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
P 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I'm starting at the position 'P', my current coordinates are (4, 0).

After examining the maze, I see that my next possible move is to move up to the empty space directly above me.

Therefore, my next move is to the coordinates (3, 0) and then to (3,1) or (3, 2) are not possible, but I can move to (3, 0) and then to (2,0), also there is another possibility to move directly to (3, 2) but in the case I have to check the possibility to move in 2 steps I would move to (3, 0) then (2, 0). 

To minimize the steps I choose the coordinates (3,2) but passing threw the wall is not allowed, but moving directly to the position is allowed as the question, however, state that we can move in any of the 8 directions including diagonal which makes the coordinates (3, 2) a valid move.

Given these considerations, my chosen next move is (3,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is an "L" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size, where the empty spaces form a similar "L" shape:


1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
P 1 1 1 1


In this new maze, the empty spaces also form an "L" shape, and there is a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through these empty spaces. The maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but the shape formed by its corridors is recognizable as an "L" shape.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
