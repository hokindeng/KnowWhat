You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
P 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I'm starting at the position marked 'P' at the bottom left of the maze, and I want to avoid walls (represented by '1'), my next move would be to the right, towards the empty space. Given the coordinates start at (0,0) at the top-left corner, my current position is (4,0). My next move will be to (4,1), where there's an empty space ('0').

My move is to the coordinates: (4,1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) The general shape is a diagonal path with an L-shaped bend.

This is because the original maze has a clear diagonal path from the top-right to the bottom-left, with an L-shaped bend at the middle.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
G 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
P 0 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces (corridors) form the same diagonal path with an L-shaped bend. Note that the maze is not an identical copy of the original, but the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as the same diagonal path with an L-shaped bend.
