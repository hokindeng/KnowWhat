You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
P 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position (4, 2). The coordinates represent the row and column, with (0,0) being the top left corner of the maze.

In the given maze, my current position is (4, 0). Moving to (4, 2) is a valid move as it is an empty space adjacent to my current position.

So, my next move is to (4, 2).

Here's how the maze will look like after my move (imagining I've moved, not the actual updated maze):

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 1 P 1 1

Please update the maze and provide it to me again so I can plan my next move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "C shape" or "curved tunnel" but more loosely can be described as an 'L shape'. When empty spaces are visualized together, they appear as a corner of corridors or an 'L'.

(2) Here is a new maze with empty spaces that form the same 'L' shape:


1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
P 1 1 1 1

This new maze is the same size as the original, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an 'L' or "corner of corridors". The maze has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces and is not an identical copy of the original maze.
