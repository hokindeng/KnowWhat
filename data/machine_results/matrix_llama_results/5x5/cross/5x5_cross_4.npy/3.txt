You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
P 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. My current position is at (4,0) marked with 'P'. I need to move towards the goal position (2,0) marked with 'G'.

After analyzing the maze, I see that I can move diagonally or directly up to get closer to the goal. However, since there is a wall directly above me, I will move diagonally up and to the right to the empty space at (3,1).

My next move will be to the coordinates (3,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I see that I'm now at (3,1) marked with 'P'. The goal position is still at (2,0) marked with 'G'.

Since there is a wall above me and to my left, I will move to the left is blocked, I will move diagonally up and to the left to get closer to the goal. I will move to the coordinates (2,1) but since there is a wall there, that path is blocked. Instead, I can move up to the empty space at (2,1) doesn't work, I will move diagonally up and left but only one step left to (3,0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
G 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
P 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and forms an L-shape with its corridors. Note that the exact path and wall placement are different from the original maze, but the overall shape of the corridors remains the same.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
