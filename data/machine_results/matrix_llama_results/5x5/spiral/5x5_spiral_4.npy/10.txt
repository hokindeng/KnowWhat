You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (1, 0), marked by 'P'. The goal position is at (4, 0), marked by 'G'. 

I will move to (0, 0) to explore the maze and try to find a path to the goal.

My next move will be to (0, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect this new position and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

Currently, I am at position (0, 0). I will move down to position (1, 0), which is an empty space.

My next move will be to (1, 0).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at position (1, 0), I'll move right to position (1, 4), which is the empty space on the same row.

However, I realize that there's a wall between my current position and the empty space at (1, 4), so I'll move to position (1, 4) by navigating through the empty spaces above the wall. I will move to (0, 4) first and then move down.

So, my next move will be to (0, 4).

Please update the maze accordingly.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or an "L-path." This is because the empty spaces form a clear and continuous path from the top-left to the bottom-right, with a shape resembling the letter L.

Here's a new maze that meets the specified criteria:

0 1 1 1 0
P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1
G 1 1 1 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape, and there is a valid path from the starting position (P) to the goal position (G) through empty spaces. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, and it meets the same size and encoding requirements.
