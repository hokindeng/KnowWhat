You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position (1,0), marked by 'P'. My goal is to reach position (4,0), marked by 'G'. 

To navigate through the maze without hitting walls, I need to avoid positions marked by '1'. I observe that there is a wall to my right (positions (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3) are all '1'). 

My possible next moves are up or down. However, since my goal is below me, moving down seems more promising.

Therefore, my next move will be to the position (2,0). 

Move coordinates: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I've moved to position (2,0), and I'll analyze my next possible moves. 

Since there's a wall to my right (position (2,1) is '1'), my possible next moves are up, down, or right (but only to the third column, as the second column has a wall). 

However, moving up would bring me back to my previous position, which doesn't seem productive. 

I observe that moving down would put me closer to the goal ('G'). 

Therefore, my next move will be to the position (3,0).

Move coordinates: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to position (3,0). 

Again, I have a wall to my right (position (3,1) is '1'). My possible next moves are up, down, or right (but only to the third column, as the second column has a wall). 

Since my goal is to reach position (4,0), moving down seems the most promising option. 

However, I also notice that the path to the right, through the third column, appears open and might provide an alternative route to the goal if moving down doesn't work out. 

But for now, I'll prioritize the more direct path and try moving down.

Move coordinates: (4,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "S-shape" or a "zigzag". The path from P to G involves navigating through an S-shaped corridor that avoids the walls.

Here's a new maze with the same size and S-shaped corridor:

0 0 0 1 0
P 0 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 0
G 0 0 1 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an S-shaped corridor that allows the player to navigate from P to G while avoiding the walls. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it retains the same S-shaped structure.
