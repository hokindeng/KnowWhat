You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (1,0).

After analyzing the maze, I decided to move down to the empty space at coordinates (2,0).

My next move is: (2,0).

Please update the maze accordingly and let me know the new state of the maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (2,0).

I notice that I can move right to the empty space at coordinates (2,1) but that would lead me to a dead-end. Instead, I'll move down to the empty space at coordinates (3,0).

My next move is: (3,0).

Please update the maze accordingly and let me know the new state of the maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current player position (P) is at coordinates (3,0).

I notice that I'm getting closer to the goal (G), but there's a wall in between. I'll move right to the empty space at coordinates (3,1), trying to find a way around the wall.

My next move is: (3,1).

Please update the maze accordingly and let me know the new state of the maze.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "S-shape" or a "zigzag path".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same S-shape:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 0
G 1 1 0 0

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it has the same size and a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces also form an S-shape or zigzag path, similar to the original maze.
