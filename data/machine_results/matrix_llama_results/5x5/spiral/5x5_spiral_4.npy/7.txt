You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Current player position (P) is at coordinates (1,0).
My goal is to move to the goal position (G) at coordinates (4,0).

Upon examining the maze, I notice that I can move in two possible directions from my current position: up or right. Moving up would lead me to an empty space at coordinates (0,0). Moving right is blocked by a wall.

Therefore, I decide to move up to the empty space. 

My next move is to coordinates (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at the top row of the maze at coordinates (0,0). I'll examine the current state and plan my next move.

My goal is still to move to the goal position (G) at coordinates (4,0).

From my current position, I can move right. Since the goal is to reach the bottom row, I should try to move down as soon as possible. However, moving down directly is blocked by a wall. Therefore, I will try to find an alternative path by moving right first.

My next move is to coordinates (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved one step to the right and I'm now at coordinates (0,1). My goal remains the same: to reach the goal position (G) at coordinates (4,0).

Since I'm trying to find a path down, I'll examine the maze below me. It seems that the wall stretches down, blocking my direct path. I'll try to move further right to see if I can find an opening to move down.

My next move is to coordinates (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved another step to the right and I'm now at coordinates (0,2). 

Upon re-examining the maze, I notice that I can move further right or try to move down. However, since the wall below me still blocks my direct path down, I'll attempt to move further right.

But then I notice that I can also move right two more times, and then I will be above a gap in the wall, which would allow me to move down. Let's move right.

My next move is to coordinates (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved another step to the right and I'm now at coordinates (0,3).

My plan from the previous step is still on track: I'll move right one more time, and then I'll be above the gap in the wall, which will allow me to move down.

I'll move right one more step. 

My next move is to coordinates (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've reached the rightmost edge of the maze at coordinates (0,4).

As planned, I can now see that I'm directly above the gap in the wall below me. I can move down through this gap, making progress towards the goal.

My next move is to coordinates (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 P
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved down to coordinates (1,4).

Since the gap in the wall allowed me to move down, my next goal is to find a way to move further down. However, I notice that there's a wall to my left, and moving right is not possible since I'm at the edge of the maze. But I can move down through another gap that is two steps to my left.

I'll move left to position myself above the next gap. 

My next move is to coordinates (1,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "S-shape" or a "sigmoid curve".


Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same S-shape:


0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 0 0


This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and features an S-shaped corridor formed by the empty spaces.
