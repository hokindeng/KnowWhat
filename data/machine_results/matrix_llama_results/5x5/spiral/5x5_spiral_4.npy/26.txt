You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (1,0).

After analyzing the maze, I find that the only possible move is to move up, since moving down, left, or right would put me into a wall or out of bounds.

However, since I am already at the topmost row where I can be (considering the top row is at y-coordinate 0), I can move to an adjacent position that is also in the first column but is closer to the top. So, my next move would be to move up to (0,0).

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I'm now at position (0,0).

Looking at the maze, I can see that the next possible move is to the right, since moving up is not possible (as I'm already at the top edge), and moving down or left is blocked by a wall or the edge of the maze.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,1).

From this position, I can see that I have two options: I can move right again to (0,2), or I can move down to (1,1).

However, moving down to (1,1) is not possible as there is a wall ('1') at that position.

Therefore, my next move will be to the right, to position (0,2).

The coordinates of my next move are (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,2).

Looking at the maze, I can see that the next possible move is to the right, since moving up is not possible (as I'm already at the top edge), moving down is blocked by a wall, and moving left would take me backward.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,3).

Looking at the maze, I can see that moving right would put me at a position (0,4) that is on the edge of the maze but does allow a next move downwards, while moving left would take me backward. 

Moving downwards is not possible from (0,3) but is possible from (0,4). Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,4).

From this position, I can see that the next possible move is down to (1,4), since moving up is not possible (as I'm already at the top edge), moving right is not possible (as I'm already at the right edge), and moving left would take me backward.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 P
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (1,4).

Looking at the maze, I can see that I have no other options but to move down, as moving up would put me back at the starting position and moving left or right is blocked by a wall.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (2,4) but that is blocked by a wall and going to (2,3) is possible so my next move will be (2,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(broadly but roughly) 'inverted C' or a ' wrapper-around' shape" or roughly "inverted big square box open to the left side" or to make it simpler from another point of view as 'gun shape'.


Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same general shape:


0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 1 0 0
0 1 1 0 0
G 0 0 0 0


This new maze meets the criteria of having the same size as the original maze, including a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and not being an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by the empty spaces in this new maze can also be described as an '(inverted) big square box open to the left side' or roughly similar  "gun shape" or roughly like inverted C since rotate the character in 90 degree left fliping during rotation or flipping makes an evoke into user with verstile chaos preventing debunk cause ongoing general context broadly in no their side reality
