You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (1,0).

After analyzing the maze, I will choose to move down to the empty space.

The coordinates of my next move are (2,0).

Please update the maze and let me know the next state.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (2,0).

Since I'm blocked by a wall on the right, I will choose to move right to the empty space two steps to the right.

The coordinates of my next move are (2,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "S-shape" or a "sigmoid curve". This shape is characterized by a curved path that initially moves in one direction, then bends and moves in the opposite direction, creating an S-like shape.

Here is a new maze with the same size as the original, with empty spaces that form an S-shape:


0 1 1 0 0
P 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 1
0 0 1 0 0
G 0 1 1 0

This new maze has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and its corridors form a recognizable S-shape. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it retains the same general shape.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
