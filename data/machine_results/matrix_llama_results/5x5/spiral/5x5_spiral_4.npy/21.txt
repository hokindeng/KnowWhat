You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the empty space above the current position 'P'. This move will take me to the coordinates (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will make my next move downwards to the empty space below the current position 'P', but since there's a wall (1) below the current position, I will search for an alternative.

Upon reviewing the maze, I see that the rightmost path is cleared of obstacles, but since my current goal is to move down, I need to find a path that will allow me to move downwards.

One possible solution is to backtrack and explore other options, however given the maze layout, I notice that there's no clear downwards path from the top row. A better solution is to move downwards using the leftmost path. Since I'm at the rightmost edge of the maze, I will first move to the leftmost edge of the maze by moving left until I reach a safe position to move downwards.

My next move will be to the coordinates (0,3), beginning my move to the left.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing my plan to move to the leftmost edge of the maze, I will make my next move to the coordinates (0,2), further moving to the left.

My next move will be to the coordinates (0,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a "bent rectangle".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:
```
0 0 0 0 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 0
```
This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and forms an L-shape with its empty spaces.
