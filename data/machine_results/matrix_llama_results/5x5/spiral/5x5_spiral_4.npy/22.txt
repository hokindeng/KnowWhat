You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (1,0).

Since we can move in the up, down, left, or right direction, we can explore the adjacent positions:

- Up: Not possible, as moving up would put us out of the maze boundaries.
- Down: There's a wall ('1') at (2,0), so moving down is not possible.
- Left: Moving left is also not possible, as it would put us out of the maze boundaries.
- Right: There's a wall ('1') at (1,1), so moving right is not possible directly to the right.

However, moving up to (0,0) is a viable option since it's an empty space and the only possible move from the current position.

The coordinates of my next move would be (0,0).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current position 'P' at (0,0).

Since we can move in the up, down, left, or right direction, we can explore the adjacent positions:

- Up: Not possible, as moving up would put us out of the maze boundaries.
- Down: There's an empty space ('0') at (1,0), which is a viable option.
- Left: Not possible, as moving left would put us out of the maze boundaries.
- Right: There's an empty space ('0') at (0,1), which is also a viable option.

I will choose to move right to (0,1), as this will keep me on the top row, giving me more flexibility for future moves and potential access to other paths.

The coordinates of my next move would be (0,1).

Please update the maze accordingly.

- Down: There's a wall ('1') at (1,1), so moving down is not possible.
- Left: There's an empty space ('0') at (0,0), which is a viable option, but moving left would backtrack, so I'll avoid it for now.
- Right: There's an empty space ('0') at (0,2), which is a viable option.

I will choose to move right to (0,2), as this will keep me on the top row, giving me more flexibility for future moves and potential access to other paths.

- Down: There's a wall ('1') at (1,2), so moving down is not possible.

I will choose to move right to (0,3), as this will keep me on the top row, giving me more flexibility for future moves and potential access to other paths.

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Since we can move in the up, down, left, or right direction, we can explore the adjacent positions:

- Up: Not possible, as moving up would put us out of the maze boundaries.
- Down: There's a wall ('1') at (1,3), so moving down is not possible.
- Left: There's an empty space ('0') at (0,2), which is a viable option, but moving left would backtrack, so I'll avoid it for now.
- Right: There's an empty space ('0') at (0,4), which is a viable option.

I will choose to move right to (0,4), as this will keep me on the top row, giving me more flexibility for future moves and potential access to other paths.

The coordinates of my next move would be (0,4).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P

0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current position 'P' at (0,4).

Since we can move in the up, down, left, or right direction, we can explore the adjacent positions:

- Up: Not possible, as moving up would put us out of the maze boundaries.
- Down: There's a wall ('1') at no position directly below (1,4) isn't a wall, however the current position for 'G' indicates the path is likely not going to work; nonetheless  (1,4) is  a '0' so moving down is a viable option. 
- Left: There's an empty space ('0') at (0,3), which is a viable option, but moving left would backtrack, so I'll avoid it for now.
- Right: Not possible, as moving right would put us out of the maze boundaries.

I will choose to move down to (1,4), as this is the only viable move that doesn't backtrack.

The coordinates of my next move would be (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 P
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current position 'P' at (1,4).

Since we can move in the up, down, left, or right direction, we can explore the adjacent positions:

- Up: There's an empty space ('0') at (0,4), which is a viable option, but moving up would backtrack, so I'll avoid it for now.
- Down: There's a wall ('1') or some similar impenetrable barrier at a position (further down in the maze or one could say outside the labyrinth itself).
- Left: There's a wall ('1') at (1,3), so moving left is not possible.
- Right: Not possible, as moving right would put us out of the maze boundaries.

However moving down to (2,4) seems viable if we continue past the map presented. Noticing the existence of G at a lower Y axis at (4,0) could potentially mean a path of down and left movements would deliver progress towards G.

Considering this the down Y axis   Variable movement method holds the most promise at escaping toward a lower level.


The coordinates of my next move would be (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 P
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current position 'P' at (2,4) then corrected (2,3).

Since we can move in the up, down, left, or right direction, we can explore the adjacent positions:

- Up: Not possible, as there is a '1' at (1,3), so moving up is not viable.
- Down: There's a wall ('1') at (3,3) position is indeed occupied with a '1' and there might be '1's located elsewhere around the spot.
- Left: There's a '0' at (2,2), which is a viable option.
- Right: Not viable option possible, because the wall to right ('1') exists within this scenariorecated.wall observed at original movement point, direction.

However, to reach 'G', it seems moving down the left path may help navigate the maze as it eventually removes enough distance hence making the gap much closer to  G Which Y axis-wise has fewer stair(maze)-cases(floors Y-riser Eden Åš units-related expansion).

The coordinates of my next move would be (2,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "inverted U" or an "inverted arch" shape.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

0 0 0 0 0
P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 G
0 1 0 1 1

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it has the same size and a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, forming an inverted U shape.
