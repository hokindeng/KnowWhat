You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (1,0).

After analyzing the maze, I find that the only possible move is to move up, since moving down, left, or right would put me into a wall or out of bounds.

However, since I am already at the topmost row where I can be (considering the top row is at y-coordinate 0), I will move left, since that space is empty.

My next move will be to coordinates (0,0).

Please update the maze and let me know the next state.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

My current position (P) is at coordinates (0,0).

Since my goal is to reach the goal position (G) at coordinates (4,0) and I am at the leftmost column, I will move down along the leftmost column, which appears to be a viable path.

However, I notice that moving directly down would put me into a wall or a position that would lead to a dead-end.

After examining the maze, I find that I can move to the right to coordinates (0,1) and explore other possible paths.

But that is not the most optimal move.

Instead, I can move down to (1,0), and find a path from there.

No, that is still not the best next move.

My next move will be to coordinates (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

My current position (P) is at coordinates (0,1).

Since the goal is to reach the goal position (G) at coordinates (4,0) and I am currently at the top row, I need to find a way to move down.

Moving directly down would put me into a wall. However, I can move right to coordinates (0,2), (0,3), or (0,4).

These moves do not bring me closer to the goal immediately, but they are potential steps in finding a path to the goal.

My next move will be to coordinates (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

My current position (P) is at coordinates (0,2).

Since my goal is to reach the goal position (G) at coordinates (4,0) and I am at the top row, I need to find a way to move down.

I can continue moving right to coordinates (0,3) or (0,4), but I would still be at the top row.

Alternatively, I can try to find a gap in the wall below to move down. 

I will move right to coordinates (0,3), and see if I can find a path down.

My next move will be to coordinates (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

My current position (P) is at coordinates (0,3).

Since my goal is to reach the goal position (G) at coordinates (4,0), I need to find a way to move down.

Moving right would take me to the rightmost part of the maze, which does not appear to be a promising path.

Moving left would put me back in a position I've already been, so I want to explore moving down.

Looking at the rows below, I see that I can move down to coordinates (1,3), but that would put me into a wall.

However, I notice that there is a gap in the wall at column 2 ( coordinates (1,2), (2,2), and (3,2) are not walls).

My next move will be to move left to coordinates (0,2) to try to reach that gap.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at coordinates (0,2).

I want to move down to reach the gap in the wall at column 2.

Moving down to coordinates (1,2) would put me into a wall.

However, I can move down to coordinates (1,1) and then potentially move right to the gap in the wall.

But, a more direct move would be to move down to coordinates (1,2) but since that is a wall I'll move right first. Then down.

My next move will be to move right to (0,3) no, wait, my next move will be down and to the right which means I will move down one, and then to the right one, my next actual move is down one. 

My next move will be to coordinates (1,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "S-shape" or a "sigmoid curve", but a more fitting description is that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "path that follows the perimeter."

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 P 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 G 1 1 0


In this new maze, the empty spaces form a path that follows the perimeter, similar to the original maze. The maze has the same size as the original, and there is a valid path from P to G that can be reached through the empty spaces.
