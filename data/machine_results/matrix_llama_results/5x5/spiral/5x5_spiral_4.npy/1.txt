You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the empty space above the current position 'P'. Therefore, my next move will be to the coordinates (0,1).

Please update the maze to reflect the new position and present it to me again. 

Note: Since indexing starts at 0, my coordinates (0,1) mean the second column of the first row.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will make my next move to the empty space to the left of the current position 'P'. Therefore, my next move will be to the coordinates (0,0). 

Please update the maze to reflect the new position and present it to me again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I am now at the leftmost edge of the maze, I will make my next move downwards to the empty space below the current position 'P'. Therefore, my next move will be to the coordinates (1,0).

Please update the maze to reflect the new position and present it to me again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I am now back at the starting row, I will continue to move downwards to the empty space below the current position 'P'. Therefore, my next move will be to the coordinates (2,0).

Please update the maze to reflect the new position and present it to me again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at the third row, I notice that the path to the right is blocked, but the path downwards is still open through a gap between the walls. However, I also see an opportunity to move to the right, into the gap between the walls, on the same row that I'm currently on. My next move will be to the coordinates (2,2).

Please update the maze to reflect the new position and present it to me again.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "zigzag" or "serpentine" path.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag shape:


0 1 0 0 0
P 0 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 1 0 0
G 1 1 0 1

In this new maze, the path from P to G follows a zigzag pattern, winding through the empty spaces between the walls. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it has the same size and a recognizable zigzag shape formed by its corridors.
