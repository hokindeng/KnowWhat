You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will start by identifying the current player position (P) and analyzing the available moves. The current player position is at coordinates (1, 0).

From this position, I can see that there is a wall to the right, so moving right is not a viable option. However, there is an empty space above and below the current position.

I will choose to move up to the empty space above the current position. The coordinates of my next move would be (0, 0) -> (0, 1 is not a good move since I am already at the first column which is column 0)  no, I am moving to the 0th row from the 1st row so my next move would be (0, 0).

To simplify the answer I will just provide the row and column, in this case: 
0 0

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I can see that the current player position (P) is now at coordinates (0, 0). My next goal is to move closer to the goal position (G), which is located at the bottom of the maze.

From my current position, I can move right to the adjacent empty space. The coordinates of my next move would be (0, 1).

So, my next move is:
0 1

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (0, 1), I can move right to the adjacent empty space. The coordinates of my next move would be (0, 2).

So, my next move is:
0 2

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (0, 2), I can see that there is a wall below, but the space to the right is empty. However, I can also see that moving down will eventually be necessary to reach the goal (G), and there is an empty space below at a column position of 0 or 4 that I can aim for in the next few moves.

I will move right for now. The coordinates of my next move would be (0, 3).

So, my next move is:
0 3

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (0, 3), I can move right to the adjacent empty space, but this will put me in a dead end with no clear path down to the goal (G). So, I'll look for an alternative.

I can move down, but not directly. To do so, I'll move back to the left until I reach an empty space that allows me to move down.

However, since moving back would be counterproductive, I'll move to the remaining available empty space to the right for now and I'll try to move down later. 

The coordinates of my next move would be (0, 4).

So, my next move is:
0 4

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (0, 4), I can now move down to the adjacent empty space below me.

However, I notice there is no empty space directly below my current position. I need to move left until I reach a column with an empty space below.

My goal is to navigate down towards the goal (G). To do so, I'll need to move left to column 0.

I'll move left to (0, 3) no...  all the way to column 0 would be a better move 

However I should provide the new position that I want to occupy not the old one and that is (1, 0) no...  but all the way down I can go, which isn't possible since I can only go one step at the time. Looking ahead it seems going to the 4th row is not possible right now.

Let's get as far down as possible to row 1 
The coordinates of my next move would be (1, 4).

So, my next move is:
1 4

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 P
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (1, 4), I can now move left to the adjacent empty space.

I notice that there is an empty space in column 0 of row 2, 3, and 4 down below. However, to get there, I would need to navigate past the wall in column 1 that blocks my path.

My best move right now is to move left until I can go down.

The coordinates of my next move would be (1, 3).

So, my next move is:
1 3

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag" or a "meandering" path.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zig-zag shape:


0 1 1 0 0
0 0 P 1 0
0 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 1 G
0 1 1 0 0

Note that this new maze has a similar zig-zag shape to the original, but with some differences in the exact layout of the walls and empty spaces. The path from P to G is still a meandering one, requiring the solver to navigate through a series of turns to reach the goal.
