You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position (P) is at (1,0). To find a solution, I will employ a basic strategy of moving towards the goal (G) while avoiding walls.

For the next move, I will move down to the empty space below the player position. The new coordinates will be (2,0).

Next move coordinates: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2,0), I'll move down again to the empty space below the player position. However, I notice that if I move down, I will eventually hit a wall. To avoid that, I should start moving to the right when possible.

For now, I can move down to the empty space below the player position. The new coordinates will be (3,0).

Next move coordinates: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3,0), moving down will put me into a wall. Since I've reached a point where I'm adjacent to a wall, I need to start moving to the right to find an empty space that will help me progress.

I'll move to the right from the current position (3,0) to the empty space. The new coordinates will be (3,1) and then potentially continue to the right.

However, given that I will always pick a direction and stick to it as long as there isn't a wall immediately adjacent to the player and in the chosen direction, I choose right.

Next move coordinates: (3,1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(modified or irregular) zig-zag or staircase".


Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

0 1 0 0 0
P 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 0
G 0 1 1 0

This maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and has a general shape that resembles a zig-zag or staircase.
