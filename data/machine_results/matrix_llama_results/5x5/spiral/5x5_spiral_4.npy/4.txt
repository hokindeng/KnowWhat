You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the empty space above the current position 'P'. This move will be to the coordinates (0,1), since the current position 'P' is at coordinates (1,0).

Next move: (0,1) 

Please update the maze accordingly, and I will make the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the empty space to the right of the current position 'P'. This move will be to the coordinates (0,2).

Next move: (0,2) 

Please update the maze accordingly, and I will make the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the empty space to the right of the current position 'P'. This move will be to the coordinates (0,3).

Next move: (0,3)

Please update the maze accordingly, and I will make the next move

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the empty space to the right of the current position 'P'. This move will be to the coordinates (0,4).

Next move: (0,4) 

Please update the maze accordingly, and I will make the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've reached the right edge of the maze, I'll start moving down. With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the empty space below the current position 'P'. This move will be to the coordinates (1,4).

Next move: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 P
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving down. With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the empty space below the current position 'P', but since there's a wall, I'll move to the space below the wall adjacent to the current position 'P'. However, this also has a wall, so I will make my next move to the empty space that is on the same row as the second wall but on the column of 'P'. This move will be to the coordinates (3 does not work and 2,4 does).

 Next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 P
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the empty space below the current position 'P', but again, there's a wall, so I'll move down another row to the space on the same column, since that space is empty. This move will be to the coordinates does not work so (4,4).

Next move: (4,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a "bent tunnel".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:
```
0 0 0 0 0
P 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0 1
0 1 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 0
```
This new maze meets the criteria:

* Same size as the original maze (5x5)
* Includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
* Not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape or a bent tunnel.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
