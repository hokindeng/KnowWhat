You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To solve the maze, I will apply a basic pathfinding strategy. Since my goal is to reach 'G' and I can only move in four directions (up, down, left, right) through empty spaces ('0'), my first move should be towards a position that brings me closer to 'G' or at least does not block my future moves.

Given the initial maze:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

My current position 'P' is at (4,1). The goal 'G' is at (3,4).

To move closer to 'G', I will move up, because moving directly left is blocked by a wall ('1'), and moving right does not directly bring me closer to 'G'. Moving down is not an option since it moves away from 'G'.

Therefore, my next move is up, to position (3,1).

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the maze is a "zig-zag".

2. Here's a new maze that has the same size, includes a valid path from P to G, and has its empty spaces forming a zig-zag shape:

0 0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 G
1 P 0 0 0

This new maze maintains the zig-zag shape of the corridors, while not being an identical copy of the original.
