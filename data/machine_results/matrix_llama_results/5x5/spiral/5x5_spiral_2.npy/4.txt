You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G', my first move will be up.

The current position of 'P' is (4,1). Moving up means decreasing the y-coordinate by 1. Therefore, my next position will be (4,0) -> (3,1) is not possible as it's a wall, so I'll move to an empty space, but given my column, I can move up to (3 is not valid, so my next move is not up in this case, is left).

However, my correct move is left as I am trying to find a way to move up.

The correct coordinates of my next move will be (4,0).

Please provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, my next move will be up, as I am trying to find a way to navigate towards the goal position 'G'.

The current position of 'P' is (4,0). Moving up means decreasing the y-coordinate by 1, and the x-coordinate will remain the same. Therefore, my next position will be (3,0).

The coordinates of my next move will be (3,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, my next move will be left. I will try to find a path around the wall that is blocking my direct access to the goal position 'G'.

The current position of 'P' is (3,0). Moving left means decreasing the x-coordinate by 1, and the y-coordinate will remain the same. Therefore, my next position will be (3,-1) is not valid as we start at 0, so it's (3 is actually my y and I am at the 0 in this case x = 0). My next position will be (3 is y so that stays the same 3 and x is 0 I am at 0 and I move one left there is no -1, only one option 0 to 0).



  As I try to move left but I already am in the most left possible location, My correct move will be right, trying to find the correct path.

 The coordinates of my next move will be (3,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(modified or deformed) U-shape" or more generally, a serpentine shape that resembles an inverted U-shape or a curved tube.


Here is a new maze that meets the requirements:


0 1 1 0 0
0 1 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 G
P 1 1 1 0
