You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move. 

Current player position (P) is at (4,0). My goal (G) is at (3,4). 

To reach the goal, I should try to move up towards the goal. The closest empty space above P is at (3,0), but I should also consider the fact that I need to navigate around the walls.

I will move to (3,0) for now.

My next move: (3,0)

Please provide the updated maze with my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3,0), my next step is to move right. However, there is a wall at (3,1), so I should try to navigate around it.

The closest empty space that is one step closer to the goal is at (2,0). Moving up will allow me to navigate around the wall.

My next move: (2,0)

Please provide the updated maze with my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (2,0). I can see an empty space to my right at (2,2) that will allow me to make progress towards the goal while navigating around the wall.

My next move: (2,2)

Please provide the updated maze with my new position and the P marker moved accordingly to reflect the new position (2,2), which should be "P 1 0 P 0" on the third row, as "P" would then occupy the third column.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I can see that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is an "L-shape" or a right angle, as the corridors form two distinct paths that meet at a corner.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 0
P 0 0 1 G
1 1 1 0 0

This new maze has the same size as the original, a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is still recognizable as an L-shape.
