You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position (P) is at (4,1). The goal position (G) is at (3,4). 

The possible moves from the current position are up, left, right, or down. However, moving up is not possible due to the wall above. 

Considering the options, I would recommend moving the player to the right, which would result in a new position at (4,2). This is because there are empty spaces to the right, and this move could lead us closer to the goal. 

Therefore, my next move would be to (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4,2), I have several possible moves. I can move up, left, right, or down. 

Moving left would put me back in the previous position, which wouldn't be helpful. Moving up is not possible due to the wall. Moving right would position me at (4,3) which is an empty space. Moving down is also possible and would position me at (5,2) but that would move me away from the goal. 

Therefore, my next move would be to (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4,3), I can move up, left, right, or down. Moving right is not possible due to the wall. Moving down would take me further away from the goal. 

I should move up to get closer to the goal. However, moving directly up from the current position would hit a wall. I should move left to an empty space and then try to move up.

My next move would be to (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back to a familiar position. From the current position (4,2), I can move up, left, right, or down. 

Moving right would put me back in the previous position. Moving down is not helpful. Moving left is also not helpful as it would take me away from the goal.

My only option is to try to move up. I will attempt to move up to (3,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 G
0 P 0 1 0

This new maze has the same size as the original and features an L-shaped corridor formed by the empty spaces, allowing for a valid path from P to G. It is not an identical copy of the original maze.
