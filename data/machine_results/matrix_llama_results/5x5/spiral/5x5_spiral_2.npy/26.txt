You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. First, let's identify the current position of 'P', which is at (4, 1) since indexing starts at 0.

Given the constraints and the objective, the next move should be towards the goal while avoiding walls. Since I can move in any of the four directions (up, down, left, right) to an adjacent empty space, the best initial move from (4, 1) would be to go right, as moving up is blocked by a wall, down doesn't make sense since the goal is upwards, and left is also not towards the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move from (4, 1) would be to (4, 2), moving right.

Please update the maze accordingly to reflect my new position and let me know the new state of the maze for my next decision.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, my current position is (4, 2). The goal 'G' is above me. To move closer to the goal, I should move upwards.

However, I need to check if moving straight up is possible. Looking at the maze, there's a wall immediately above my current position, blocking my direct path up.

Since moving directly up is not possible, I should look for an alternative route. The best move in this scenario is to move left to position (4, 1), hoping that from there I can find a path up or further left that eventually leads upwards towards the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move from (4, 2) would be to (4, 1), moving left.

Please update the maze accordingly for my next decision.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems I'm back to the starting position!

Considering the current state of the maze, my next move from (4, 1) would be to move up to position (3, 1).

However, there is a wall at (3, 1), blocking my direct path.

Given this, my best option is to move left to position (4, 0), hoping that from there, I can find a way up that eventually leads to the goal.

So, the coordinates of my next move from (4, 1) would be to (4, 0), moving left.

Please update the maze accordingly for my next decision.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze, my current position is (4, 0).

To get closer to the goal, I should try to move up. Let's check the position above me. Since there's no wall directly above my current position, I can move up to (3, 0).

So, the coordinates of my next move from (4, 0) would be to (3, 0), moving up.

Please update the maze accordingly for my next decision.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved up to (3, 0). Now I'm closer to the goal, but there are walls blocking my direct path.

Considering my current position, I notice that I can move left, but that won't get me closer to the goal. I can move right, but I'll hit a wall immediately.

The best option seems to be moving up to (2, 0). There's no wall directly above my current position, so I can make this move.

So, the coordinates of my next move from (3, 0) would be to (2, 0), moving up.

Please update the maze accordingly for my next decision.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved up to (2, 0).

Considering my current position, I can move left, but that doesn't seem to be the best option. I can try moving right, but there's a wall at (2, 1).

However, I notice that there's an opening at (2, 2), two spaces to my right. To get there, I'll need to move right twice, but first, I need to move right once to (2, 1) and then assess the situation again.

So, the coordinates of my next move from (2, 0) would be to (2, 1), moving right.

Please update the maze accordingly for my next decision.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag path" or a "serpentine path".

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zig-zag shape:


0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 0
0 1 1 0 G
0 P 0 1 0

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and has a zig-zag shape formed by its empty spaces. It's not an identical copy of the original maze, but it shares the same general shape.
