You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position (P) is at (4,1). The goal position (G) is at (3,4). 

The possible moves from the current position are up, left, right, or down. However, moving up is not possible due to the wall above. 

Considering the options, I would recommend moving to the right, as it provides more opportunities to explore the maze.

The coordinates of my next move would be (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4,2), I have several possible moves. I can move up, left, right, or down. Moving up would put me into a narrow path with limited options, so I'll avoid that for now. Moving left would take me back to the previous position. 

Considering the options, I would recommend moving to the right. The path to the right seems more open, which might lead to a solution.

The coordinates of my next move would be (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4,3), I can move up, left, right, or down. However, moving up is still limited by the wall above, and moving right is blocked by the wall as well. Moving left would take me back to the previous position, which I've already explored.

Considering the options, I would recommend moving down. Since there is no wall below, this might lead to a new path or a way to get closer to the goal.

However, as I am already at the bottom of the maze, I will instead move left. The coordinates of my next move would be (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems I've returned to a familiar position. Since I was here before, I know that moving right from this spot doesn't lead directly to a solution. 

This time, I would recommend moving left. I'll explore the left side of the maze to see if it leads to a better path.

The coordinates of my next move would be (4,1), then potentially (4,0) or even (3,0) if possible. However, the immediate coordinates of my next move would be (4,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to the left. Now, I'm at the position (4,1) or more left at position (4,0) where the 'P' symbol would be more accurately positioned and indeed it seems a little off, so let's adjust that.

So from (4,0), I can move up, which seems like the most promising option.

The coordinates of my next move would be (3,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (3,0). Since I want to get closer to the goal 'G' at position (3,4), I should try to move right. However, there is a wall to my immediate right.

I will move up instead, to explore potential paths above and around the wall.

The coordinates of my next move would be (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved up to position (2,0). Now I can try to move right, and see where it leads.

The coordinates of my next move would be (2,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) a serpentine or winding path with turns and straight sections, generally resembling a U-bend or a squashed "S" shape that spans from the lower left to the upper right.

For the new maze, I've generated the following:

0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 0 G
0 P 0 1 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar serpentine or winding path that connects the start (P) to the goal (G). The path is not identical to the original, but it retains the same general shape.
