You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'd be happy to help solve the maze.

The current player position is at (4,0) marked by 'P'. To reach the goal position 'G' at (3,4), my next move would be to move up to the empty space at (3,0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position. My next move is to coordinates (3,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I need to find a way around the walls to reach the goal position. My next move will be to move left to the empty space at (3,0) is not valid as I am already there so I will move left, so my move is to coordinates (3,-is not valid)  so my next valid move is to coordinates (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I've moved left to (2,0). To continue, I want to move up to the empty space at (1,0). My next move is to coordinates (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I've moved up to (1,0). Since I want to make progress towards the goal position 'G', I'll try to move right. However, there's a wall to my immediate right, so I'll move up to the empty space at (0,0) isn't a good idea, since it isn't closer to G. So I'll move right two spaces isn't valid, so I'll try to move up. The up position is (0,0) that means I should move right in the space after P so, my next move is to coordinates (1,1) isn't valid so my move is to (1,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "zigzag" or "winding path".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag shape:

0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

This new maze has a winding path that allows the player to move from P to G through empty spaces, while avoiding walls. The overall shape of the corridors is similar to the original maze, but the specific layout is different.
