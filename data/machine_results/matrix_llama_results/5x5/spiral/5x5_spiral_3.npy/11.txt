You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position (0, 3), marked by 'P'. My goal is to reach position (2, 3), marked by 'G'. To get closer to my goal, I will move to position (0, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are (0, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and provide it back to me.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again. I am currently at position (0, 2), marked by 'P'. My goal is still to reach position (2, 3), marked by 'G'.

Since I am at the top row and cannot move up, my next move will be to move down to position (1, 2). However, I see that there is a wall (1) at that position, so I will avoid it. 

I will move to position (0, 1).

The coordinates of my next move are (0, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and provide it back to me.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I am currently at position (0, 1), marked by 'P'. My goal is still to reach position (2, 3), marked by 'G'.

To make progress towards the goal, I will move left to position (0, 0).

The coordinates of my next move are (0, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and provide it back to me.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I am currently at position (0, 0), marked by 'P'. My goal is still to reach position (2, 3), marked by 'G'.

I've reached the leftmost column, and my only option is to move down. I will move down to position (1, 0).

The coordinates of my next move are (1, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and provide it back to me.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I am currently at position (1, 0), marked by 'P'. My goal is still to reach position (2, 3), marked by 'G'.

To get closer to the goal, I will move down to position (2, 0).

However, I see that after that move, I might not have a clear path to the goal due to the wall at (2, 1). So, my plan is to move down to (2, 0), and then reassess the situation to find a possible route to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and provide it back to me.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I am currently at position (2, 0), marked by 'P'. My goal is to reach position (2, 3), marked by 'G'.

Since the goal is to my right and there is an empty space at (2, 2), I can move right to that position to get closer to the goal.

However, I see that there is a wall at (2, 1) that blocks my direct path to (2, 2). So, my next move will be to move right to (2, 1) is not possible. I have to go around it.

I see that I can move down to (3, 0), then move right and try to find an alternative route to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and provide it back to me.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I am currently at position (3, 0), marked by 'P'. My goal is still to reach position (2, 3), marked by 'G'.

Now, I will move right to position (3, 1) but there is a wall at (3, 1) that blocks my direct path to the right. However I see there is an empty space at (3, 4) so I will move right to (3, 4), 

the only other alternative would be to go back up and make the original right move 

I prefer to keep going with the alternative route.

 However my next move will be (3, 4).

 the move I provide would then be (3, 4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(distorted) Inverted U shape".

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:


0 0 0 P 0
0 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 G


In this new maze, the empty spaces form an Inverted U shape, which is similar to the original maze but not an identical copy. The path from P to G can be reached through empty spaces, and the maze has the same size as the original.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
