You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Current player position (P) is at coordinates (0,3).
My goal is to navigate to the goal position (G) at coordinates (2,2).

My next move will be to move down to the empty space at coordinates (1,3). However, since there is a wall at that position, I will instead move right to the empty space at coordinates (0,4).

So, my next move is to (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,4), I can see that I have limited options.

My goal is to navigate to the goal position (G) at coordinates (2,2). Since I'm at the rightmost edge of the maze, I can only move down. I see that there is an empty space below me at coordinates (1,4). However, I also notice that there is a wall to the left of that position, which limits my future movement options. Still, I need to move down to make progress, so my next move will be to (1, is not possible, I see I can move down but to the left is blocked) but then move to the (1 is not an option, 4 is not in my path to G)... to the "would have been next"... (no)... I should move down but there is wall after that one more down which is 2 down to the same x so down again then diagonals are not a thing here I can continue go down then left.

Next should be to go down (1,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "cross" or an " intersecting rectangle" however is more close to  plus sign shape. Both the horizontal and vertical arms of the plus sign shape provide possible paths, with the intersection in the center. I'll choose plus sign.

Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same plus sign shape:


0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 P 1
1 0 1 0 1
0 0 G 0 0
0 1 0 0 0
