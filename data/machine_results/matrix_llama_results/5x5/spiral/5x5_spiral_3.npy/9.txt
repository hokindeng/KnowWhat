You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Current player position (P) is at coordinates (0,3).
My goal is to navigate to the goal position (G) at coordinates (2,2).

My next move will be to move down to the empty space at coordinates (1,3). However, since there is a wall at that position, I will instead move right to the empty space at coordinates (0,4).

So, my next move is to (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,4), I can see that I have limited options.

My goal is to navigate to the goal position (G) at coordinates (2,2). To achieve this, I'll try to move closer to the goal.

My next move will be to move down to the empty space at coordinates (1,4). However, since there is a wall at that position, I will instead try to find an alternative route. A possible move is to go left to the empty space at coordinates (0,3).

So, my next move is to (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at position (0,3).

I'll examine the maze again to find a way to progress. The goal position (G) is still at coordinates (2,2).

Since I couldn't move down before, I'll try to move left to the empty space at coordinates (0,2).

So, my next move is to (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,2), I'm getting closer to the left edge of the maze.

The goal position (G) is still at coordinates (2,2). To get closer to it, I need to move down. However, there is a wall at (1,2), so I'll have to find an alternative route.

Since the wall blocks my path, I'll try to move left to the empty space at coordinates (0,1).

So, my next move is to (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,1), I can see that I'm almost at the left edge of the maze.

The goal position (G) is still at coordinates (2,2). To get closer to it, I need to move down. However, there is a wall at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4), so I'll have to find an alternative route.

Since the wall blocks my entire row, I'll try to move left to the empty space at coordinates (0,0).

So, my next move is to (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,0), I can see that I'm at the very top left corner of the maze.

Unfortunately, this doesn't bring me much closer to the goal position (G) at coordinates (2,2). However, I notice that the entire bottom row of the maze is empty. To make progress, I can try to move down to the bottom row and then navigate to the goal from there.

My next move will be to move down to the empty space at coordinates (4,0).

However, I will move down as far as I can go until I hit the bottom and I will end up in the coordinates (4,0) after several steps.



But the next move will still be to move down to the coordinates (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1,0), I've moved down one step.

I can see that I have a clear path down to the bottom row. To continue, I'll move down again to the empty space at coordinates (2,0).

However, the position (2,0) is not a very safe position to be as it does have adjacent wall at (2,1) location, thus we would go down one more step.



So my next move will still be to move down to the coordinates (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2,0), I'm getting closer to the goal.

My goal is to reach the goal position (G) at coordinates (2,2) or more precisely, at (2,3)  location considering column values starting from (0) as global left and going right increment the numbers but as we generally count so this results (2,3) location for column in common.



Since the goal is to my right and there is no wall at position (2,1), then at (2,2), I can try to move right.

However the position (2,1) has a wall, we cannot move there.



So, my next move will be to move down to (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3,0), I need to navigate to the goal position (G) at coordinates (2,2).

To do this, I need to move up and then right. However, the position (2,1) has a wall, and I'm still below the goal.

I'll first move right to the empty space at coordinates (3,1) then up is not an option as the wall is there at (2,1), another case will be moving further right.



But moving right (from 3,0 to 3,1) at first will be the very first move.



So, my next move will be to move right to (3,1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "U-shape" or a "horseshoe shape". This is because the empty spaces form a curved path that connects the starting point (P) to the goal (G).

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape or horseshoe shape:


0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 P
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0


Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it has the same size and a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is still recognizable as a U-shape or horseshoe shape.
