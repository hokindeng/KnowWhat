You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 3) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (2, 2).

To start solving the maze, we can try moving to an adjacent empty space. Given the initial maze:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

My first move will be to the left of the current position, to the empty space at coordinates (0, 2).

So, my next move is to coordinates (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

I can move down to an empty space. However, the wall below the current position blocks the direct path. I will move to the leftmost empty space adjacent to the current position, which is at coordinates (0, 1), but since I am already at the left I will choose the leftmost which is not to the left but down is blocked. Then I will move left's adjacent down which is not available hence I choose  (0,0) till I get an opening to go down.

So, my next move is to coordinates (0, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a **horseshoe** or **U-shape**.

Here is a new maze with the same size, a valid path from P to G, and empty spaces forming a horseshoe shape:

0 1 1 0 P
0 1 0 0 1
0 0 0 G 1
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Note that this new maze is not identical to the original one, but it still has a horseshoe-shaped path that connects P to G through empty spaces.
