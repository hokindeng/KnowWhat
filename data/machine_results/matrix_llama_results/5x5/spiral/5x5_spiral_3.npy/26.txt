You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position (P) is at coordinates (0, 3).

Since my goal is to navigate to the goal position (G) while avoiding walls, I need to find the optimal path. Looking at the maze, I see that there's an open path to the right of P.

My next move will be to the right, to the empty space at coordinates (0, 4).

So, my next move is to (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I've moved to the right, I'm now at (0, 4). To navigate to the goal (G), I notice that there's no direct path in the current row. I'll need to move downwards.

Looking at the maze, I see that I can move down from my current position to an empty space at (1, 4). However, that's blocked by a wall (1).

Instead, I can move down from a different position. A viable move would be to move left to (0, 3) and then down. However, I'll focus on the downward movement for now.

I'll move down to the empty space that is below my previous left position. That would put me at (1, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "**U-shaped**" corridor.

Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5), with empty spaces that form the same U-shaped corridor:


0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

This new maze has the same size as the original, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces form a U-shaped corridor, which is similar to the original maze, but with some variations in the wall layout.
