You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 3).

Since my goal is to navigate to 'G' while avoiding walls, I will examine the possible moves from the current position. I can move up, down, left, or right into an empty space.

The top left corner is (0,0), and I'm at (0,3), so I'm in the first row. Moving up isn't an option, since there's no space above me.

Looking at the positions adjacent to me:
- Moving down would put me at (1,3), but that's a wall (1).
- Moving left would put me at (0,2), which is an empty space (0).
- Moving right would put me at (0,4), which is also an empty space (0).

Given these options, I can choose to move either left or right. Since moving left would potentially get me stuck, I'll choose to move right to have more options for my next move. My next move would be to (0,4), which is currently an empty space.

Coordinates of my next move: (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (0,4). Now I'll re-evaluate the maze to determine the next best move. 

From my current position at (0,4), I can move:
- Up: Not possible since I'm already in the top row.
- Down: (1,4) is a wall.
- Left: (0,3) is the space I just came from, but it's still a valid empty space.
- Right: Not possible since I'm at the right edge of the maze.

However, there's an alternative. I can move down to the row below the wall by finding an empty space. But that would require me to move left first.

For now, I'll choose to move left to (0,3) to create the opportunity to move down to the row with the goal 'G' in the future.

Coordinates of my next move: (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved back to (0,3). I'll now re-evaluate the maze to plan my next move. 

Since I was previously at (0,4), I know that moving right doesn't provide a useful path forward. Moving up isn't an option, and moving left into (0,2) is also not helpful.

However, moving down could be a viable option if I can get past the wall. Examining the row below, I notice that the wall only has a single gap at (2,2) for the entire row. But there is an empty space above that gap at (1,2) that isn't directly accessible from my current position.

Given that, my next move is to start moving left to try to reach a position where I can move down below the wall. 

Coordinates of my next move: (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (0,2). Now, I'm in a position to move down.

Examining the options below me:
- Down: (1,2) has a wall, but (2,2) has an empty space (0) that could provide a path forward. However, I can only move one step at a time.
- Moving down to (1,2) isn't directly helpful, but it's the only way to reach (2,2), so I'll do that.

Alternatively, I could try moving further left, but I think moving down will bring me closer to the goal.

Coordinates of my next move: (1,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or "L-path".

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:
0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and forms an L-shape with its empty spaces. Note that the path is not identical to the original maze, but it retains the same general shape.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
