You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 3).

Since my goal is to navigate to 'G' while avoiding walls, I will examine the possible moves from the current position. I can move up, down, left, or right into an empty space.

The adjacent spaces to the current position 'P' at (0, 3) are:

- Up: (0, 3) -> (0, 2), which is an empty space '0'
- Down: (0, 3) -> (0, 4), which is also an empty space '0'
- Left: (0, 3) -> (0, 2), which is an empty space '0'
- Right: (0, 3) -> (0, 4), which is also an empty space '0'

Since I can move either left or right, and both lead to an empty space, I will choose to move left to coordinate (0, 2). After this move, my new position would be (0, 2).

Please update the maze and present it to me again. 

move to: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (0, 2). The updated maze shows my new position.

Next, I need to examine the adjacent spaces again to find a path to 'G'.

- Up: Not possible, as I'm already at the top row.
- Down: (0, 2) -> (1, 2), which is a wall '1'. Not possible.
- Left: (0, 2) -> (0, 1), which is an empty space '0'. Possible move.
- Right: (0, 2) -> (0, 3), which is also an empty space '0'. Possible move, but I've already been there.

I'll choose to move left to (0, 1). 

Please update the maze.

move to: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (0, 1). 

Next, I'll examine the adjacent spaces to find a path to 'G'.

- Up: Not possible, as I'm already at the top row.
- Down: (0, 1) -> (1, 1), which is a wall '1'. Not possible.
- Left: Not possible, as I'm already at the leftmost column.
- Right: (0, 1) -> (0, 2), which is an empty space '0'. I've been there before, but I can move there again to explore other possibilities.

However, I notice that I've reached a dead end. I need to move back to (0, 2) and then explore moving down to find a way to 'G'. Since I know (1, 2) is a wall, I'll move right to (0, 2) and then try moving down again.

Please update the maze.

move to: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved back to (0, 2). 

Since I know moving up and left are not possible, I'll examine the right and down directions.

- Right: (0, 2) -> (0, 3), which is an empty space '0'. Possible move, but I've already been there, and it doesn't lead to 'G'.
- Down: (0, 2) -> (1, 2), which is a wall '1'. However, I notice that the space below the wall has a possible path. If I move down two spaces to (2, 2), I might be able to reach 'G'.

Unfortunately, I cannot move down two spaces directly, as there is a wall in the way. I need to move to a column that doesn't have a wall in the second row. 

Let's examine the adjacent columns to (0, 2).

- If I move left to (0, 1), I've already explored that path and it's a dead end.
- If I move right to (0, 3) or further, I'll be moving away from 'G'.

However, I see a possibility if I move even further to the left, to the first column, and then move down.

Since the first column has no wall in the second row adjacent to (0, 0), I can move down from there.

I will move left to (0, 1), left again to (0, 0), and then I can try moving down.

First, I'll move left to (0, 1).

move to: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (0, 1) again. This time, I'll continue moving left to reach the first column.

I will move left to (0, 0).

move to: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (0, 0). 

Now that I'm in the first column, I'll try to move down to explore a new path.

I will move down to (1, 0).

move to: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (1, 0). 

Now I'll try to move down again, as there's a possible path to 'G' from this column.

I will move down to (2, 0), then I can try moving right to reach 'G'.

move to: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (2, 0). 

Now, I'm close to 'G', and I see that I can move right to (2, 1) and then right again to reach 'G'. However, there's a wall at (2, 1), so I'll move right twice but starting from a different position.

I'll move right to (2, 2) but first, I need to move right to an empty space.

I'll move right to (2, 1) is not possible so I'll move right twice: to (2, 2) via (no possible move to 2,1), (2,3) and get the G on the third right


move to: (2,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a zigzag shape or more specifically an "S" shape, curved in a particular way.


Here is a new maze of the same size as the original, with empty spaces that form a recognizable S shape:


G 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
