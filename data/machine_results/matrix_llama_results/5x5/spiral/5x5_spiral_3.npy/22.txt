You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at coordinates (0,3). 

Considering the constraints of only moving through empty spaces (represented by '0') in the up, down, left, or right directions, my next move would be to move up is not possible because moving up would put me at (0,2) which is out of the maze, moving left is possible, and moving down is also not possible because there is a wall, and moving right will lead me further away from the goal.

So, the coordinates of my next move would be (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (0,2). Let's evaluate the options:

Moving up is possible, and it leads to an empty space at coordinates (0,1).
Moving left is also possible, but it would not lead me closer to the goal.
Moving down would put me at the wall, so it's not a viable option.
Moving right is possible and it would put me back at the previous position, which doesn't help.

Considering the goal position, my next move should aim to get closer to it while avoiding walls. Given the constraints, moving down isn't an option, but moving up doesn't contribute much to reaching the goal directly. However, I can prepare for future moves by clearing the way towards the only viable path that seems to lead to the goal.

Therefore, the most viable option seems to be moving left. However, since the goal seems to be at the third row, the optimal move to make would be the one that eventually brings me towards the goal.

My next move is to the left, which would put me at (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (0,1). I'll assess the options:

Moving up would lead me to the border of the maze and not towards the goal.
Moving down is now a viable option as there is an empty space below me that I can move into, getting closer to the third row where the goal is.
Moving left is not possible as I am at the leftmost column.
Moving right is possible, but it doesn't bring me closer to the goal.

My goal is to get closer to the goal at 'G'. To achieve that, I should move towards the row where the goal is located. Thus, moving down seems the most logical choice as it brings me closer to the row of the goal and positions me for further moves towards the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to go down to (1,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "H-shape" or more broadly, a shape resembling a "bent rectangle" or a shape that includes two distinct rectangles joined by a corridor.


Here's a new maze that meets the specified criteria, with empty spaces forming a similar shape:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 P
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 G
0 0 0 1 0

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and its corridors form a shape that can be recognized as an H-shape. It's not an identical copy of the original maze.
