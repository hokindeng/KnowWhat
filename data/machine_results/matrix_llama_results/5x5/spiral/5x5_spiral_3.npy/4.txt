You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position (0, 3), marked by 'P'. My goal is to reach position (2, 3), marked by 'G'. To get closer to my goal, I will move right one step to position (0, 4), which is an empty space.

The coordinates of my next move are (0, 4).

Please provide the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again. Since I am now at position (0, 4) and my goal is still at position (2, 3), I need to find a way to get closer to the goal.

To do this, I will move down one step to position (1, 4). However, this position is occupied by a wall (represented by '1'). Therefore, I need to find an alternative.

I will move left one step to position (0, 3), which is an empty space.

The coordinates of my next move are (0, 3).

Please provide the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems I'm back to the starting position!

With the maze in this state, I will analyze the situation again. Since I am at position (0, 3) and my goal is at position (2, 3), I need to find a way to move down.

However, the position directly below me, (1, 3), is occupied by a wall. I need to find an alternative route.

I will move left one step to position (0, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are (0, 2).

Please provide the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved one step to the left.

Now that I am at position (0, 2), my goal is still at position (2, 3). I will analyze the situation again.

To get closer to the goal, I will move down one step to position (1, 2). However, this position is occupied by a wall.

Let me look for an alternative. I can move left one step to position (0, 1).

The coordinates of my next move are (0, 1).

Please provide the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved one step to the left.

Now that I am at position (0, 1), my goal is still at position (2, 3). I will analyze the situation again.

Since I am at the leftmost edge of the maze, I can only move down or to the right. Moving right will lead me back to the starting point, which is not desirable.

I will move down one step to position (1, 1), but it's a wall, and then the next position down is also a wall (at position (2, 1) there is also a wall to the left, but at (3, 1) there is not), and further down there is an empty space, at position (4, 1) and (3, 1).

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 1).

However I don't believe this is going to be my shortest path, based on how far it is removed from the goal G that is my target to arrive at.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a rectangle with two narrow rectangles or bars that connect the left and right sides of the rectangle at the top and bottom, thus enclosing a large middle rectangular area that has no empty spaces. A common term to describe it is a "frame" shape with an enclosed rectangle, or as I name it, a " picture frame".


(2) Here is a new maze with the same size as the original (5x5), with empty spaces that form a recognizable "picture frame" shape:


P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 G 0


In this new maze, the path from P to G forms a similar "picture frame" shape, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces (corridors) allow for a valid path from the start position P to the goal position G.
