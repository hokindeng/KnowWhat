You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 3) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (2, 3).

My next move would be to go up, but since I'm already at the top row, I can only move left or right. To get closer to the goal, I should move left. 

So, my next move would be to (0, 2).

Please let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the current state of the maze, I'm at coordinates (0, 2).

To proceed, I'll go down to (1, 2), but since it's a wall (represented by '1'), that's not a valid move. 

Instead, I'll move down while also going left to avoid the wall. However, since the new x coordinate would be the same as the wall that's at (1,2), I will move left instead.

So, my next move would be to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (0, 1). 

Moving left would put me at (0, 0) which is an empty space. 

So, my next move would be to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (0, 0).

Since the goal is below me and I want to try to reach it, I will move down. 

So, my next move would be to (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (1, 0).

I will move down again to get closer to the goal.

However, since there's a wall below me at (2, 0) is next to a wall to my right at (2,1), and is also above my 'goal' destination, moving left at this point is not possible without immediately coming back to this point, and moving up is backtracking. Moving right is also not possible as the wall next to this path at (1,1) blocks my passage for now. 

So, my next move would be to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (2, 0).

I see that the goal 'G' is to my right and there's an empty space before it. 

So, my next move would be to (2, 1) but there is a wall there. Therefore, I must traverse the only available path and continue in a rightward direction, after that, and go to (2, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) a U-shape

The empty spaces form a U-shape, with the top left part of the maze being connected to the bottom part of the maze by a narrow corridor.

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0 G
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

This new maze meets the criteria:

* Same size as the original maze
* Includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
* Not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as a U-shape

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
