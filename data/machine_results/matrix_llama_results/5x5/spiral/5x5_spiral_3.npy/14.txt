You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since we're at the position marked 'P', we're at coordinates (0, 3). Our goal is to reach the position marked 'G' at coordinates (2, 3).

To move towards the goal, I would suggest moving down to the position below us, which is currently an empty space '0' at coordinates (1, 3). However, this is not possible since there's a wall '1' blocking our path.

Instead, let's move to the left of our current position to the empty space '0' at coordinates (0, 2). This move will help us avoid the wall and create a path to move down later.

Therefore, my next move would be to the coordinates (0, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I'm now at coordinates (0, 2).

My goal is to reach the position marked 'G' at coordinates (2, 3). To get closer to the goal, I would suggest moving down to the position below us. However, there's a wall '1' at coordinates (1, 2), so I need to find an alternative.

Let's move to the left of our current position to the empty space '0' at coordinates (0, 1). This move will help us avoid the wall and create a path to move down later.

However, I notice that I can also move to the left one more step to coordinates (0, 0), but that would take me away from the goal. Instead, I'd prefer to move down as soon as possible.

Considering the available options, I'd rather move to the left just one step, so my next move would be to the coordinates (0, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (0, 1). I notice that I'm still above the wall, and I want to move down towards the goal.

Since I'm in the second column, I'll try to find an opening in the wall below me. I see that the wall extends for a few columns, but I notice that there's an empty space '0' at coordinates (2, 1) that I can try to reach.

However, to get to that empty space, I need to move down past the wall, and the only way to do that is to move to the left or right until I find an opening. I notice that the wall is shorter on the left side, and I can move down sooner if I go that way.

So, my next move would be to move left to coordinates (0, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at coordinates (0, 0).

Since my goal is to reach the position marked 'G' at coordinates (2, 3), I need to find a way to move down towards it. As I'm currently at the top-left corner of the maze, I have to move down, but I need to avoid the wall below me.

To get past the wall, I notice that there's a longer path without walls on the right side of the maze, so my next move would be to move to the right towards those empty spaces.

My next move would be to the coordinates (0, 1).

However, I already moved from (0, 1) previously, and it didn't bring me much closer to the goal. To make progress, I'd rather move more significantly to the right. 

My next move would be to the coordinates (0, 4).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or an "L-path."

Here's a new maze with the same size (5x5) and an L-shaped path formed by the empty spaces:


0 1 1 1 0
0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 0


Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-shape.
