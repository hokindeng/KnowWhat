You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position (0,4).

My current position is (0,3) which is marked by 'P'. I can move to (0,4) as it is an empty space ('0') and adjacent to my current position.

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome of my move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will make my next move to the position (1,4), then I see it's a wall,  so instead I will move to position (0,3) as my next step backwards or I can go down, so I choose down: (1 doesn't work) so my new x is still 0, my new y is 1 so (1, nope, so I try) (0, no not going back - let me see it as y,4.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I moved back to the original position, I'll try moving down this time. My current position is (0,3) and I'll move down to (1,3). However, I see that (1,3) is a wall ('1'), so that's not possible. Instead, I'll try moving down to the next available empty space, which is not available in the 1 y coordinate (the wall stretches all the way across) my new y will be the one below the wall so I'll move down to y 3 nope (still blocked by wall) move down to y 4, nope, the x is the issue here, try 4: no not 4 as I may go out of bounds and nothing to the left as we already explored). How about (1 nope, as we've already decided that was a wall so) lets do y at 2 at x of 4 no still going to hit, lets try one x further, (still cannot get past the wall so here.)( 4,x 3.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "rectangle" or " frame" with a "pocket" or " niche" leading to the goal position (G).

However, one might argue that it resembles a " horseshoe" shape or the letter "U" more broadly since there is a central gap or valley enclosed by walls on three sides.


(2) Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5), with empty spaces that form a similar shape:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 0 0

In this new maze, the start and goal positions have been swapped, and the pocket or niche is located at the bottom instead of the middle row. The shape of the empty spaces still resembles a horseshoe or the letter "U".
