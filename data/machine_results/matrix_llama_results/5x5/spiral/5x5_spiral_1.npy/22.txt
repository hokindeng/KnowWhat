You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. 

I'm currently at position (0,4) marked 'P'. My goal is to reach position (2,1) marked 'G'.

My possible moves from (0,4) are up, down, left, or right. Since I'm already at the top row, moving up is not possible. Moving right is also not possible as it would take me out of the maze. 

I will move down to (1,4) as it's the only empty space adjacent to my current position. The coordinates of my next move are (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 P
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1,4), I have two possible moves: up or down. I've just come from the position above, so moving up would bring me back to the starting position. 

I'll move down to (2,4) and then reassess my surroundings to plan the next step towards reaching the goal 'G'. The coordinates of my next move are (2,4), but since the goal is to the left, I can also try moving to the left, however, there is a wall so for now the best move would be (2 doesn't work, 3 doesn't work) actually (3,4) is the best coordinate to try for now, I will check it as my next move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or an "L-path" with an additional horizontal path along the top.

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:


0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 1
0 G 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

In this new maze, the path from P to G follows the same L-shape, but with some variations in the wall placement to create a distinct maze. The new maze meets all the criteria, including having the same size, a valid path from P to G, and a recognizable L-shape formed by the empty spaces.
