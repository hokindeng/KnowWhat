You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the right, as there is an empty space adjacent to the current player position.

My current position is (0,4), and I will move to (0,5), but since the maze only has 5 columns, my next move will be invalid if I move to the right. However, the correct column index for the player position 'P' is 4. Therefore, I will correct the column index of 'P' to 4.

I will move to (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will move down to the next empty space. Since my current position is (0,3), I will move to (1,3). However, there is a wall at (1,3). Therefore, I need to find an alternative.

I will move down to (1,4) and then move to the right is not possible because my current column index is 3, not 4. Then, I will try to move down to (1,3), but that position has a wall. I can move down to no position in the second row because all positions have walls.

I will move up, but that is not possible because my current row index is 0.

Then I will try to move to the left. My current position is (0,3) and I can move to (0,2).

I will move to (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.My current position is (0,2). I will move down to the next empty space. 

However, I have a wall at position (1,2). Then, I will try to move left. My current position is (0,2) and I can move to (0,1).

I will move to (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.My current position is (0,1). I will move to the left. 

My current position is (0,1) and I can move to (0,0).

I will move to (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.My current position is (0,0). I can only move down or to the right.

Since my objective is to reach the goal 'G' at position (2,1), I will move down to get closer to it. However, I have a wall at (1,0) that prevents me from moving straight down.

I will move to the right, as that is the only available option to make progress.

I will move to (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.My current position is (0,1). I have already visited this position before, but now I need to try the down direction again. I will move down to (1,1), but there is a wall.

However, I can try to move down at a different column index. There is a wall at column indices 0, 1, 2, and 3 of row index 1, so I will try column index 4 of row index 1.

My next available move down is at position (1,4), as there is an empty space at this position.

I will move to (1,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a type of horseshoe or inverted U-shape. 

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same shape:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
