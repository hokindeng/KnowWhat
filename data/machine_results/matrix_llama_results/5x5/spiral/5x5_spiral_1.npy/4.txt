You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. 

I'm currently at position P, which is (0,4). My goal is to reach position G, which is (2,1).

Since I can only move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent empty space, my next move should be to position (0,3), which is an empty space. 

So, the coordinates of my next move are (0,3).

Please update the maze with my new position and let me know the updated maze, and I'll plan the next move accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,3). Since my goal is to reach position G, which is (2,1), I'll plan the next move.

Looking at the maze, I see that I can move down to position (1,3), but it's blocked by a wall. I can also move up, but that would take me further away from the goal. 

I can move left to position (0,2), which is an empty space. That would get me closer to the left side of the maze and eventually allow me to move down towards the goal.

So, the coordinates of my next move are (0,2).

Please update the maze with my new position and let me know the updated maze, and I'll plan the next move accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,2). I'll examine the maze to plan the next move.

Looking at the maze, I can see that I can move left to position (0,1) or move left to position (0,0), both of which are empty spaces. But, I can also see that position (0,1) and position (0,0) don't provide any advantage over my current position in terms of reaching the goal, G, more directly. However, I can move left to position (0,1) and after that move down.

However I can move left to (0,1). Then my next move after that would put me at position (1,1). This brings me closer to the goal in a more direct route as my next available moves are more directed towards the goal than if I had gone to position (0,0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or an "L-path", as it resembles the shape of the letter L. This L-shape is formed by the empty spaces that connect the current player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:


0 P 1 0 0
1 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0


In this new maze, the L-shape is still recognizable, but the maze is not an identical copy of the original. The empty spaces form a path from P to G that can be reached by moving through adjacent empty spaces.
