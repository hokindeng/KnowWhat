You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 4) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (2, 1).

To start solving the maze, we can move the player to an adjacent empty space. One possible move from the current position (0, 4) is to move down to coordinates (1, 4), but since there's a wall ('1') at coordinates (1, 0-3), it's better to move left to coordinates (0, 3) which is an empty space ('0').

So, the coordinates of my next move are (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), I can see that moving down to (1, 3) would put me into a wall. I can also see that moving left to (0, 2) is a valid move, as it's an empty space.

So, the coordinates of my next move are (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), I can move left to (0, 1) which is another empty space.

So, the coordinates of my next move are (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), I can see that moving down to (1, 1) is not possible because there's a wall. I can also see that moving left to (0, 0) is a valid move, as it's an empty space.

So, the coordinates of my next move are (0, 0) but then I would be moving away from the goal (G), I can also move right to the original position which isn't desirable. Alternatively I can move down and right which appears to have a path forward, although it has a wall that would need to be avoided.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at the leftmost edge of the maze (0, 0), I'll move down to the next row. I'll avoid the wall at (1, 0-3) by moving to an empty space at (1 is not possible due to wall), (actually moving to second row would have one going into a wall), a location 2 down would put one at (2,0) right next to the goal.

So, the coordinates of my next move are (2, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a " horseshoe" or more specifically a "u-shape".

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same horseshoe or u-shape:
```
0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 1
0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0
```
This new maze has a valid path from P to G, and its empty spaces form a similar horseshoe or u-shape as the original maze. Note that the walls are placed differently, making it a distinct maze from the original.
