You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 4) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (2, 1).

To start solving the maze, we can move the player to an adjacent empty space. One possible move from the current position (0, 4) is to move left to (0, 3), which is an empty space.

My next move is to (0, 3).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), we can try to move down to (1, 3), but that's a wall. So, we need to move in a different direction.

We can move the player down is not possible, so let's move it left to (0, 2), which is an empty space.

My next move is to (0, 2).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), we can move the player left to (0, 1), or we can move down, but there is a wall directly below us, so we cannot move down.

One possible move from the current position (0, 2) is to move left to (0, 1), which is an empty space.

My next move is to (0, 1).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), we can see that we are close to the goal, but there are walls blocking our path.

To move closer to the goal, we can move down, but as mentioned there are walls directly below us. However, there is a possibility of accessing the goal if we can go down a bit further to the right, thus avoiding the wall.

One possible move from the current position (0, 1) is to move right to (0, 2), which is an empty space that might allow us to move closer to the goal.

My next move is to (0, 2).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back to this position.

From the current position (0, 2), we can't move down directly. However, we can try to move further right to (0, 3) and then see if we can move down to get closer to the goal.

My next move is to (0, 3).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), we still can't move down directly due to the wall.

However, we can try to move right to (0, 4), and then see if we can move down and find a way to get closer to the goal.

My next move is to (0, 4).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back to the starting position.

Let's try a different approach. From the current position (0, 4), we can move down to (1, 4), which is an empty space.

My next move is to (1, 4).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 P
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 4), we can try to move down to (2, 4), which is an empty space.

However, I notice that there's a wall to the left of the goal. So, we'll need to find a way to move around it to reach the goal.

My next move is to (2, 4).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 P
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 4), we can see that we're close to the goal.

One possible move is to move left to (2, 3). However, there's a wall at that position, so we can't move there.

Another possible move is to move left to (2, 2), but there's also a wall in that direction.

However, we can move left to (2, 1) or (2,0) the left area by the goal,  by one or two places getting closer or even landing adjacent to the goal (G).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "U-shape" or a "horseshoe shape". The empty spaces form a curved path that connects the starting point (P) to the goal (G), with walls on either side of the path.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:
```
0 0 0 0 P
1 0 1 1 0
0 0 G 1 0
1 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```
This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is also a U-shape or horseshoe shape, similar to the original maze. However, the new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, with different wall placements and a distinct path to the goal.
