You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 4) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (2, 1).

To start solving the maze, we can move the player to an adjacent empty space. One possible move from the current position (0, 4) is to move left to (0, 3), which is an empty space.

My next move is to (0, 3).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), I can see that moving down to (1, 3) would hit a wall (represented by '1'). Moving right to (0, 4) would bring us back to the starting position. Moving up to (0, 2) or (0, 1) or (0, 0) are all valid options, but moving to (0, 2) seems to be a good next step since it moves closer to the goal position.

My next move is to (0, 2).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), moving down to (1, 2) is not an option as it would hit a wall (represented by '1'). However, moving down and a bit to the right, specifically to the position below the current one at (1, is not possible, but  we do have the option to move to (0,1).

My next move is to (0,1).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), we are next to the left edge of the maze. Our only possible moves are to the right (back to the previous position), or down. Moving right would undo our last move, so let's move down to (1,1), although it is blocked by a wall (represented by '1'), moving to that spot isn't an option. We'll need to find another way around the wall. We'll try moving right first in an attempt to find a way to move down further (we were at (0,2) 2 turns ago).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back at (0, 2). This time, let's try moving right to (0, 3) and then down to find a way around the wall. Since we've already moved right from this spot before, we know that it's a valid move.

My next move is to (0, 3).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), I can try moving down to (1, 3) but this is blocked by a wall (represented by '1'), however I can move right (back to a space I previously occupied), or move left. Let's try moving left into (0,2), I already know this is a valid space. However I have been there before, and last time, I didn't make progress from that spot.

Since I moved left would not be making progress, I should try to explore down further (although I cannot go down at my current location). However I can attempt to move right twice in hopes that the space below that spot will be available. So my next move is the first step in that plan to (0,4).

My next move is to (0,4).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (0, 4). From this position, I can try moving down to (1, 4). This spot was not previously blocked by a wall (represented by '1'), when I last was in a position to see it, so it seems like a good space to try to move to.

My next move is to (1, 4).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 P
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (1, 4). Now that I'm in this position, I can see the space to my left is a wall (represented by '1') so I won't be moving left. The spaces above me are empty, but moving up would be undoing my prior moves. I should keep exploring this new row for potential paths. However to my right is out of bounds of the maze and to my left is a wall. I have one option I haven't yet explored and that is moving down to (2,4).

My next move is to (2, 4).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 P
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (2, 4). From this position, I can see that moving left would bring me into contact with a wall (represented by '1'), I've also already explored moving up, so my remaining options are to move down or to explore other parts of the current row. I can see that moving down to (3, 4) will also bring me into contact with a wall. The remaining unexplored option on this row is (2, 3), but that also has a wall. However there are two unexplored spots on this row (2,1) and (2,2) one of which contains the goal (G).

My next move is to (2, 2).

However I am next to the goal, and in order to explore both unexplored spots I will first move into (2,2) if it is not the goal I will move to (2,1) next.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "U-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, but with a different configuration of walls and empty spaces, while maintaining the U-shape:

0 0 0 0 P
1 0 1 1 0
0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a U-shape, but the location of the walls and the path from P to G are different from the original maze.
