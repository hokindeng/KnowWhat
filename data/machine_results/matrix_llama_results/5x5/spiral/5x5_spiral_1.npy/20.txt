You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 4) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (2, 1).

To start solving the maze, we can move the player to an adjacent empty space. One possible move from the current position (0, 4) is to move down to coordinates (1, 4), but since there's a wall ('1') at coordinates (1, 3), it would be better to move left.

My next move will be to coordinates (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, my next move will be to coordinates (0, 2). This moves the player left and gets closer to a possible path to the goal position.

My next move will be to coordinates (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved to coordinates (0, 2), my next move will be to coordinates (0, 1). This move will position the player closer to a potential path to the goal and will also give us a better view of the surrounding area.

My next move will be to coordinates (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, my next move will be to coordinates (0, 0). This is the only possible move from the current position, and it will allow us to potentially move down towards the goal position.

My next move will be to coordinates (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved to coordinates (0, 0), my next move will be to move down to coordinates (1, 0). However, since there's a wall ('1') at that position, I need to find an alternative.

Instead, I will move down to a valid position by going to coordinates ( no, there isn't a valid one immediately below). I need to find another route.

In this case, I will move right to coordinates (0 is where the 0 after the P is which is 0 but the row is 0 and the column will be one more so it is...  (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved back to coordinates (0, 1). To make progress, I will move down, but since the wall is in the way, I will move right again. 

My next move will be to coordinates (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved to coordinates (0, 2), I'll move right again to create more options for finding a path to the goal. 

My next move will be to coordinates (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to coordinates (0, 3). Now that I've reached the end of this row, I can move down to coordinates (1 is blocked,  so let's try (no isn't going to cut it here lets)... actually none of those. the first place that left can go is 3 because is starts at 0 

Move right doesn't work so my next move will be to move right and right is 4 so my move will be 0 and that last one will be 4.

My next move will be to coordinates (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved to coordinates (0, 4), I need to find a way down. I can try moving down to the next row, but I need to avoid the wall. 

Looking at the maze, I can see that the wall ends at column 4, so if I move down to the next row, I can move to coordinates (1, 4).

My next move will be to coordinates (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 P
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to coordinates (1, 4). Now I can see that I need to keep moving down to make progress. 

Since there is no wall below me, my next move will be to coordinates (2 is no good but then 3 has a wall under it 4 maintains an empty space under P while), going down one so 1 plus 1 is 2 so my row coordinate will be 2) 

My next move will be to coordinates (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 P
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved to coordinates (2, 4), I can see that the goal is within reach. However, I need to move left to get to it. 

Since there is a wall to the left at column 3, I need to move left one more space, beyond the wall, to get closer to the goal.

My next move will be to coordinates (2, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "U-shape" or a "horseshoe shape".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


0 0 0 0 P
1 0 1 1 0
0 0 G 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar U-shape or horseshoe shape, and there is a valid path from P to G that can be reached through the empty spaces. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, and it has the same size as the original maze.
