You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 4) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (2, 1).

To start solving the maze, the best next move from the current position 'P' would be to go down to the empty space at coordinates (1, 4), but that would put us in a position where we are surrounded by walls and cannot move further towards the goal. Instead, we need to find a path that allows us to move closer to the goal without getting trapped.

Considering the maze layout, a viable next move would be to go left from 'P' to the empty space at coordinates (0, 3). This keeps our options open for the subsequent moves.

Therefore, my next move will be to coordinates (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, the current player position 'P' is now at coordinates (0, 3). The next step should aim at finding a path towards the goal without getting blocked by walls.

The most direct approach is to try to move down towards the goal, but the wall directly below the current position prevents us from moving straight down. Therefore, we should try to find a way around the wall. Given the current layout, moving left seems to be the most promising option, as it could potentially allow us to go around the wall blocking our direct path to the goal.

My next move will be to coordinates (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, the current player position 'P' is now at coordinates (0, 2).

Considering our goal to reach the position marked 'G', and noticing that there's a clear path down if we move a bit further left, the best next move seems to be to keep going left. This would position us at the edge of the maze, and from there, we can move down, which gets us closer to the goal.

My next move will be to coordinates (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, the current player position 'P' is now at coordinates (0, 1).

Now, we are in a position where we can start moving downwards to get closer to the goal 'G'. Looking at the maze, if we move down from the current position, we end up right next to the goal.

My next move will be to coordinates (1, 1), but that is not possible since it is a wall. Instead, my next move will be to coordinates (2, 1) is also not directly possible from the current position. However, I can move down to (1 is not an option), (2 is not an option) ... wait  to (no) so down on the 0 column to y 2 is an empty space then goto the 1 col on the 2 row move to coordinates (2,1) indirectly to avoid the walls by going to (1, 0), no since that too is a wall  or go down to 2,0 then go  to 2,1.



My next move will be to coordinates (2, 0) is on "0" path

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape".


Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 G 0 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces also form a "U-shape" or "horseshoe shape". The maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze.
