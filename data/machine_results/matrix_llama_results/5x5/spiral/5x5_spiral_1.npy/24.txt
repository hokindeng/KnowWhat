You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 4) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (2, 1).

To start solving the maze, the first move should be to an adjacent empty space that brings us closer to the goal or at least does not move us further away. Since the only viable direction from the starting position is left, my next move would be to the left, to coordinates (0, 3).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), my next goal is to move closer to the goal 'G' located at (2, 1). Since moving down would put me into a wall, my best option is to continue moving left, aiming to eventually move down when it's feasible.

Therefore, my next move will be to the left again, to coordinates (0, 2).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting closer! From the current position (0, 2), I still aim to reach the goal 'G' at (2, 1). Since moving directly down is still blocked by walls, I will continue to move left to create an opportunity to move down later.

My next move will be to the left, to coordinates (0, 1).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've reached the leftmost column. Now, it's time to start moving down to get closer to the goal. Since the wall below me is only one cell high, I can move down and then reassess my situation.

My next move will be down, to coordinates (1, 1), but since that is blocked by a wall, I actually move to no new position but in the next move after this one I can move down to (2, 1), so right now my next move is not truly down but in following move is. However since you require a new position now, I will move nowhere but I will just move my player down in the following step.

However for this step I will make an exploratory non-move and say coordinates (0, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "U-shape" or a "horseshoe shape". The empty spaces form a path that starts from the top, moves down, and then curves back up to the goal position.

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar U-shape or horseshoe shape:


0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
0 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
0 P 0 0 0


This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a U-shape or horseshoe shape.
