You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. 

I see that the current player position is at coordinates (0,4), marked with 'P'. The goal is at coordinates (2,1), marked with 'G'. 

Considering the possible moves (up, down, left, or right) from the current position, I notice that moving up would lead to a wall, and moving right would also lead to a wall. However, moving left or down would be viable options, as there are empty spaces adjacent to the current position in those directions.

For the next move, I would like to move left from the current position (0,4) to the adjacent empty space at coordinates (0,3). 

Next move: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (0,3). Now I'll evaluate the new situation.

I can move up, but it would lead to the top edge of the maze, which isn't a problem, or I can move down or left. Moving right would put me back where I started, which isn't desirable.

I think moving down would be a good choice, as it brings me closer to the goal (G). 

Next move: (1,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "hourglass" or " dumbbell" shape, with the player position (P) at one end, the goal (G) at the other end, and a narrow connection or "neck" in the middle.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same hourglass shape:


0 0 P 1 0
1 0 1 0 1
0 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces also form an hourglass shape, with the player position (P) and the goal (G) at opposite ends, connected by a narrow corridor.
