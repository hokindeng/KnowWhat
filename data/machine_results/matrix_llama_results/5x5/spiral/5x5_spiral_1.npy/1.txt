You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 4) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (2, 1).

To start solving the maze, the best initial move would be to move left from the current position to empty space, which would put us at coordinates (0, 3).

The coordinates of my next move are (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), the next optimal move would be to move left again to an empty space, which would put us at coordinates (0, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), we can continue moving left to an empty space. The next optimal move would be to coordinates (0, 1).

However, considering the overall structure of the maze, our goal is to eventually move down towards the goal 'G'. But given the wall below our current position, we need to find a suitable opening. Moving left one more step will allow us to move down in the subsequent steps.

The coordinates of my next move are indeed (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we've moved left to (0, 1), we're in a good position to start moving down. However, there's a wall directly below us, so we need to find an alternative route.

Since there's an empty space to our left at (0, 0) and we can move down from there, our next move should be to (0, 0).

The coordinates of my next move are (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From our current position (0, 0), we can start moving down. Since the goal is to eventually reach (2, 1), where 'G' is, our next move should be downwards to (1, 0). However, there's a wall at (1, 0), so we need to look for an alternative.

The first available spot to move down is at (1, 4), but since we're at (0, 0), a better approach would be to move down when we're aligned with the empty space below the wall. Let's move to the right to align with the empty space below the wall.

The coordinates of my next move are (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're back at (0, 1), our next move should be to move right and try to get closer to the empty space below the wall. However, considering the overall structure of the maze, a more efficient approach would be to move right to (0, 4), then move down.

Let's move right to (0, 4). However, we can move down from the (0, 4) position's adjacent spot, at (0,3),  (0, 2), or  0 (0,1) or even try moving to (0,4), However moving to (0,4) is optimal in order to move down

Alternatively, we could also think of the following: We were previously at (0,0) already (although we currently are not), We could start going down if the wall was not present  If we make our x-coordinate equal to 4 we are then in a potential position to move down.

The coordinates of my next move are (0, 4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "U-shape" or a "horseshoe shape". This is because the empty spaces form a curved path that connects the starting point 'P' to the goal 'G'.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape or horseshoe shape:


0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
0 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
0 P 0 0 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar U-shape or horseshoe shape, and there is a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through the empty spaces. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it shares the same general shape and structure.
