You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 4) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (2, 1).

To start solving the maze, the best next move from the current position 'P' would be to go down to the empty space. Thus, the coordinates of my next move are (1, 4).

Please update the maze with my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 P
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, my next move from the current position 'P' at (1, 4) would be to go down to the empty space. Thus, the coordinates of my next move are (2, 4).

However, I notice that moving down directly might not lead directly to the goal 'G', and I might need to backtrack or take a longer route. A more strategic move could be to move left and try to find a path towards 'G' through that side.

Considering this, an alternative move could be to go left to the empty space, which would put me at coordinates (1, 3). But this would put me in front of a wall.

A better option would be to move further left, but since I can only move to adjacent spaces, I have to first move to (1, 3) and then reassess my options. However, as mentioned earlier, moving left directly isn't possible due to the wall.

Let's stick with the initial plan and move down, hoping to find a way through. The coordinates of my next move remain (2, 4).

Please update the maze with my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 P
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2, 4), my next move would be to go left to try to reach the goal 'G'. I can move left to the empty space at coordinates (2, 3). However, I see that there's a wall at (2, 3), so I'll need to move further left.

Let me move to the empty space at coordinates (2, 2). This puts me closer to the goal 'G' and might allow me to move towards it.

Please update the maze with my new position.

My next move is to coordinates (2, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "cross" or an " intersecting horizontal and vertical corridor".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 G 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar intersecting horizontal and vertical corridor, allowing for a valid path from P to G. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it shares the same general shape formed by its empty spaces.
