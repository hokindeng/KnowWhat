You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is represented by 'P', which is at coordinates (0, 4). The goal position is represented by 'G', which is at coordinates (2, 1).

Since my current position is at the top row, I can only move left, right, or down. Moving left would lead me to an empty space, but it would not bring me closer to the goal. Moving right is not possible because I am already at the rightmost column. Therefore, I will move down to the next row, which has empty spaces and will bring me closer to the goal.

My next move will be to coordinates (1, 4), which is the empty space directly below my current position.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 P
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and decide on the next move.

My current position is at coordinates (1, 4), and the goal position is still at coordinates (2, 1). Since my current position is at the second row, I can move left, right, up, or down. Moving right is not possible because I am already at the rightmost column. Moving up would lead me back to the starting position, which is not desirable. Moving down would put me into a wall, so that's not an option either.

Therefore, I will move left to the next empty space. My next move will be to coordinates (1, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "U-shape".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 1
0 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

This new maze has the same size as the original, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is also a U-shape, although it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
