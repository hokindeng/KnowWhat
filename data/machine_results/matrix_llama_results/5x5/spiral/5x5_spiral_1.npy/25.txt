You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 4) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (2, 1).

To start solving the maze, we can move the player to an adjacent empty space. One possible move from the current position (0, 4) is to move left to (0, 3), which is an empty space.

My next move is to (0, 3).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), I can see that moving down to (1, 3) would hit a wall (represented by '1'). However, I can move up is not an option since it would take me out of the maze boundaries, or I can move right back to the original position or move left to (0, 2) which is an empty space.

My next move is to (0, 2).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), I can move left to (0, 1) or move down, but moving down to (1, 2) would hit a wall. Since moving left would be the most logical next step, I will choose to move left.

However, I can also see that the goal position 'G' is getting closer and is located below my current position at (2, 1). To reach the goal position, I should eventually try to move down.

My next move is to (0, 1).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), I can move left to (0, 0) which is a valid move, or try to move down to reach the goal position 'G'. Since moving down to (1, 1) would hit a wall, I will have to move left for now and find an alternative route to move down later.

However, I notice that moving left would not bring me closer to the goal position. I should focus on finding a way to move down.

Let me re-evaluate the maze... Ah-ha! I can see that moving down is not possible from my current position, but I can try to move right and then move down.

My next move is to (0, 2).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.



Wait, I made a mistake! Since I already moved from (0, 2) to (0, 1), I can try to move left to (0, 0) and see if I can find an alternative path from there.

My next move is to (0, 0).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at the leftmost edge of the maze at (0, 0), my only viable option is to move right to (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), or (0, 4). However, I've already visited those positions, and moving to any of those coordinates would not bring me closer to the goal position 'G'.

Since I'm stuck at the top row, I need to think about how to move down to the row where the goal position 'G' is located. I can see that there's a wall blocking my way down from the top row, but I can try to move right and see if I can find a gap in the wall.

My next move is to (0, 4).

Please let me know if this move is correct and provide the updated maze.



After re-evaluating the maze, I realized that moving to (0, 4) might not be the best option. Since I've already visited that position, I should focus on finding a way to move down.

Wait, I can see a possible path! If I move to (0, 4) and then down is not an option, perhaps I can try to move to the last column and then try to find a way to move down.

However, I should re-evaluate the maze again and try to find a shorter path.

My next move is to move right to (0, 4) is a correct move in a way that I'll be in the rightmost position of the top row to try to move down in my subsequent moves (from the last column)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "U-shape" or a " Rectangular U-shape".


Here's a new maze with the same size and shape:


0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a "U-shape" or a "Rectangular U-shape", and there is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original maze.
