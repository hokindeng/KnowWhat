You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (0, 4) and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (2, 1).

To start solving the maze, the best initial move would be to move left from the current position to open up more possibilities for future moves.

Therefore, my next move is to move left from (0, 4) to (0, 3).

New coordinates: (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the current state of the maze, my next move would be to move left again from (0, 3) to (0, 2).

This move will get me closer to the top left corner of the maze and open up potential paths to move down towards the goal.

New coordinates: (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved to (0, 2), I need to start moving down towards the goal 'G' at (2, 1).

My next move will be to move down from (0, 2) to (1, 2). However, I notice that this space is occupied by a wall ('1'). So, I will instead move down from (0, 2) to a space that is not blocked by a wall, which is not currently available. 

Instead, I will move left from (0, 2) to (0, 1), trying to find a free path to move down towards the goal.

New coordinates: (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the current state of the maze, I've reached the top left part of the maze.

Since I want to get closer to the goal 'G' at (2, 1), my next move will be to move down from (0, 1) to a space that is free from walls and closer to the goal.

However, moving directly down is not possible due to the wall at (1, 1). Therefore, I will move down and a bit further right in a later step. For now, I will just move down and left is also blocked, so right is my only option.

New coordinates: Not available, however my next move is to move down from (0, 1) is not valid, I will move right, from (0, 1) to (0, 2).

New coordinates: (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved back to (0, 2), I will try to find an alternative path.

Since the goal 'G' is below me, I need to find a way to move down. However, moving directly down is still not possible due to the wall at (1, 2).

I notice that the space at (0, 0) is empty, and I can try to move left to that space. From there, I can reassess the situation.

My next move is to move left from (0, 2) to (0, 1), then to (0, 0).

New coordinates: (0, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "U-shape" or a "horseshoe shape".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 P
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 G 1 0
0 0 0 0 0


In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar U-shape or horseshoe shape, and there is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape and structure.
