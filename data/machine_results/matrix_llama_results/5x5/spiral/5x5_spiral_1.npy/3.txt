You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (0,4). To reach the goal G, I need to move down. My next move will be to the position (1,4). However, since there is a wall (1) at position (1,4) is not possible, I will move down to the position (1 is not possible, so I move to the adjacent space on the left) with coordinates (0,3) which has a '0' indicating an empty space. 

My next move is to position (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

Since I am now at position (0,3) marked as 'P', my goal is still to reach position 'G'. To do that, I need to move down. The position directly below me is a wall (1 1 1 1), but there is an empty space to the right of the wall. However, I'll move down and to the left of the wall to get closer to 'G' in the fewest number of steps. My next move will be to the position (1,3) but since it is a '1', I move to (1 is not possible, I move down one) with coordinates (1 is a wall, move down one space, left 2 from original P label above me) the space with coordinates (2 is one left of 'G', 'G' being at space (2,1), so at (2,0) Wall is at (2,0), move 1 right) the space right above 'G' that is empty and below the vertical three '1' wall with coordinates (2 is a wall at (2,0), Move one space to right.) With a coordinate of (2, 2 is one space closer than column 3 coordinate but a 1 is at that spot) Right above G and has open space to left of 'G' at '0 G 0', is two one spaces  right up Of, open available at G.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a zigzag-like or irregular, However, it is surrounded by straight corridor-like lines.
