You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since we're at the position 'P', which is at (0,4), our goal is to reach 'G' at (2,1).

To get to the goal, we need to move down and then left. Since moving down directly from the current position will put us into a wall, we'll move left first to create space for our next moves.

The next move will be to the left. The coordinates of our next move will be (0,3).

So, the answer is: (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We've moved to (0,3) successfully.

Now, we'll move down to (1,3). However, since there is a wall at (1,3), we can't move directly down. We need to find an alternative path.

Let's move down when we can, but for now, let's try moving left again to see if we can find a path. 

The coordinates of our next move will be (0,2).

So, the answer is: (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We've moved to (0,2) successfully.

Now, we'll move down to (1,2). Unfortunately, there is still a wall at (1,2). We can't move directly down yet. However, we can move left again to (0,1) to find a path.

The coordinates of our next move will be (0,1).

So, the answer is: (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We've moved to (0,1) successfully.

Now that we've moved as far left as we can, our next move will be down. Since we can't move directly down to (1,1) because of the wall, we'll wait for a chance to move down. Instead, we'll move left is not an option, so we move right.

However, moving right will undo our previous efforts. We'll wait for a chance to move down, but first let's reassess the situation.

We're at (0,1) and the goal is at (2,1). We can move down at (1,0) or (1,4), so let's try moving to (0,0) to move down.

However, moving to (0,0) won't help. We'll move right to the position that is on top of the wall of 1s, at (0,4). Then, we'll move down.

The coordinates of our next move will be (0,2), and the next move after will be to the far right and we'll take it from there.

So, the answer is: (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We've moved back to (0,2) successfully.

Since we can't move down directly due to the wall of 1s, our strategy is to move to the right, above the wall of 1s. Let's move right to (0,4) to create space to move down.

However, this position was already reached and led us back here. We can move to (0,3), move down, and then move left twice, moving around the square made by the 1s.

Our next move is the first move in this 4-move maneuver: moving to (0,3), right of our current position.

The coordinates of our next move will be (0,3).

So, the answer is: (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We've moved to (0,3) successfully.

As part of our 4-move maneuver to get past the wall of 1s, we'll now move down. The wall of 1s only extends 2 spaces down from the top, so we can move down at (0,3) and still avoid it.

Our next move will be to (1,3), directly below our current position.

However, the wall of 1s is also at this location so that will not work.

Instead we move to the furthermost right position and go down from there and move back left to the goal once past the wall.

We'll move right to (0,4).

So, the answer is: (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We've moved to (0,4) successfully.

Now we'll move down to get past the wall. Our next move will be to (1,4), directly below our current position.

The coordinates of our next move will be (1,4).

So, the answer is: (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 P
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We've moved to (1,4) successfully.

Now, we'll move left to get closer to the goal 'G'. Our next move will be to (1,3), directly left of our current position.

The coordinates of our next move will be (1,3).

However since the wall of 1s also extends to this position, this is also not possible.

Instead we move down one position, and move left from there.

Our next move is to move down. We move to (2,4).

So, the answer is: (2,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 P
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We've moved to (2,4) successfully.

Now we're on the same row as the goal 'G', but we're on the opposite side of the wall of 1s. Our strategy is to move left until we reach the goal.

Our next move will be to (2,3), directly left of our current position.

The coordinates of our next move will be (2,3).

So, the answer is: (2,3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape", since it has two vertical paths connected by a horizontal path at the bottom.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:
 
0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1
0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original, and forms a recognizable U-shape with its empty spaces.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
