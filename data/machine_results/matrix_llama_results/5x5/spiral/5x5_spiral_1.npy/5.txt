You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at coordinates (0,4) and the goal position is at coordinates (2,1). 

Since we can move up, down, left, or right to adjacent empty spaces, our next move should be to get closer to the goal position. 

Considering the given maze, the best next move would be to move left from the current position (0,4) to coordinates (0,3). This is because it will put us in a position to potentially navigate around the walls.

So, the coordinates of my next move would be (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, our current position is now (0,3). We still need to find a path to reach the goal position (2,1).

Since we're trying to get closer to the goal, the most reasonable next move would be to move down from our current position (0,3) to coordinates (1,3). However, there is a wall at (1,3), which is not a valid move.

Instead, we can try to move up from (0,3), but that wouldn't bring us any closer to the goal.

We can also move left from (0,3) to (0,2). This move doesn't immediately block our path to the goal and allows us to move closer to the left side, which might help us find a path later.

So, the coordinates of my next move would be (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, our current position is now (0,2). We still need to find a path to reach the goal position (2,1).

Since we're trying to get closer to the goal, the most reasonable next move would be to move down from our current position (0,2) to coordinates (1,2). However, there is a wall at (1,2), which is not a valid move.

We can try to move up from (0,2), but that wouldn't bring us any closer to the goal.

We can also move left from (0,2) to (0,1). This move doesn't immediately block our path to the goal and allows us to move closer to the left side, which might help us find a path later.

However, a more promising move would be to move left from (0,2) to (0,1), and then we might be able to move down.

So, the coordinates of my next move would be (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, our current position is now (0,1). We still need to find a path to reach the goal position (2,1).

Since we're directly above the goal, we can try to move down from our current position (0,1) to coordinates (1,1). However, there is a wall at (1,1), which is not a valid move.

We can also try to move down from a different position. Let's consider moving to (0,0) and see if we can create a better path.

But for now, moving to the right doesn't seem helpful. 

However, if we move down from our current column (at (0,1)) from a row below the wall, we could get closer to the goal.

We must therefore find a column that allows us to move down below the wall (at (1,?)).

This can be achieved by going to column 0. Therefore, from (0,1) we should move left.

So, the coordinates of my next move would be (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, our current position is now (0,0). We still need to find a path to reach the goal position (2,1).

Since we are now at the leftmost position, we should focus on finding a way to move down below the wall. We can attempt to move down from a different column, but for now, we need to move to the right to create a potential path.

From our current position (0,0), let's try moving right and then down to see if we can find an alternative route. However, our priority is to find a path that will allow us to move down below the wall.

Considering the current state of the maze, our next move should be to move right from (0,0) to (0,1) but, then we will end up in the previous position and that isn't ideal.

Considering we can only move right (back to our previous position), our best alternative is moving down or right then down but neither of those moves get us closer to the goal right away.

However, in order to be closer to column (2) and row (1), move right for now and see what can we do on the following steps, avoiding reversing back on the previous step.

Let's move to (1 column more), from our current position and for now, right for (1, no). When columns increase we can go down.

So, the coordinates of my next move would be (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, our current position is now (0,1). We still need to find a path to reach the goal position (2,1).

Since we already know that moving down from this position is not valid, we should continue moving right to see if we can find an opening to move down.

However, in the previous steps, we considered moving left to column 0, so we could go down.

So the best next move is to move left.

The coordinates of my next move would be (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back to this position. With the updated maze, our current position is now (0,0). We still need to find a path to reach the goal position (2,1).

As we previously discussed, since we are now at the leftmost position, we should focus on moving down below the wall. 

Notice that the wall only spans 4 units to the right from column 0, so if we move down 2 units and then move to the right, we will be below the wall.

To move down 2 units from our current position (0,0), we need to move to column 0 and row 2.

However, we can't move directly down because there is a wall. Let's try to move down by moving right and then moving down.

Instead of going right from our current position (0,0) to move down afterwards (which wouldn't work) we can't move right because as we move right from column (0,0) the wall prevents us to go down.

However, I noted previously we can go down below the row of 4 walls spanning on column 0. Go to (1 row down), can be only by going on one down so goes (3 rows down).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "U-shape".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0


In this new maze, the empty spaces form a U-shape, providing a valid path from P to G. The maze has the same size as the original and is not an identical copy.
