You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. 

I am currently at position P, which is (0,4). My goal is to reach position G, which is (2,1).

Since I can only move up, down, left, or right to an empty space (0), my next move would be to move left to the adjacent empty space. 

The coordinates of my next move would be (0,3).

Please update the maze with my new position, and I'll plan the next move accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I have moved one step left to (0,3).

To progress, I will move down to the adjacent empty space. This move will help me get closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move would be (1,3).

 Wait, there is a wall at position (1,3) with coordinates full of 1s. So I must change the coordinates of my next move to (0,2).

I'll update, The coordinates of my next move would be (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (0,2). Now I need to get closer to the goal (G) while avoiding walls.

My next move will be to move down to the adjacent empty space. This move will bring me one step closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move would be (1,2). 

Wait, there is a wall at that location. I must change the coordinates of my next move to avoid that wall.

I'll move left to the adjacent empty space.

The coordinates of my next move would be (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
0 G 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (0,1). Now I need to get closer to the goal (G) while avoiding walls.

My next move will be to move down to the adjacent empty space. This move will bring me one step closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move would be (1,1). 

However, there is a wall at (1,1). I must move down through a safe path. In this case I can move to the left.

But at my current position, I can't move left any more. Now I can only move right or down.

Let me try to move down again.

The coordinates of my next move would be (1,1). Wait I already tried this and couldn't.

Let me try a new position.

I can move down right instead. 

No I can move down at another position

I will move down but at x position 0 

The coordinates of my next move would be (1, doesn't work), lets try (1,2) no, lets try the final one, (2,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(distorted) dumbbell shape".


Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a distorted dumbbell shape:


0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 1 0
0 1 1 G 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, and it has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is still recognizable as a distorted dumbbell shape.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
