You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at the bottom middle, and the goal is at the left edge of the fourth row.

The coordinates of the current player position (P) are (4, 2).

Since we want to move towards the goal (G), our initial move should be to move up and left. However, there's a wall directly above us, so we need to navigate around it.

My next move would be to move left to the empty space at coordinates (4, 1).

Please let me know the updated maze after this move. 

Next move: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I'm now in the left middle of the bottom row.

To continue towards the goal, my next move would be to move up to the empty space at coordinates (3, 1). However, there's a wall at that position, so that's not possible.

Instead, I'll move up is not an option, so I'll move right is not getting me closer to the goal, so I'll move left isn't possible as we just came from there, so my next move is  move up isn't an option. I can move to the right but that gets me further from the goal, so I will move left, no that takes me out of bounds... Up and right is the wall,  down is out of bounds. The direct route up is a wall so I have to take a route that isn't up.

My move would be (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've reached the left edge of the bottom row. Now I can start moving up. However, there's a wall directly above me at (3, 0), which blocks my path.

Since moving up is not possible, I'll need to move right to find an alternative route. Looking at the maze, I can see that there's an empty space at coordinates (3, 2) that I might be able to reach if I move right and then up.

However, the right move would be to move up and right at (3, 1), which has a wall, to get to (3, 2) we must get past (3, 1),  So we will need to first get a space that is above a place that can get us around (3,1).

My next move would be to move right to the empty space at coordinates (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back to the same position as before.

To progress, I need to move up, but there's a wall at (3, 1). I need to get around it. Since moving right won't help me get around the wall, I'll move left and try to find a different path.

However, I just came from the left, and moving left again would put me back at the starting point.

Wait, let me re-examine the maze... Ah, I notice that the wall at (3, 1) ends at (3, 2). If I can move up and right, but the wall is in the way, maybe I can move up but at a different spot.

My next move would be to move right to (4, 2), then I'm one spot away from being directly below a spot I can move up.

My next move is: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm in a good position to move up.

I see that the wall at (3, 1) doesn't extend to (3, 2), so if I move up, I should be able to continue making progress towards the goal.

My next move is to move up to the empty space at coordinates (3, 2).

Next move: (3, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or an "L-path", as it has a long horizontal section and a long vertical section that meet at a right angle.

Here is a new maze with the same size as the original, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 G 0
0 0 0 P 1

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and its empty spaces form an L-shape.
