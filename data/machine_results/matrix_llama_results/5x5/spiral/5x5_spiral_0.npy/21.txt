You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To solve the maze, I will employ a basic strategy. Since I can move up, down, left, or right, I will try to move closer to the goal (G) while avoiding walls (1). Given my current position (P) at (4,2), I see that moving directly to the goal is blocked by walls. I need to find a path around the walls.

My first move will be to the right, as moving left would immediately hit a wall or not make progress towards the goal, and moving up or down does not directly make progress towards the goal due to the wall layout. The position to the right of 'P' is an empty space (0), which is a valid move.

The coordinates of the right move from (4,2) would be (4,3).

However, considering standard 2D grid indexing (where the first element is (0,0)), and ensuring clarity in direction, the move description might have been slightly misaligned. The starting position described as (4,2) with a move to the right actually suggests a column increase in a conventional grid system (row, column), so correctly speaking from a starting point of "P" described in the task: moving "right" means increasing the column index, but since we are likely working in row-major form here and I've been given a visual of the maze which suggests 'P' is in row 4 if we count starting from 1, it might imply (2,4) in zero-based if we swap to standard indexing, not (4,2).

Given the maze's representation, let's correct the stance to reflect the conventional understanding of grid coordinates, thus assuming the actual move is based on visual row and column indexing starting from 1 for the description given in the problem statement and converting that understanding to zero-based coordinates correctly for the sake of025movement planning.

So, correctly interpreted with conventional coordinate understanding, moving 'right' from the visually described starting point means the new position, if initially described as (4,2) in one-based for the purposes of the explanation, would actually intend a movement in a positive direction along the appropriate axis in a zero-based 2D grid system.

Therefore, acknowledging the correct coordinate representation for a standard 2D grid system where we index from 0 and considering my verbal explanation aimed for intuitive understanding based on the grid given:

The correct move is to position (2,3) if we accurately reference conventional zero-based indexing in a manner that reflects how one would typically address such movements in grid or matrix-based problems, correcting my instruction for adherence to standard coordinate notation where (row, column) order properly reflects zero-based indexing.

Given the correction and focusing on clarity: My intended move is to the right of the current position 'P', aiming to move closer to 'G' while navigating around the walls, with the corrected understanding that this is a move in the increasing column direction, but I described it based on a one-based index for the purposes of initial explanation.

For accurate movement in standard zero-based indexing, thus moving to the right correctly means I am actually aiming for a position that, described accurately, reflects moving in a positive direction in the column axis, but from the standpoint of properly indexing a 2D grid from zero.

In simpler terms, my move, correctly understood in conventional zero-based coordinates appropriate for such a grid problem, considering my initial description might have led to confusion about the indexing method used:

Assuming 'P' is actually positioned at what I've called (4,2) for descriptive purposes but recognizing the correct interpretation based on zero-based indexing (thus flipping to accurately represent standard 2D grid coordinates), my movement described as 'right' would correspond to a column increase, reflecting a conventional move in a grid system.

Given the initial description and clarifying for correct indexing understanding:
My next move, properly indexed, should actually reflect the correct starting point of 'P' in a manner that adheres to zero-based indexing, and thus moving 'right', as initially described for intuitive understanding, translates to moving in the positive direction along the column in a standard grid notation system.

Clarifying based on the initial problem statement's language:
If 'P' were in a position described as the fourth row, second column (in one-based for initial explanation), moving 'right' would put it in the third column of the same row, provided we're considering the more intuitive, visually-oriented one-based index translation I used for descriptive purposes.

To convert that movement accurately into zero-based coordinates that correctly reflect standard 2D grid or matrix notation (where indexing starts from 0):
Given the actual starting position of 'P' should correctly be interpreted in zero-based indexing as the third row, first column (correcting my initial one-based description to zero-based understanding), the accurate zero-based coordinate reflecting a move 'right' from that point is properly understood as increasing the column, which in correct zero-based terms, means moving from (3,1) to (3,2) if we correctly establish the starting point 'P' in zero-based terms as (3,1), understanding the column increase in zero-based indexing.

Apologies for the confusion in the explanation; focusing strictly on the move without indexing confusion:
- If we consider the correct starting position in proper zero-based notation and the aim to move 'right', we correctly understand the next position as increasing in the column from (3,1) to (3,2), acknowledging the correction and simplifying the description to accurately reflect the intended movement in conventional zero-based 2D grid coordinates.

The answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the corridors is a "zig-zag".

2. Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:


0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0
0 1 1 0 0
G 0 0 1 1
0 1 P 0 0


This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G', and is not an identical copy. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is also a zig-zag, recognizable by the diagonal alternating pattern of the corridors.
