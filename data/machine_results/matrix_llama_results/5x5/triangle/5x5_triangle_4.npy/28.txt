You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (2,2), and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (0,2). 

My next move will be to the right, to the empty space at coordinates (2,3).

However, I noticed that I can move diagonally up and to the left, which would bring me closer to the goal 'G'. 

My next move will be to the position (1,2). No, that's a wall.

My next move will be to the position (2,1). No, that's also a wall.

My next move will be to the position (1,3). No, that's also not possible.

My next move will be to the position (1,1). I'll go up and to the left, diagonally.

My next move will be to the coordinates (1,1).

However, since I am required to move only to the adjacent empty space, I will choose the easiest adjacent empty space.

My next move will be to the coordinates (2,1).

Answer: The coordinates of my next move will be (2,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L" shape.

The original maze has a clear L-shaped path from the top right to the middle left, with the goal 'G' at the top of the L and the current player position 'P' near the corner of the L.

Here is a new maze with the same size and an L-shaped path:

1 1 0 0 0
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1

In this new maze, the L-shaped path is oriented differently, but it still has the same overall shape as the original maze. The current player position 'P' is near the bottom of the L, and the goal 'G' is at the bottom left corner of the maze.
