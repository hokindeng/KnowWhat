You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves. To start, I need to identify the current player position, which is 'P'. I see that 'P' is located at coordinates (2,1).

Before deciding on the next move, I will examine all adjacent positions to find an empty space ('0') to move into. Given the position (2,1), I can potentially move up, down, left, right, or diagonally. After examining all adjacent spaces:

- Moving up to (1,1) results in hitting a wall ('1').
- Moving down to (3,1) results in hitting a wall ('1').
- Moving left to (2,0) results in hitting a wall ('1').
- Moving right to (2,2) is into an empty space ('0').
- Diagonal moves also hit walls except for the diagonal up and to the right, which would be to the position (1,2), placing me closer to the goal but I'll choose the simpler right move for now.

Therefore, my next move will be to the position right of my current location, which is at coordinates (2,2).

My response is:
(2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (2,2) successfully. Now I need to plan my next move based on the updated maze.

From my current position 'P' at (2,2), I'll evaluate all adjacent spaces for a viable move into an empty space ('0'). Considering the possible movements:

- Moving up to (1,2) results in hitting a wall ('1').
- Moving down to (3,2) results in hitting a wall ('1').
- Moving left to (2,1) is into an empty space that I previously occupied, not getting me closer to the goal.
- Moving right to (2,3) results in hitting a wall ('1').
- Moving diagonally up and left to (1,1) results in hitting a wall ('1').
- However, moving diagonally up and right to (1,3) puts me closer to the goal by moving to an empty space ('0') that is near the goal 'G'.

Therefore, my next move will be diagonally up and to the right to the position (1,3).

My response is:
(1,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 P 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've successfully moved to (1,3). Next, I need to plan a move that will get me closer to the goal 'G' at (0,2).

From my current position 'P' at (1,3), I'll examine all adjacent spaces for a viable move:

- Moving up to (0,3) is into an empty space ('0'), which also gets me closer to the goal.
- Moving down to (2,3) results in hitting a wall ('1').
- Moving left to (1,2) results in hitting a wall ('1').
- Moving right to (1,4) results in hitting a wall ('1').
- Diagonal moves either hit walls or do not directly advance me towards the goal.

The most direct path to the goal from here seems to be moving up, as it brings me closer to 'G'.

Therefore, my next move will be up to the position (0,3).

However, after reevaluating the situation, I realize I made a slight mistake in choosing my immediate next step; moving directly towards the goal might involve considering other options that could potentially get me there in fewer steps or with greater assurance. 

But since the only step directly getting closer to the goal from here involves moving up, it seems sensible to proceed as initially decided but then adjust strategy if a better opportunity arises.

My response remains:
(0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G P 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (0,3). Now I'm directly adjacent to the goal 'G'. 

Since my goal is to reach the position marked 'G', and it's right next to me at (0,2), the most logical move is to move left into the goal position, thereby completing the maze.

My response is:
(0,2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as resembling a "staircase" or more broadly, a zigzag or diagonal path that connects the starting position to the goal.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria specified:

1 0 0 0 1
1 P 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar diagonal or zigzag path, resembling a staircase, allowing the player to navigate from 'P' to 'G'. The maze is not identical to the original but maintains the same size and shape characteristics for the empty spaces.
