You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves. To start, I need to identify the current player position, which is 'P'. I see that 'P' is located at coordinates (2,1).

Before deciding on the next move, I will examine all adjacent positions to find an empty space ('0') to move into. Given the position (2,1), I can potentially move up, down, left, right, or diagonally. After examining all adjacent spaces:

- Moving up to (1,1) results in hitting a wall ('1').
- Moving down to (3,1) results in hitting a wall ('1').
- Moving left to (2,0) results in hitting a wall ('1').
- Moving right to (2,2) is into an empty space ('0').
- Diagonal moves also hit walls except for the diagonal up and to the right, which would be to the position (1,2), placing me closer to the goal but I'll choose the simpler right move for now.

Therefore, my next move will be to the position right of my current location, which is at coordinates (2,2).

My response is:
(2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved to (2,2) and the maze has been updated, I see that the current position of 'P' is indeed at (2,2). 

Next, I examine the adjacent spaces for my next move:

- Moving up to (1,2) involves moving into a wall ('1'), which is not allowed.
- Moving down to (3,2) also results in hitting a wall ('1').
- Moving left to (2,1) would be moving back to the previous position, which does not progress towards the goal.
- Moving right to (2,3) hits a wall ('1').
- Moving diagonally up and left to (1,1) hits a wall, and moving diagonally down and left also hits a wall.
- Moving diagonally up and right to (1,3) is into an empty space ('0').

Considering these options, my next move will be diagonally up and right from my current position, to the coordinates (1,3).

My response is:
(1,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 P 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've successfully moved to (1,3). Considering my options from this new position:

- Moving up is not an option since I am already near the top of the maze and moving up to (0,3) isn't a valid space since it's out of the maze's bounds, but I can see the goal ('G') is actually to my left now.
- Moving down to (2,3) hits a wall ('1').
- Moving left to (1,2) is into a wall ('1'), but moving left to (1,1) could be an option, though I see a clearer path by moving left directly towards the goal.
- Moving right to (1,4) hits a wall ('1').
- Diagonal moves are either out of bounds or into a wall except for diagonally down and left, which doesn't seem necessary given the goal's proximity.

Given that the goal 'G' is so close, my best move would be to move directly towards it. Therefore, my next move will be left, towards the goal 'G', which means moving to (1,2) isn't ideal because it's a wall, so I actually need to move left two spaces from (1,3) to (1,1), but G is more up and to the left. My next move will thus be one space up isn't necessary but moving left two spaces from my current location is essentially trying to move left towards the goal the most directly way, landing me at coordinates (1,1) or actually more specifically (0,2), closer or (1,1), then push to goal G on the next turn after reconsideration.

My reconsideration suggests the move should actually position me closer, without hitting walls so actually positioning at (1,2) is a bad move when the wall can be flanked moving diagonally up and left to be right next to the goal instead at given coordinates if directly moving: left.

My response to place me next to G is moving to (0,2).
(0,2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a zigzag path or an "S" shape, specifically connecting the starting point P to the goal G through diagonal and horizontal moves primarily.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "S" shape:


1 0 1 0 0
1 0 0 G 1
1 1 P 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1


This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original, and its empty spaces form a recognizable "S" shape. Note that while the overall shape is similar, the path and specific layout are different from the original maze.
