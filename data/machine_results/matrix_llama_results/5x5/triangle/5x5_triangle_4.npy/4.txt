You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (2, 1), marked by 'P'. The goal position is at (0, 2), marked by 'G'. 

Considering the possible moves in all eight directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals), I will choose the move that gets me closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

My next move will be up-left, which is the position (1, 0), but that is not an option because it's blocked by a wall. The closest empty space is (2, 0), which is not optimal but the only viable option at the moment. 

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 0).

After making this move, the maze will be updated to reflect my new position, and I'll wait for the updated maze to plan my next move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size (5x5), same encoding, and empty spaces that form an L-shape:

1 1 1 1 G
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form an L-shape, but the position of the player (P) and the goal (G) are different from the original maze. The maze is not identical to the original, but the general shape of the path remains the same.
