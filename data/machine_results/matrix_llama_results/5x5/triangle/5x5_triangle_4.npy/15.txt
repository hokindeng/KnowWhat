You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves step-by-step to reach the goal position (G).

The initial maze is:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

My current position is at (2, 1), which is marked as 'P'.

Since I can move up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space, I will analyze my options. 

To move closer to the goal (G) at (0, 2), I will choose to move up and right (diagonally) to the position (1, 2).

However, that position is blocked by a wall (1), so I will instead move up to the position (1, 1), which is an empty space.

Therefore, my next move will be to the coordinates (1, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (1, 1) and the updated maze is:

1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

To reach the goal (G) at (0, 2), I will try to move up and right. However, the position directly above me is a wall, so I will move right to (1, 2), but that's a wall too.

In that case, I will move right and up (diagonally) is not possible, but I can move up to (0, 1), which is an empty space.

Therefore, my next move will be to the coordinates (0, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 P G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (0, 1) and the updated maze is:

1 P G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Since my goal (G) is at (0, 2), which is adjacent to my current position, I will move right to (0, 2) to reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move will be to the coordinates (0, 2).

Please let me know if I've solved the maze!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a zigzag or a curved path.

Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same zigzag or curved path shape:


1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 G
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1


Please note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it shares the same general shape formed by the empty spaces, which is a zigzag or curved path.
