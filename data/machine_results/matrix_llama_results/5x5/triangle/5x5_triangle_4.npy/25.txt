You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.


The maze is:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1


I can see that the goal position (G) is at coordinates (0,2). The current player position (P) is at coordinates (2,1). Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position, I will move the player to the empty space at coordinates (2,2), which is to the right of the current position.

My next move is to (2,2).


Please update the maze with my new position and let me know the new state of the maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.


The maze is:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1


My goal is to reach the goal position (G) at coordinates (0,2). Since I'm currently at coordinates (2,2), I'll move up towards the goal. I can see that the space directly above me at coordinates (1,2) is a wall (1), so I'll move diagonally up-left to the empty space at coordinates (1,1).


My next move is to (1,1).


Please update the maze with my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll plan my next move.


The maze is:

1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1


My goal is still to reach the goal position (G) at coordinates (0,2). Since I'm currently at coordinates (1,1), I can see that I'm getting closer to the goal. I'll move up-left to the empty space at coordinates (0,1), which will put me even closer to the goal.


My next move is to (0,1).


Please update the maze with my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 P G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll plan my next move.


The maze is:

1 P G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1


Since I'm currently at coordinates (0,1) and the goal position (G) is at coordinates (0,2), I can simply move right to reach the goal!


My next move is to (0,2).


This should put me at the goal position and complete the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L-shape" or a right angle.


(2) Here is a new maze with the same size (5x5), where the empty spaces form a similar L-shape:


1 1 1 0 0
1 P 0 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 1


Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces in this new maze also form an L-shape.
