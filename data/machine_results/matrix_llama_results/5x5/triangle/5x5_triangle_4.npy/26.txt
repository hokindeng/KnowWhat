You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). My current position is at (2,1), and my goal is at (0,2).

For my next move, I plan to move up one space to (1,1). This space is empty, as it's represented by a '0'.

My next move is to position (1,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move to get closer to the goal position (G) at (0,2). Since I'm currently at (1,1), I will move up and to the right to position (0,2), but that would be the goal position itself, and I don't think I can move directly there.

A better move would be to move up to position (0,1). This space is empty, as it's adjacent to the wall represented by a '1' and a space represented by a '0'.

My next move is to position (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 P G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move to get closer to the goal position (G) at (0,2). Since I'm currently at (0,1), I will move right to position (0,2). This space is the goal position itself, represented by a 'G'.

My next move is to position (0,2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(distorted) stairway" or an "L-shape with a single diagonal step".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 P 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1


In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a distorted stairway or L-shape with a single diagonal step, but the maze is not an identical copy of the original. The path from P to G can be reached through the empty spaces.
