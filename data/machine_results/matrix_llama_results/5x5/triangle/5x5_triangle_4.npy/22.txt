You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (2, 1), marked by 'P'. The goal position is at (0, 2), marked by 'G'. 

Considering the possible moves and the constraint of avoiding walls, my next move will be to the right of the current position, to the empty space at coordinates (2, 2).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (2, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and let me know the new state of the maze so I can plan my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

Since I'm now at (2, 2), marked by 'P', my goal is still to reach (0, 2), marked by 'G'.

My next move will be up to the empty space at coordinates (1, 2).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (1, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and let me know the new state of the maze.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L-shape" or an "Elbow shape", with a vertical section connecting to a horizontal section.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 G
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape or Elbow shape.
