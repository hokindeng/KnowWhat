You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (2, 1), marked by 'P'. The goal position is at (0, 2), marked by 'G'. 

Considering the available empty spaces and the goal position, I decide to move up to the position (1, 1).

My next move will be to the coordinates (1, 1).

Please update the maze and present it to me again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

The current player position is now at (1, 1), marked by 'P'. The goal position remains at (0, 2), marked by 'G'.

Considering the available empty spaces and the goal position, I decide to move up-left to the position (0, 1).

However, since the goal position is close, I can also try to move directly to the goal. Moving diagonally up-right to the position (0, 2) seems like a viable option.

My next move will be to the coordinates (0, 2).

Please update the maze and present it to me again.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L-shape" or "L-corridor".

The original maze had an L-shaped corridor that connected the starting position (P) to the goal position (G).

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 0 0
1 P 0 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape that connects the starting position (P) to the goal position (G). The L-shape is not identical to the original maze, but it is recognizable as the same general shape.
