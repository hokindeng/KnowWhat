You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I see that the current player position (P) is at coordinates (2,1). I also see that the goal position (G) is at coordinates (0,2). My plan is to move towards the goal by taking the shortest path while avoiding walls. 

Since I can move to any adjacent empty space, including diagonals, I will move up and right, to position (1,2). However, I see that the space (1,2) is occupied by a wall. Therefore, I need to find an alternative move.

A possible move is to go up to the empty space at coordinates (1,1). This move gets me closer to the goal position while avoiding the walls.

My next move is to the coordinates (1,1).

Please update the maze with my new position and let me know the new situation.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Since I've moved to position (1,1), I now need to navigate around the wall to my right and make progress towards the goal position (G) at (0,2).

A possible move is to go left to the empty space at coordinates (1,0), and then I can consider moving up towards the goal.

My next move is to the coordinates (1,0).

Please update the maze with my new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a zigzag path or, more specifically, an "S-shape" or an "inverted S-shape".


Here's a new maze with the same size and shape:

1 0 G 0 1
1 0 1 0 0
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1

This maze has the same dimensions as the original, but with a different wall configuration that still forms an S-shaped path from P to G.
