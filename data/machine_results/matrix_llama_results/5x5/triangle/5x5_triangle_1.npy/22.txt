You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Current player position (P) is at coordinates (3, 3) and the goal position (G) is at coordinates (2, 0). Since we can move in any diagonal direction, I will move diagonally up and to the left. 

The coordinates of my next move will be (2, 2).

Please update the maze and provide it to me again so that I can plan my next move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a diagonal path, but upon closer inspection, it can be observed that the empty spaces form an 'L' shape. This L-shape may not be immediately noticeable due to the diagonal connection.

(2) Below is a new maze that is 5x5, with the empty spaces forming an 'L' shape:


1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 G 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1


This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and its corridors also form an L-shape.
