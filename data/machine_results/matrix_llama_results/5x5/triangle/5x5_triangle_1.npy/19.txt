You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). My next move will be to an empty space adjacent to my current position.

I will move diagonally up and to the left. My current position is P at coordinates (3,4). My next move will be to the position at coordinates (2,3).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move to continue navigating towards the goal position (G). My current position is P at coordinates (2,3).

My next move will be to an empty space adjacent to my current position. I will move left. 

So, the coordinates of my next move are (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting closer to the goal. My current position is P at coordinates (2,2). My next move will be to an empty space adjacent to my current position.

I will move left again.

So, the coordinates of my next move are (2,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.My current position is P at coordinates (2,1), which is right next to the goal (G). My next move will be to the goal position itself.

I will move left.

So, the coordinates of my next move are (2,0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a diagonal corridor.

Here's a new maze with the same size, where the empty spaces form a similar diagonal corridor:

1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 G 0 P
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a diagonal corridor, allowing the player to move from the starting position P to the goal position G. The maze is not identical to the original, but the shape of the corridors is similar.
