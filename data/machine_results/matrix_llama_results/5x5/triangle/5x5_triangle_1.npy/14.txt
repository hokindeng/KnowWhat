You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at (3, 4), and the goal is at (2, 0).

A possible next move would be to move diagonally up-left to the empty space at (2, 3).

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the player now at (2, 3), a good next move would be to move diagonally up-left to the empty space at (2, 2) is already occupied by the goal "G" but but since (2, 2) is already at a distance of a single move from the current player and (2, 2) already being the goal, the player should move up to the empty space (2, 2) however moving diagonally to space adjacent to the goal is the ideal move so it move left and up to  (2, 2), no instead move left, the coordinates of my next move are: (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (2, 2). A good next move would be to move left to the goal position, which is at (2, 0) but P would take the place of the goal "G". however I will assume the goal stays at (2,0) whose current position is occupied with G thus with P moving to the Goal whose the position is (2,0) should remain and is solved , however assuming the goal stays thus "P" needs just  move left so the coordinates of my next move are: (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the player now at (2, 1), the final move would be to move left to the goal position at (2, 0), so the coordinates of my next move are: (2, 0).

This should solve the maze!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

This maze meets the criteria, having an L-shaped corridor of empty spaces that connects the starting point (P) to the goal (G). The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape and structure.
