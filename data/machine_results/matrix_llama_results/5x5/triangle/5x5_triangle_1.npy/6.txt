You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Current player position (P) is at coordinates (3, 3) or row 3, column 3 if we consider the top-left corner as (0, 0). Since I can move to any adjacent empty space (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), I need to identify the available empty spaces around the current position.

From the current position at (3, 3), moving:
- Upwards is blocked by a wall.
- Downwards is also blocked by a wall.
- Leftwards is a possible move to an empty space.
- Rightwards is blocked by a wall.
- Diagonally up-left and up-right are blocked by walls.
- Diagonally down-left and down-right are blocked by walls.

Considering the goal position (G) is located at coordinates (2, 0), I will plan my movement to eventually reach the goal. Given the immediate options, moving leftwards to an empty space seems to be the best choice as it potentially brings me closer to the goal or provides more movement options in the next step.

Therefore, my next move would be to the left, to the coordinates (3, 2) or row 3, column 2.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze appears to be an inverted "T" or a rotated "L" shape, but given the connecting empty spaces, it more resembles a path or corridor system that could be abstractly described as forming a rough, inverted L-shape or a rectangle with a single corridor extending from it.

However, if we simplify the description based on the main path from P to G, it could be seen as forming a "Hook" shape, considering the way it turns from a generally straight path into a turn towards the goal. This interpretation is quite abstract, given the simplicity and constraints of the maze.

(2) Below is a new maze that meets the specified criteria: it's the same size, not an identical copy, includes a path from P to G, and the corridors form a shape that could similarly be described in simple geometric terms, in this case, maintaining a simplistic approach, it could also be viewed as forming a type of "Hook" shape due to the nature of the path.
