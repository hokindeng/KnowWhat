You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at 'P' and the goal position is at 'G'.

First, I'll find the coordinates of the current player position 'P' and the goal position 'G'. 

The coordinates of 'P' are (2,4), and the coordinates of 'G' are (2,0).

Next, I'll look for adjacent empty spaces around 'P' where I can move. 

The adjacent empty spaces are up: (1,4), left: (2,3), up-left: (1,3), and up-right is not possible as it's out of the maze.

I'll choose to move up-left to (1,3), as this move reduces the distance to 'G' the most.

So, the coordinates of my next move are (1,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 P 1
G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the updated maze. The current player position is now at 'P' which is (1,3) and the goal position 'G' is still at (2,0).

Next, I'll look for adjacent empty spaces around 'P' where I can move.

The adjacent empty spaces are up: is not possible as it's a wall, right: is not possible as it's a wall, down: (2,3), left: (1,2) is not possible as it's a wall, up-left is not possible as it's a wall, down-left: (2,2), up-right is not possible as it's a wall, and down-right is not possible as it's out of the maze.

I'll choose to move down to (2,3), as this move gets me closer to 'G' and potentially opens up more paths to reach 'G'.

So, the coordinates of my next move are (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the updated maze. The current player position is now at 'P' which is (2,3) and the goal position 'G' is still at (2,0).

Next, I'll look for adjacent empty spaces around 'P' where I can move.

The adjacent empty spaces are left: (2,2), and left is closer to 'G'.

I'll choose to move left to (2,2), as this move gets me closer to 'G' and potentially opens up more paths to reach 'G'.

So, the coordinates of my next move are (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the updated maze. The current player position is now at 'P' which is (2,2) and the goal position 'G' is still at (2,0).

Next, I'll look for adjacent empty spaces around 'P' where I can move.

The adjacent empty spaces are left: (2,1), and left is closer to 'G'.

I'll choose to move left to (2,1), as this move gets me closer to 'G'.

So, the coordinates of my next move are (2,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the updated maze. The current player position is now at 'P' which is (2,1) and the goal position 'G' is at (2,0), right next to 'P'.

Since 'G' is adjacent to 'P', I can move directly to the goal position.

So, the coordinates of my next move are (2,0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a "bent path".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:
```
1 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```
In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape that allows the player to move from the starting position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it retains the same general shape and structure.
