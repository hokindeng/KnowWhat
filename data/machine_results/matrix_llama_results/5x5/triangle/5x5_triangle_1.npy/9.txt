You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at (3, 4), and the goal is at (2, 0).

A possible next move would be to move diagonally up-left to the empty space at (2, 3).

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the player now at (2, 3), a good next move would be to move diagonally up-left to the empty space at (2, 2) is also a good option, but moving left to the empty space at (2, 2) puts us in a great position to move up.

However moving left to (2, 2) is the best move.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that the player is at (2, 2), I can see that the goal (G) is within reach. A good next move would be to move left to the goal position at (2, 0).

However, I notice that I can move left to (2,1) and then move left to (2,0) is also possible

But the best move is to move left to (2, 1).

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the player now at (2, 1), I see that I'm right next to the goal position (G) at (2, 0). A good next move would be to move left to the goal position.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (2, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would say that:

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
G 0 1 P 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape that connects the goal position (G) to the player position (P). The maze is not identical to the original, but it has the same general shape and a valid path from P to G.
