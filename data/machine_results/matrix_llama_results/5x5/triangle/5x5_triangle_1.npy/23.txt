You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at 'P' and the goal position is at 'G'.

First, I'll find the coordinates of the current player position 'P' and the goal position 'G'. 

The coordinates of 'P' are (3, 3) and the coordinates of 'G' are (2, 0).

Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position, I'll look at the options:

Moving up: (2, 3) is empty. 
Moving down: not possible since it's out of bounds.
Moving left: (3, 2) is empty.
Moving right: not possible since it's out of bounds.
Moving diagonally up-left: (2, 2) is empty.

To make progress towards the goal, I'll move diagonally up-left to (2, 2).

So, my next move is to the coordinates (2, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would say that the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a "Z shape" or a "zigzag path".

Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same Z shape:


1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 1 0 P
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it still has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a Z shape.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
