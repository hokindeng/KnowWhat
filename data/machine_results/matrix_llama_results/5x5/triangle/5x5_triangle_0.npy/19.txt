You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 0 0 P 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). My next move will be to an empty space adjacent to my current position.

I'm currently at the position marked 'P', which seems to be at (4,3) considering the bottom left corner where 'P' is positioned. My next move will be to move up one space, since moving down would put me outside the maze or into a wall, and moving left or diagonally left would put me into a wall as well. Moving right is not an option because there is a wall to my right.

Therefore, my next move is to the space directly above me, which is empty. The coordinates of this space are (4,2).

Please present the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 0 P 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will plan my next move to continue navigating towards the goal position (G). Since my current position is (4,2) and I can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal) to an adjacent empty space, I will consider the most direct path towards the goal.

The goal (G) is located at (3,1), so my next move should bring me closer to it while avoiding the wall directly above me. I notice that I can move diagonally up and left to the space at (3,2), which is empty.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (3,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a zigzag or a curved path.

Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same zigzag or curved path shape:


1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 1 0 P 1


Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a zigzag or curved path.
