You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 0 0 P 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (4,3). I can see that the goal G is located at (3,1). To reach the goal, I will need to move upwards through the empty spaces.

For my next move, I will choose to move to the position (3,3), which is an empty space adjacent to my current position.

My next move will be: (3,3)

Please provide the updated maze for me to continue solving it.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 P 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I've moved up to (3,3). 

For my next move, I will try to move closer to the goal position G. I can see an empty space diagonally up and to the left, which would bring me closer to the goal.

My next move will be: (2,2)

Please provide the updated maze for me to continue solving it.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I've moved diagonally up and to the left to (2,2).

For my next move, I will try to move closer to the goal position G. I can see an empty space up and to the left, but that would put me in a position where I wouldn't be able to move further towards the goal. Instead, I will move to the empty space to the right, which would allow me to maintain my upward momentum towards the goal.

My next move will be: (2,3)

Please provide the updated maze for me to continue solving it.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 P 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I've moved right to (2,3).

For my next move, I will try to move closer to the goal position G. I can see an empty space diagonally down and to the left, which would bring me right next to the goal.

My next move will be: (3,2)

Alternatively, if diagonal moves are not allowed in this specific case (although it was mentioned that they are allowed in general), I can choose a different move. However, I will try the diagonal move first.

Please provide the updated maze for me to continue solving it.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A Zigzag or a Staircase shape.

The empty spaces form a zigzag path that connects the starting point P to the goal point G.

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 G 1
0 P 0 0 1

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is also recognizable as a zigzag or staircase shape.
