You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 0 0 P 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (4,3). I can see that the goal G is located at (3,0). My next move will be to an adjacent empty space that can potentially lead me closer to the goal. 

After examining the maze, I decide to move to the empty space directly above my current position, which is (3,3).

My next move will be to coordinates (3,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 P 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my new position at (3,3), I can re-evaluate the maze to plan my next step.

To move closer to the goal, I will try to reach the empty space to the left of my current position, which is (3,2). This position appears to be connected to other empty spaces, and potentially, a path to the goal.

My next move will be to coordinates (3,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A "L" shape

The "L" shape is formed by the empty spaces, starting from the goal position (G) and moving downwards, then connecting to the horizontal corridor where the player position (P) is located.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "L" shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
0 0 0 P 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and has a recognizable "L" shape formed by its empty spaces. Note that the exact position and orientation of the "L" shape are different from the original maze.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
