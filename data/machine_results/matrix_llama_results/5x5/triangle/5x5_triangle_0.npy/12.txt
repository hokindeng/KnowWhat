You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 0 0 P 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (4,3). I can see that the goal G is located at (3,0). Since I can move in any of the eight adjacent directions, I will choose a move that gets me closer to the goal. 

Looking at the maze, I see that moving up one step would get me closer to the goal while staying in an empty space. Therefore, my next move would be to move up to position (3,3).

The coordinates of my next move are (3,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 P 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I'm now closer to the goal. My next objective is to get past the wall that separates me from the goal.

I'm currently at position P (3,3). If I move diagonally up and left, I'll get closer to the goal while staying in an empty space. 

The coordinates of my next move are (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I've made good progress.

I'm currently at position P (2,2). My goal is still to get past the wall and reach the goal. Moving diagonally up and left again would get me even closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are (1,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "staircase" or an "L-shape" with a diagonal connection.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same general shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 G 1 0 P
0 0 0 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a staircase or L-shape with a diagonal connection, but the layout is different from the original maze. The player can navigate from P to G through the empty spaces, avoiding walls.
