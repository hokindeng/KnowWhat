You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 0 0 P 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (4,3). I can see that the goal G is located at (3,0). To reach the goal, I will need to navigate through empty spaces while avoiding walls. I'll examine the adjacent positions to determine the best move.

The available adjacent positions are:

- Up: (3,3) is a wall, so this is not a valid move.
- Down: (5,3) is out of the maze bounds, so this is not a valid move.
- Left: (4,2) is an empty space, which is a valid move.
- Right: (4,4) is a wall, so this is not a valid move.
- Diagonal up-left: (3,2) is a wall, so this is not a valid move.
- Diagonal up-right: (3,4) is a wall, so this is not a valid move.
- Diagonal down-left: (5,2) is out of the maze bounds, so this is not a valid move.
- Diagonal down-right: (5,4) is out of the maze bounds, so this is not a valid move.

Considering these options, the best move is to the left: (4,2).

My next move is to position (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 0 P 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position P (4,2). I can see that the goal G is still located at (3,0). To reach the goal, I will need to navigate through empty spaces while avoiding walls. I'll examine the adjacent positions to determine the best move.

The available adjacent positions are:

- Up: (3,2) is a wall, so this is not a valid move.
- Down: (5,2) is out of the maze bounds, so this is not a valid move.
- Left: (4,1) is an empty space, which is a valid move.
- Right: (4,3) is an empty space that I came from, but it's still a valid move.
- Diagonal up-left: (3,1) is a wall, so this is not a valid move.
- Diagonal up-right: (3,3) is a wall, so this is not a valid move.
- Diagonal down-left: (5,1) is out of the maze bounds, so this is not a valid move.
- Diagonal down-right: (5,3) is out of the maze bounds, so this is not a valid move.

Considering these options, the best move is to the left: (4,1).

My next move is to position (4,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 P 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at position P (4,1). I can see that the goal G is still located at (3,0). To reach the goal, I will need to navigate through empty spaces while avoiding walls. I'll examine the adjacent positions to determine the best move.

The available adjacent positions are:

- Up: (3,1) is a wall, so this is not a valid move.
- Down: (5,1) is out of the maze bounds, so this is not a valid move.
- Left: (4,0) is an empty space, which is a valid move.
- Right: (4,2) is an empty space that I came from, but it's still a valid move.
- Diagonal up-left: (3,0) is the goal G, but I'm not sure if I can move diagonally to the goal. To be safe, I'll consider other options first.
- Diagonal up-right: (3,2) is a wall, so this is not a valid move.
- Diagonal down-left: (5,0) is out of the maze bounds, so this is not a valid move.
- Diagonal down-right: (5,2) is out of the maze bounds, so this is not a valid move.

Considering these options, the best move is to the left: (4,0).

However, since the goal is diagonally up-left from my current position, I can try to move diagonally to the goal (3,0) if it's allowed. If not, I will stick with my initial choice of moving left to (4,0).

My preferred next move is to position (3,0) if diagonal moves to the goal are allowed. Otherwise, my next move is to position (4,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
P 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at position P (4,0). I can see that the goal G is located diagonally up-right at (3,1). However, I am already at the left edge of the maze, and my options are limited.

The available adjacent positions are:

- Up: (3,0) is a wall, so this is not a valid move.
- Down: (5,0) is out of the maze bounds, so this is not a valid move.
- Left: There is no left position, as I am at the edge of the maze.
- Right: (4,1) is an empty space that I came from, but it's still a valid move.
- Diagonal up-right: (3,1) is the goal G, which is a valid move.

Considering these options, the best move is to move diagonally up-right to the goal G at position (3,1).

My next move is to position (3,1), which should take me directly to the goal G.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as an "L" shape, with a short segment extending downwards from the main L.

Here is a new maze with the same size (5x5), with empty spaces that form an L shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1
1 P 0 0 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces form an L shape, with a short segment extending downwards from the main L. The maze is not an identical copy of the original maze.
