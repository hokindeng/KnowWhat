You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 0 0 P 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (4, 3). Since the goal 'G' is at coordinates (1, 3), we need to navigate upwards.

Looking around the current position 'P', we can move either up or left or diagonally up-left into the adjacent empty spaces. However, since we ultimately need to move up to reach the goal, it's most efficient to move diagonally up-left for now to cover the most distance towards the goal.

So, my next move would be to coordinates (3, 2). 

Please update the maze and let me know the new situation.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A Staircase or a Zigzag

The empty spaces in the original maze form a staircase-like shape that zigzags from the top-right to the bottom-left.

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same staircase or zigzag shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 G 1
1 P 0 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a zigzag shape that allows the player to navigate from the starting position 'P' to the goal position 'G'. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it retains the same general shape and structure.
