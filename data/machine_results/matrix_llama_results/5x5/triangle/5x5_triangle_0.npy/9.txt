You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 0 0 P 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Current player position (P) is at coordinates (4, 2), and the goal position (G) is at coordinates (3, 1). Since we can move in any diagonal direction, I will move diagonally up and left to get closer to the goal.

My next move will be to coordinates (3, 1) is not possible since there is a wall above and left of the current position 'P'. The valid move to get closer to the goal is moving up one step.

My next move will be to coordinates (3, 2).

Please let me know the updated maze after this move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Dogleg" or a "Right-angled Zigzag". This shape is characterized by two straight sections that form a right angle.

(2) Here is a new maze with empty spaces that form the same Dogleg shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 G 1
0 0 0 P 1

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and has a recognizable Dogleg shape formed by its empty spaces. Note that I've flipped the orientation of the Dogleg shape to create a new maze that is not identical to the original.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
