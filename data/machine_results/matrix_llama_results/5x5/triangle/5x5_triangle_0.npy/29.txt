You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 0 0 P 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves to reach the goal position 'G'. I will follow a straightforward pathfinding approach for simplicity. Given the current player position 'P' is at (4,3) and the goal 'G' is at (3,1), considering the maze's layout, a good initial move would be to move the player up to get closer to the goal and avoid being trapped by the walls.

My next move would be to (4,2). This move is chosen because it moves towards the goal without moving into a wall, and it keeps options open for the next moves.

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 0 P 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and my current position at (4,2), my next move aims to move closer to the goal 'G' while avoiding walls. A safe and progression-oriented move would be to move diagonally up-left to (3,1), but since 'G' is at that position and I need to land on an empty space, I'll choose to move left to (3,2) which is an empty space adjacent to my current position and brings me closer to 'G'.

My next move would be to (3,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as roughly forming an "L" shape. This is because if you trace the path from the starting point 'P' to the goal 'G', the overall direction changes once, essentially forming an L.

2. Here is a new maze that is the same size as the original, with empty spaces that also form an L shape, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 G 1
1 P 0 0 1

This new maze retains the L shape formed by the empty spaces while providing a distinct layout and a valid path from 'P' to 'G'.
