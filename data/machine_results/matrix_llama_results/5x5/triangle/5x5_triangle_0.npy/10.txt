You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 0 0 P 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my move. To navigate from the current player position 'P' to the goal position 'G', my first move will be towards the goal while avoiding walls and considering the possible diagonal movement.

Given the maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 G 1 0 1
0 0 0 P 1

My current position 'P' is at (4, 3). My goal 'G' is at (3, 1). A logical first step considering the layout and aiming to get closer to 'G' while avoiding obstacles would be to move diagonally up-left from (4, 3) towards the empty space. This would place me at (3, 2), but since diagonal moves are allowed and I need to get closer to the goal, I will aim directly for the most efficient path towards 'G' without hitting a wall.

My best immediate move, given the constraints and the aim to reduce the distance to 'G' efficiently without specifying intermediate steps that could be inferred by the given rules (moving through empty spaces, avoiding walls, and the ability to move diagonally), is up-left but in a way that maximizes my approach to 'G'. However, to ensure clarity and adherence to the instructions for a direct next move in a simple maze solution format without excessive steps or deemed calculation beyond immediate action, I will clarify the logic to the direct diagonal approach towards 'G':

To get closer to 'G' at (3, 1) from 'P' at (4, 3), the most direct diagonal move towards the goal without specifying further intent would indeed consider the direct path, but given the need for step-by-step solution logic in a maze-solving context where I can only provide one immediate move and need to drag the decision based on optimal path logic towards 'G':

I should ensure the move reduces distance effectively towards 'G' while maintaining adherence to possible actions. However, acknowledging a strict interpretation of the instructions for a clear and direct next step without assuming multi-step intentions beyond what's provided in the prompt and ensuring alignment with the aimed format for a direct response without additional movements or intended path predictions beyond the current immediate decision need, I'll correct the thought process to focus on an optimal immediate action:

Since diagonal moves are allowed, considering a direct approach towards the goal in terms of reducing distance effectively while moving diagonally can be optimal. The immediate, direct move should aim towards reducing the distance most efficiently with the given maze's constraints and allowed movements, particularly highlighting the potential of utilizing diagonal moves for closer alignment to an optimal path.

The direct move, considering immediate distance reduction and alignment towards the goal without overstepping or predicting further actions beyond the immediate step required by the question's format and ensuring clarity on the direct approach's logic for the most immediate move without intermediate steps, involves considering direct diagonal movement for optimal alignment and distance reduction based on the maze layout and the positions of 'P' and 'G'.

Therefore, considering direct diagonal movement logic for the most immediate step that reduces distance efficiently towards 'G':

My next move will be diagonally to the position (3, 2).

So, my next move is (3, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the given maze can be described as an 'L-shape'. This is because the empty spaces (corridors) when connected, visually form a shape that resembles an 'L'.

2. Here is a new maze that meets the required criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 0 1 1
0 0 P 0 1

This maze has the same size as the original, is not an identical copy, and includes a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces that form an 'L-shape'.
