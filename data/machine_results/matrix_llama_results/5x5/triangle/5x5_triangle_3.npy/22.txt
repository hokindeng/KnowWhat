You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position (P) is at the bottom of the maze, and the goal position (G) is above it. Since we can move diagonally, we'll aim to get as close to the goal as possible while avoiding walls.

My next move is to move diagonally up-right to the empty space. The new coordinates of the player position (P) will be (4, 3).

Please update the maze and provide the next version for further analysis.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll plan my next move. I'll move diagonally up-right to the empty space again. The new coordinates of the player position (P) will be (3, 3).

However, since the maze coordinates are 0-indexed (starting from 0), I'll provide the coordinates accordingly. My next move is to position (3, 3) -> ( row: 3, column: 3 doesn't work so I need) column: 4 doesn't work. I need  move to column 3), however (3, 2) does work so coordinates (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 P 1 0
1 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll move up to the empty space that is available to reach the goal (G) position more easily, but (2, 3) has a wall and (2, 2) has a wall so the choice I have is to move up and left (up-left) so My next move is to position (2, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner path", since it has a long corridor that turns into a shorter one, forming a corner.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 G 1 1
1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 P 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar L-shape, but the path is located in a different part of the maze, and the walls are arranged differently. The goal (G) and player position (P) are also placed in a way that requires the player to navigate through the L-shaped corridor to reach the goal.
