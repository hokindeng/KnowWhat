You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Current player position (P) is at the bottom right corner of the maze, and the goal position (G) is above it. The most direct path to the goal seems to be navigating upwards. However, since diagonal movements are allowed, I can also consider moving diagonally up-left to reach the empty space that is two spaces above and one space to the left of my current position.

Considering the options, I'll choose to move up one space to the empty space above my current position.

Current position: (4, 4)
New position: (3, 4)

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

(Note: I'm assuming coordinates in the format (row, column) starting from (0,0) at the top left corner of the maze.)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is an "L" shape or a rectangle with a long, thin protrusion.

(2) Here is a new maze that meets the specified criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 0 G
1 1 0 0 1
1 0 0 P 1

This maze is a new instance of the same size (5x5), with empty spaces forming a similar L-shape or rectangular shape with a protrusion. The maze is not identical to the original, but still has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces.
