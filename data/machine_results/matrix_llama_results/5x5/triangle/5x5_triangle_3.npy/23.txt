You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position (P) is at the bottom of the maze, and the goal position (G) is above it. Since we can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, the best next move would be to move up and to the right, getting closer to the goal.

The current position (P) is at (4, 4). My next move will be up and to the right, to position (3, 3).

However, there's a wall at (3, 3), so I'll move up to (3, 4) instead.

My next move is to (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 P
1 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Since I'm now at (3, 4) and my goal is to reach the goal (G), I notice that there's an empty space to the left of the goal. I'll try to move closer to it.

My next move is to (3, 3), but again, there's a wall there, so I'll move left to (3, 2) instead, but that's also a wall, so I'll move left again, but the wall also exists at (3,1), and at (3,0). 

Let's move up one space and then left. I can move up to (2, 4), which is not blocked.

My next move is to (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G P
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 4) and adjacent to the goal (G), which is at (2, 3), my next move is to move to the goal position.

My next move is to (2, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as an "L" shape, with the addition of an extra empty space at the top right.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L shape:


1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 0
1 P 0 0 G
