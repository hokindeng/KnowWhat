You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position (P)
The current player position (P) is at the coordinates (4, 4).

## Step 2: Identify the goal position (G)
The goal position (G) is at the coordinates (2, 3).

## Step 3: Examine the adjacent positions to the current player position (P)
The adjacent positions to the current player position (P) at (4, 4) are (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 4), and (5, 5). We can ignore (5, 4) and (5, 5) as they are outside the maze. We also ignore (4, 5) as it is also outside the maze.

## Step 4: Filter out positions that are walls (1) or outside the maze boundaries
Position (3, 4) has a wall, (3, 3) is inside the maze but not directly adjacent in the four main directions (up, down, left, right), and position (5, 3) is outside the boundaries of the maze while position (3, 5) does not exist. Position (4, 3) is available.

## Step 5: Choose the most direct path to the goal position (G)
We need to select a position that moves closer to the goal (G) at (2, 3). Among the possible moves, moving up is the best choice as it directly approaches the goal. However, we can only go left at this point to move closer to the goal in the least number of steps without hitting a wall.

## Step 6: Determine the new player position
Since we choose to move left, our new coordinates would be (4, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{4, 3}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position (P)
The current player position (P) is at the coordinates (4, 2).

## Step 2: Identify the goal position (G)
The goal position (G) is at the coordinates (2, 3).

## Step 3: Examine the adjacent positions to the current player position (P)
The adjacent positions to the current player position (P) at (4, 2) are (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), and (5, 3). We can ignore (5, 2), (5, 3), and any position outside the maze or directly blocked by a wall.

## Step 4: Filter out positions that are walls (1) or outside the maze boundaries
Position (3, 2) has a wall, (5, 1), (5, 2), and (5, 3) are outside or would require moving further away or into a wall. Position (3, 1) has a wall and isn't viable for a direct path, position (4, 3) is available and closer to the goal but was blocked in the real maze by my own error in consideration previously, yet still is the viable path. Since (4, 3) appears blocked by our previous considerations due to an error in representation, (4, 1) is the correct consideration for the actual maze state presented and avoids previously overlooked blocking walls in the real path to goal.

## Step 5: Choose the most direct path to the goal position (G)
Given the corrected available options, moving up is not an option but moving left to (4, 1) gets closer to navigating towards the goal position (G).

## Step 6: Determine the new player position
The new coordinates, going left from (4, 2), would indeed be (4, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{4, 1}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Upon examining the original maze, it appears the empty spaces form a path that generally resembles an "L" shape, allowing navigation from P to G.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze that meets the specified criteria.
The new maze should have the same size as the original (5x5), include a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, not be an identical copy of the original, and its empty spaces should form an "L" shape.

## Step 3: Design the new maze.
To achieve this, we start by placing the "P" and "G" in new positions but still aim to form an "L" shape with the empty spaces. We ensure there is a path from P to G and maintain the maze's original size.

## Step 4: Construct the new maze.
Given the constraints and the goal of forming an "L" shape, here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 G
1 P 1 1 1

The final answer is: 
There is no final numerical answer for this problem as it asks for a descriptive response and a new maze construction.
