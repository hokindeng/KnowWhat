You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Current player position (P) is at the bottom right corner of the maze, and the goal position (G) is at the third row from the top. 

After analyzing the maze, I see that I can move the player up and to the left. Since I can move diagonally, I can go up and to the left at the same time.

The coordinates of the new position will be (3,3). 

The reasoning behind this move is that I am trying to get closer to the goal position (G) while avoiding walls. Moving up and to the left gets me closer to the goal and does not block my path for future moves. 

Please update the maze with my new position, and I will analyze it again to determine my next move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a " zigzag" or more specifically a "staircase shape". 

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size as the original, and with empty spaces that form the same staircase shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 G
1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 P

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and its corridors form a staircase shape. Note that the staircase shape in this new maze is flipped and slightly shifted compared to the original, but it is still recognizable as a staircase shape.
