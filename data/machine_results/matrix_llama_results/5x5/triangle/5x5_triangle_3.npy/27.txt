You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position (P)
The current player position (P) is at the coordinates (4, 4).

## Step 2: Identify the goal position (G)
The goal position (G) is at the coordinates (2, 3).

## Step 3: Examine the adjacent positions to the current player position
We can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position. The adjacent positions to (4, 4) are:
- Up: (3, 4) which is an empty space (0)
- Up-left: (3, 3) which is a wall (1)
- Left: (4, 3) which is a wall (1)
- Down-left: Out of bounds
- Down: Out of bounds
- Down-right: Out of bounds
- Right: Out of bounds
- Up-right: (3, 5) which is out of bounds

## Step 4: Choose the best adjacent position to move to
Considering the available options, the best move would be to the position up from the current position, (3, 4), because it moves closer to the goal (G) without hitting a wall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3 4}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 P
1 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position (P)
The current player position (P) is at the coordinates (3, 3).

## Step 2: Examine the adjacent positions to the current player position
We can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position. The adjacent positions to (3, 3) are:
- Up: (2, 3) which is a wall (1)
- Up-left: (2, 2) which is a wall (1)
- Left: (3, 2) which is a wall (1)
- Down-left: (4, 2) which is an empty space (0)
- Down: (4, 3) which is a wall (1)
- Down-right: (4, 4) which is an empty space (0)
- Right: (3, 4) which is the previous position and is an empty space (0) but moving there would not progress towards the goal.
- Up-right: (2, 4) which is an empty space (0) next to the goal.

## Step 3: Choose the best adjacent position to move to
Considering the available options and the need to progress towards the goal (G), the best move would be to the position up-right from the current position, (2, 4), because it places the player next to the goal without hitting a wall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2 4}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G P
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position (P)
The current player position (P) is at the coordinates (2, 4).

## Step 2: Identify the goal position (G)
The goal position (G) is at the coordinates (2, 3), directly left of the player's current position.

## Step 3: Examine the adjacent positions to the current player position
Given the goal's position directly left of the player, the only move to consider is moving left to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the best adjacent position to move to
The best and only meaningful move is to the position left from the current position, (2, 3), which is the goal position (G).

The final answer is: $\boxed{2 3}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Upon examination of the original maze and its solution path, it can be observed that the empty spaces form a general shape that resembles a zigzag or an "L" shape with an additional arm extending towards the starting point. However, given the constraints of movement (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) and the specific arrangement of the maze, the path taken from P to G could be best described as forming an "L" shape with the corner of the "L" being at the goal position (G). Therefore, the general shape formed by the empty spaces could be simplified to an "L" shape for the purposes of this task.

## Step 2: Create a new maze that meets the specified criteria.
To create a new maze that has the same size as the original (5x5), includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and has empty spaces forming a recognizable "L" shape, we must carefully consider the placement of walls (1), empty spaces (0), the player position (P), and the goal position (G).

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 0 1

This maze maintains the "L" shape formed by the empty spaces, is of the same size as the original, offers a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze.

The final answer is:

1. L shape
2. 
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 0 1
