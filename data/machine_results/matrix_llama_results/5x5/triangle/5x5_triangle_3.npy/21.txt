You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Current player position (P) is at the bottom right corner of the maze, and the goal (G) is two rows above and two columns to the left of the current position.

For my next move, I want to move closer to the goal without hitting a wall. I can move diagonally up and to the left. 

My next move will be to the coordinates (4, 2) -> (3, 1) is blocked by a wall, but (3,2) or (3,3) are not available so I will move to (4,3).

So, my next move is (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved to (4, 3), my next goal is to get closer to the goal (G) while avoiding the walls. I can see that if I move diagonally up and to the left again, I can reach the row where the goal is.

My next move will be to the coordinates (3, 2).

So, my next move is (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 P 1 0
1 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've made it to the row where the goal (G) is located. Now, I just need to move horizontally to the left to reach the goal.

However, the goal is blocked by a wall to its left. So, I need to find an alternative path to reach the goal. Since I can move diagonally, I can move up and to the left to reach the goal.

My next move will be to the coordinates (2, 3).

So, my next move is (2, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as an "L" shape, with a diagonal section connecting the vertical and horizontal parts.

Here is a new maze with the same size (5x5) and the same "L" shape formed by its empty spaces:


1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0
1 1 G 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 P 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar "L" shape, with a diagonal section connecting the vertical and horizontal parts. The maze has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through the empty spaces. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it has the same general shape and size.
