You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

Current player position (P) is at the bottom right corner of the maze, and the goal (G) is 3 spaces up and 2 spaces left. My first move will be to move up to the adjacent empty space.

My next move is to the coordinates (4, 3). 

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved up, I'll analyze the situation and plan my next move.

My goal is to move up and left to get closer to the goal (G). I'll move diagonally up and left to the adjacent empty space.

My next move is to the coordinates (3, 2).

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 P 1 0
1 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved diagonally up and left. Now I'll try to get closer to the goal.

Since there's a wall to my left and above me, I'll try to move up and right, to get adjacent to the goal (G). I'll move diagonally up and right.

My next move is to the coordinates (2, 3).

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "bent L-shape" or a "zigzag stair" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag stair shape:


1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0
1 1 0 1 G
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0


This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form a zigzag stair shape, similar to the original maze.
