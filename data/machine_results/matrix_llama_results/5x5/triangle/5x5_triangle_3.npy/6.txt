You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position (4, 4), marked by 'P'. My goal is to reach position (2, 3), marked by 'G'. To get closer to my goal, I will move to position (3, 4). This position is adjacent to my current position and is an empty space, making it a valid move.

My next move is to coordinates (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 P
1 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

I am currently at position (3, 3), marked by 'P'. My goal is still to reach position (2, 3), marked by 'G'. To get closer to my goal, I will move to position (3, 2). This position is adjacent to my current position and is an empty space, making it a valid move.

My next move is to coordinates (3, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is an "L" shape, as there is a vertical path from the bottom to the middle row and then a horizontal path from the middle row to the goal.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size, where the empty spaces form an "L" shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 P 0 1 1

This new maze has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and its corridors form an "L" shape, similar to the original maze. However, it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
