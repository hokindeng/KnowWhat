You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position (P)
The current player position (P) is at the coordinates (4, 4).

## Step 2: Identify the goal position (G)
The goal position (G) is at the coordinates (2, 3).

## Step 3: Examine the adjacent positions to the current player position
We can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position. The adjacent positions to (4, 4) are:
- Up: (3, 4) which is an empty space (0)
- Up-left: (3, 3) which is a wall (1)
- Left: (4, 3) which is a wall (1)
- Down-left: Out of bounds
- Down: Out of bounds
- Down-right: Out of bounds
- Right: Out of bounds
- Up-right: (3, 5) which is out of bounds

## Step 4: Choose the best adjacent position to move to
Considering the available options, the best move would be to the position up from the current position, (3, 4), because it moves closer to the goal (G) without hitting a wall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3 4}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 G 0
1 1 0 1 P
1 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position (P)
The current player position (P) is at the coordinates (3, 3).

## Step 2: Examine the adjacent positions to the current player position
We can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position. The adjacent positions to (3, 3) are:
- Up: (2, 3) which is a wall (1)
- Up-left: (2, 2) which is a wall (1)
- Left: (3, 2) which is an empty space (0)
- Down-left: (4, 2) which is an empty space (0)
- Down: (4, 3) which is an empty space (0)
- Down-right: (4, 4) which is an empty space (0)
- Right: (3, 4) which is a wall (1)
- Up-right: (2, 4) which is a goal (G)

## Step 3: Choose the best adjacent position to move to
Considering the available options, the best move would be to the position up-right from the current position, (2, 4), because it directly reaches the goal (G).

However, due to the rules of movement (can only move to empty spaces) and upon reviewing, a correction is needed: The best move is to move left to (3, 2) to create the possibility of reaching the goal through subsequent moves, as moving directly to the goal is not possible due to the presence of a wall that blocks the necessary diagonal path.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3 2}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
Upon examining the original maze, the empty spaces form a path that resembles an 'L' shape, allowing movement from the start position (P) to the goal position (G).

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and a valid path from P to G, where the empty spaces form the same general shape
To create a new maze, we need to maintain the 'L' shape of the path while rearranging the walls, start position, and goal position.

## Step 3: Design the new maze
Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 1

This maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G. The path formed by the empty spaces maintains an 'L' shape but is not an identical copy of the original maze.

The final answer is: 
Name of the general shape: L
New Maze:
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 1
