You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position (P) and the goal position (G)
The goal position (G) is located at (2,0), and the current player position (P) is at (2,2).

## Step 2: Evaluate possible moves from the current position
Given that we can move up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, we need to consider which of these moves are valid (i.e., they do not lead us into a wall or out of the maze).

## Step 3: Assess the immediate surroundings of the current position
Looking at the position (2,2), we see that moving up or down is blocked by walls. The only potential moves could be left, right, or diagonals that do not hit a wall or move out of the maze.

## Step 4: Choose the best next move
Since the goal is to the left and slightly up from the current position, and direct up movement is blocked, the best next move would be to move diagonally up and left, towards the goal. This means the coordinates of our next move should be one position left and one position up from (2,2), which is (2-1, 2-1) or (1, 1). However, we should ensure that we're moving into an empty space.

## Step 5: Confirm the chosen move leads to an empty space
Given the constraints of the maze and its current state, we see that moving diagonally up-left from (2,2) to (1,1) actually leads to a position that is outside of the empty spaces directly accessible from 'P'. This step was theoretically considered without properly accounting for the maze's current state. Re-evaluating, since moving up or down is blocked and moving directly left is the objective to get closer to the goal, but considering we cannot go through walls and all positions indirectly around P are blocked by walls except for the ones directly adjacent which allow movement towards the goal, a reevaluation of direct moves shows that directly moving left is the correct step as it brings us closer to the goal through an empty space.

## Step 6: Identify the correct coordinates for the move left
Moving left from (2,2) means the new coordinates will be (2,1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  1\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a path that can be traversed from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). The general shape of this path resembles an "L" shape because it moves primarily in two directions (down and then left or vice versa) with some minor variations to navigate around walls.

## Step 2: Confirm the identification of the shape
Upon closer inspection, while the path involves movements in different directions due to the layout of walls and empty spaces, the overall pattern or shape that allows navigation from P to G can indeed be simplified to an "L" shape, considering the primary directions of movement required to solve the maze.

## Step 3: Create a new maze of the same size with the same general shape of empty spaces
Given the original maze's size (5x5) and the identified "L" shape of its path, we need to generate a new maze that maintains the "L" shape for its empty spaces, ensures there's a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze.

## Step 4: Design the new maze
To create a new maze that satisfies all the criteria, we'll place the goal (G) at a different location but ensure that the path from P to G still forms an "L" shape. One way to do this is by placing the goal at the bottom-right corner and adjusting the walls and empty spaces to form an "L" path from the top-left to the bottom-right. However, to maintain consistency with the task and ensure the maze's solvability, we will keep the general "L" shape concept but adjust the layout to fit within the given constraints and requirements.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze
Given the constraints and requirements, here's an example of a new maze that meets the criteria, maintaining an "L" shaped path for the empty spaces:


0 1 1 1 1
P 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 G

This maze is not an identical copy of the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and the path forms a general "L" shape adapted to fit the maze's dimensions and the movement constraints.

The final answer is:

 "{ 
Shape: L shape
Maze:
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 G
}"
