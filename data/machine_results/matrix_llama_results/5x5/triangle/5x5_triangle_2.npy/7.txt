You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves step-by-step to reach the goal 'G' from the player position 'P'.

The initial maze is:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (2, 2) because the top-left corner is (0, 0), and we count the rows and columns starting from 0.

To move closer to 'G', which is at coordinates (2, 0), I need to move left.

My next move will be to the position at coordinates (2, 1) to start moving towards 'G'.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (2, 1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the maze is a "Cross" or could be seen as including parts of a rectangle or rectangle-like shape with extensions leading outwards from it. The dominant recognizable pattern particularly when focusing on paths from P to G that these spaces create, essentially allowing movement in a manner resembling that shape.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size, with the corridors forming a similar "Cross" or rectangle-like shape. This new maze will maintain the same format and rules but will not be an identical copy of the original.

0 0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 0
0 1 1 0 1
0 0 1 1 0

In this new maze, the goal 'G' is still at (2, 0), and the player 'P' is at (2, 2). The maze is designed to allow movement in a similar pattern to the original but with some variations to make it distinct.
