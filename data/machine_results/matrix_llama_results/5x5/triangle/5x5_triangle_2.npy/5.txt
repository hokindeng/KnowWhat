You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves step-by-step to reach the goal 'G' from the player position 'P'.

The initial maze is:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (2, 2), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (2, 0).

For my first move, I will move diagonally up-left to the empty space at coordinates (1, 1).

However, this space is occupied by a wall (1). So, I'll consider alternative moves. The closest empty spaces adjacent to 'P' are at (2, 1) or (3, 2). Since I need to move closer to 'G', which is at (2, 0), I will choose to move left to (2, 1).

My next move will be to the coordinates (2, 1).

Please update the maze according to this move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a diagonal zig-zag corridor.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size (5x5) that meets the specified criteria, with empty spaces forming a diagonal zig-zag corridor:

0 1 0 0 1
0 0 1 1 0
G 1 0 P 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 0

This maze includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces and has the same diagonal zig-zag corridor shape. Note that it's not an identical copy of the original maze.
