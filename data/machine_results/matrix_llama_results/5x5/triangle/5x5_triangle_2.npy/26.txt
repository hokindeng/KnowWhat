You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves step-by-step to reach the goal 'G' from the player position 'P'.

The initial maze is:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

First, I will analyze the possible moves from the current position 'P', which is at coordinates (2, 2). 

Available moves:
- Up (2, 1) is blocked by a wall
- Down (2, 3) is blocked by a wall
- Left (1, 2) is blocked by a wall
- Right (3, 2) is an empty space
- Diagonal up-left (1, 1) is blocked by a wall
- Diagonal up-right (3, 1) is not considered because moving diagonally through the wall does not lead directly to an empty space
- Diagonal down-left (1, 3) is blocked by a wall
- Diagonal down-right (3, 3) is blocked by a wall

Considering these options, my next move would be to the coordinates (2, 2) -> (3, 2).

However, upon reviewing the given format and instructions again, I realized that I'm supposed to follow a specific format that only allows one final answer at the end of the response. Given this constraint and to comply with the format, I'll need to simplify my explanation to focus directly on that answer.

Given the constraints and focusing strictly on the requested format for an answer:

My next move is to (2, 1) no, wait - I made a mistake. I need to put my answer in this specific format for you.
My next move is G,1.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a diagonal line connecting the corners, intersecting with a nearly complete rectangular border around the maze edges.

However, focusing on a simpler general description fitting within the context:

The general shape can be simplified as an "Elongated Diagonal."

(2) Here is a new maze that fits the criteria:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 G
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 0

This new maze has the same size as the original (5x5), is not an identical copy of the original, and includes a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces can be described similarly as an elongated diagonal line or pathway.
