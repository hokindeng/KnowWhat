You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'd be happy to help solve the maze.

Based on the initial maze, I see that I'm starting at the position marked 'P' which is at coordinates (2,2). My goal is to reach the position marked 'G' which is at coordinates (2,0).

Considering the available empty spaces and walls around me, my next move will be to move diagonally up-left to the position at coordinates (1,1).

Please update the maze accordingly, and I'll provide the next move based on the updated maze. 

Next move coordinates: (1,1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a zigzag shape or more specifically an "L" or bent shape that connects the start to the goal.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size as the original maze (5x5). It has a valid path from 'P' to 'G' through empty spaces, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is a similar zigzag or bent shape.


0 0 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 1
1 P 1 0 G
1 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0


This new maze maintains the same zigzag or bent shape in its empty spaces as the original while presenting a different path from 'P' to 'G'.
