You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at coordinates (2,2) and the goal is at (2,0).

Since I can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonal) to an adjacent empty space, I'll plan my move to get closer to the goal. My next move will be to the position up and left of the current position, trying to move around the walls.

My next move will be to coordinates (2,1) and then (1,1) but the position (1,1) is blocked by a wall, so I will go directly to (1,2) no, it is blocked too. Let me go to (2,3) no, blocked, to (3,2), yes it is a valid move.

The coordinates of my next move are (3,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a winding or irregular path with some regions enclosed by walls and one larger corridor connecting the start position P to the goal G in a somewhat indirect fashion. However, upon closer inspection, it appears the corridors somewhat resemble the shape of a "zigzag" or a winding path from top-right to bottom-left of the maze, avoiding obstacles.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size that also encodes a zigzag or winding path from P to G:


0 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
0 0 G 1 1
1 1 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 0

This new maze is not an identical copy of the original, yet it retains a zigzag or winding path formed by its empty spaces, providing a valid route from P to G while maintaining a similar level of complexity.
