You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will plan my moves step-by-step to reach the goal 'G' from the player position 'P'.

The initial maze is:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (2, 2), and the goal 'G' is at coordinates (2, 0).

For my next move, I plan to move diagonally up-left to the empty space at coordinates (1, 1). However, this is not possible as it's blocked by a wall. 

So, my next best move is to go left to the empty space at coordinates (2, 1), but it's also blocked by a wall.

Therefore, my next move would be to go up to the empty space at coordinates (1, 2), but it's also blocked.

Hence, my next move will be to the coordinates (2, 3) is not a good move because it is blocked and (3, 2) is my next move.

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a "T-shape" or a "T-like" structure, where the main vertical path splits into two horizontal branches, one short and the other longer.

Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a similar T-shape:

0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 1 1
G 1 1 P 0
0 1 0 0 1
0 0 1 1 1

This new maze meets the required criteria: it has the same size, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by the empty spaces is recognizable as a T-shape, where the main vertical path splits into two horizontal branches.
