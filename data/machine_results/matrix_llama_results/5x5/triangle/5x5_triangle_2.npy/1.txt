You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at coordinates (2,2) and the goal is at (2,0).

Since I can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonal) to an adjacent empty space, I'll plan my move to get closer to the goal. My next move will be to the position up and left from the current position, as it's the most direct path towards the goal.

The coordinates of my next move will be (2,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a diagonal corridor from the top left to the bottom right.

However, a closer inspection reveals a larger shape. The empty spaces form a roughly "\\" (backslash) shape or a "Reverse L" shape overall, but it can be generalized as an "L" shape, if rotated.


(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and an "L" shape corridor:


G 1 1 1 0
0 0 1 0 0
0 1 0 1 P
1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1


Note that while the original maze had a specific configuration of walls and corridors, the "L" shape of the corridors is maintained in the new maze, although it is not an exact replica. The new maze has a valid path from P to G, and its corridors form a recognizable "L" shape, rotated from the original.
