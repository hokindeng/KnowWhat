You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position (P) is at coordinates (2,2).

Since we can move to any adjacent empty space (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), I will examine the options:

* Up and left: (1,1) is a wall (1), so this is not a valid move.
* Up: (1,2) is a wall (1), so this is not a valid move.
* Up and right: (1,3) is an empty space (0), but it's not the best option, as it will put us in a corner.
* Right: (2,3) is a wall (1), so this is not a valid move.
* Down and right: (3,3) is a wall (1), so this is not a valid move.
* Down: (3,2) is an empty space (0), which is a valid move.
* Down and left: (3,1) is an empty space (0), which is a valid move, but it's not the best option, as it will move us away from the goal (G).
* Left: (2,1) is a wall (1), so this is not a valid move.

Considering the options, I decide to move down to the empty space at coordinates (3,2). This move gets us closer to the goal (G) and sets up potential future moves.

My next move is to (3,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "Inverted L" shape, connecting the top and left side of the maze to the bottom and right side through a corner.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and an "Inverted L" shape formed by the empty spaces:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 1
G 0 1 P 1
0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 0

This maze meets the criteria:

* It has the same size as the original maze (5x5).
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces.
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze.
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an "Inverted L" shape.
