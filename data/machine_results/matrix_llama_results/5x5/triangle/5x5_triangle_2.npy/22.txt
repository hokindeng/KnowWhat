You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at coordinates (2,2) and the goal position is at coordinates (2,0).

To move closer to the goal, I will move diagonally up-left from the current position (2,2) to position (1,1). However, since there's a wall at (1,1), this move is not possible.

Instead, I will move up from the current position (2,2) to position (2,1). However, there's also a wall at (2,1).

I will move left from the current position (2,2) to position (2,1) is not possible, so I will move to (2,1) is not possible, so I will move to the position (3 is not a valid option, 1). I will move to position (1,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

0 1 1 0 0
0 1 P 0 1
G 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form an L-shape, but the walls and corridors have been rearranged to create a different path from P to G.
