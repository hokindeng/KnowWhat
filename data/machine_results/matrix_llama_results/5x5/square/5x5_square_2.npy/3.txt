You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (3, 2), and the goal position is (0, 2). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Looking around the current position:
- Up: (2, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move up.
- Down: (4, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (3, 1) is an empty space, so I can move left.
- Right: (3, 3) is an empty space, so I can move right.

Considering the options, I will choose to move left to (3, 1), as it might bring me closer to the goal or create more opportunities for future moves.

My next move is to (3, 1). Please update the maze accordingly.

Please respond with the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (3, 1), and the goal position is (0, 2). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Looking around the current position:
- Up: (2, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move up.
- Down: (4, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (3, 0) is a wall, so I cannot move left.
- Right: (3, 2) is an empty space that I previously occupied, and moving right would not bring me closer to the goal.

However, I can move up and left is not possible from my current position, I can try going around by moving right then up. 

My next move is to (3, 2), which I had previously occupied. I am doing this to reassess and see any potential moves I can make from this position or try to move up.

My next move is to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (3, 2), and the goal position is (0, 2). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Looking around the current position:
- Up: (2, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move up directly. However, I notice that (2, 1) has a wall, but (2, 0) is empty. If I can move to (3, 0) I would be unable to, but there is another empty space at (3, 1) adjacent to my current position.
- Down: (4, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (3, 1) is an empty space, so I can move left.
- Right: (3, 3) is an empty space, so I can move right.

Considering my options, I will choose to move left to (3, 1). The goal is to reach (2, 0), potentially allowing a path up.

My next move is to (3, 1) then most likely I can work to a move that will allow me to get past the wall at Y: 2

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (3, 1), and the goal position is (0, 2). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Looking around the current position:
- Up: (2, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move up.
- Down: (4, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (3, 0) is a wall, so I cannot move left.
- Right: (3, 2) is an empty space, so I can move right, but I've been there before.

However, I can try to find a new path by moving further right and then potentially up.

My next move is to (3, 3) in an attempt to navigate around the wall and move up the left side.

My next move is to (3, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "Zig-Zag" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "Zig-Zag" shape:


1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

This new maze meets the criteria, with a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and the general shape of the corridors forming a "Zig-Zag" shape.
