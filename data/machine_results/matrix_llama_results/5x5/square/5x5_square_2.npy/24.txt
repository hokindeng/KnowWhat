You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (3,2), marked by 'P'. To navigate to the goal position 'G', I will explore the possible moves from the current position.

Upon examining the maze, I notice that moving up from the current position is blocked by a wall. However, moving down is also not an option as there is a wall below. I can move left to the empty space at (3,1) or move right to the empty space at (3,3).

My next move will be to move right to the empty space at (3,3), as it appears to be a more open path. The coordinates of my next move are (3,3).

Please let me know the outcome of this move and present the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (3,3), marked by 'P'. To navigate to the goal position 'G', I will explore the possible moves from the current position.

Upon examining the maze, I notice that moving right from the current position is blocked by a wall, and moving down is also not an option as there is a wall below. I can move left to the empty space at (3,2), move up to the empty space at (2,3), or move left to the empty space at (3,2) and then potentially up.

However, moving up seems like the most promising direction. Therefore, my next move will be to move up to the empty space that isn't there (at (2,3) there is a '1') at (2,2). No, that isn't right.

My next move will be to move left to the empty space at (3,2). The coordinates of my next move are (3,2).

Please let me know the outcome of this move and present the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Back to the previous position!

The current player position is at (3,2), marked by 'P'. To navigate to the goal position 'G', I will explore the possible moves from the current position.

Upon examining the maze, I notice that moving up from the current position is blocked by a wall. However, I can move left to the empty space at (3,1) or move right to the empty space at (3,3), which I've already visited before. I can also move up is blocked, but there may be another way to get around this.

Moving left seems like a good option, as it might allow me to find a path around the wall blocking the goal. My next move will be to move left to the empty space at (3,1). The coordinates of my next move are (3,1).

Please let me know the outcome of this move and present the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Progress!

The current player position is at (3,1), marked by 'P'. To navigate to the goal position 'G', I will explore the possible moves from the current position.

Upon examining the maze, I notice that moving left from the current position is blocked by a wall. Moving right would take me back to the previous position, and moving down is also blocked by a wall. However, moving up to the empty space at (2,1) looks promising, as it might allow me to find a path to the goal.

My next move will be to move up to the empty space at (2,1). The coordinates of my next move are (2,1).

Please let me know the outcome of this move and present the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current player position is at (2,1), marked by 'P'. To navigate to the goal position 'G', I will explore the possible moves from the current position.

Upon examining the maze, I notice that moving right from the current position is blocked by a wall. Moving down would take me back to the previous position, and moving left is also blocked by a wall. However, moving up to the empty space at (1,1) looks promising, as it might allow me to find a path to the goal.

My next move will be to move up to the empty space at (1,1). The coordinates of my next move are (1,1).

Please let me know the outcome of this move and present the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Almost there!

The current player position is at (1,1), marked by 'P'. To navigate to the goal position 'G', I will explore the possible moves from the current position.

Upon examining the maze, I notice that moving up from the current position is blocked by a wall that isn't there, the actual top wall of the maze is right there so I can't move up. However, I can move left to the empty space at (1,0). That actually leads to the goal.

My next move will be to move left to the empty space at (1,0). The coordinates of my next move are (1,0).

Please let me know the outcome of this move and present the updated maze.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L" shape.

The "L" shape is formed by the empty spaces in the original maze, which provide a path from the starting point "P" to the goal point "G".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 G
1 1 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original, and it includes a valid path from "P" to "G" that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is also recognizable as an "L" shape. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it shares the same underlying structure.
