You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (3, 2), and the goal position is (0, 2). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Available moves from the current position (3, 2):

- Up: (2, 2) is a wall (1), so this move is not possible.
- Down: (4, 2) is a wall (1), so this move is not possible.
- Left: (3, 1) is an empty space (0), so this move is possible.
- Right: (3, 3) is an empty space (0), so this move is possible.

Since I need to move closer to the goal, I will choose the right move, as it does not block the path to the goal and provides an opportunity to explore further.

My next move will be to the right, to the coordinates (3, 3).

Please update the maze with the new player position, and I'll analyze the new situation for the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the new situation.

The current player position is (3, 3), and the goal position is (0, 2). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Available moves from the current position (3, 3):

- Up: (2, 3) is a wall (1), so this move is not possible.
- Down: (4, 3) is a wall (1), so this move is not possible.
- Left: (3, 2) is an empty space (0), so this move is possible, but it would be moving back to the previous position.
- Right: (3, 4) is an empty space (0), so this move is possible.

Since I need to move closer to the goal, I will choose the right move, as it does not block the path to the goal and provides an opportunity to explore further.

However, I also notice that moving right might lead to a dead end. I need to be careful and plan ahead.

After re-evaluating the situation, I realize that moving left and then up might provide a better path to the goal. But the immediate up move from (3, 2) is blocked by a wall.

Considering the options carefully, my next move will be to the left, to the coordinates (3, 2). I will try to find an alternative path from this position.

Please update the maze with the new player position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back to the previous position.

The current player position is (3, 2), and the goal position is (0, 2). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Available moves from the current position (3, 2):

- Up: (2, 2) is a wall (1), so this move is not possible.
- Down: (4, 2) is a wall (1), so this move is not possible.
- Left: (3, 1) is an empty space (0), so this move is possible.
- Right: (3, 3) is an empty space (0), but I already explored this path and decided to return to the current position.

My next move will be to the left, to the coordinates (3, 1). This move will allow me to explore a new path and potentially find a way up to the goal.

Please update the maze with the new player position.

- Left: (3, 0) is a wall (1), so this move is not possible.
- Right: (3, 2) is an empty space (0), which I previously explored.

My next move will be to the up, to the coordinates (2, 1). This move will allow me to move closer to the goal and potentially find a way to reach it.

My next move will be to the up, to the coordinates (0, 1). This move will allow me to move closer to the goal and potentially find a way to reach it.

Please update the maze with the new player position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 P G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the new situation.

The current player position is (0, 1), and the goal position is (0, 2). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Available moves from the current position (0, 1):

- Up: Not applicable, as I'm already at the top row.
- Down: (1, 1) is an empty space (0), but it moves away from the goal.
- Left: Not applicable, as I'm already at the leftmost column of the maze that has accessible spaces.
- Right: (0, 2) is the goal position (G), so this move is the final step.

My next move will be to the right, to the coordinates (0, 2), which is the goal position.

This move should complete the maze, and I should have successfully reached the goal!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L-shape" or an "L-path", since the empty spaces form an L-like structure that connects the starting point (P) to the goal (G).

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 P 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form an L-shape, connecting the starting point (P) to the goal (G). However, the wall layout is different from the original maze, making it a new and distinct puzzle.
