You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (3, 2), as indicated by 'P'.

After examining the maze, I notice that there's only one possible direction to move from the current position without hitting a wall, which is moving right to the empty space at (3, 3).

Therefore, my next move is to (3, 3).

Please update the maze and provide the new representation so I can plan the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (3, 3), as indicated by 'P'.

From this position, I have two possible directions to move without hitting a wall: moving up to (2, 3) or moving right to (3, 4). However, since moving right would put me in a corner, I'll choose to move up to (2, 3) to maintain more options for future moves.

Therefore, my next move is to (2, 3) but that is not possible since there is a wall at (2, 3), I will move right to (3, 4).

My next move is to (3, 4).

Please update the maze and provide the new representation so I can plan the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (3, 4), as indicated by 'P'.

From this position, I can only move up, since the other directions are blocked by walls or out of bounds. However, I notice that the column directly above me has a wall at (2, 4) and (1, 4), but the column to the left of that has empty spaces leading to the goal.

So, I will move left to (3, 3), then try to find a path up.

My next move is to (3, 3).

Please update the maze and provide the new representation so I can plan the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Back to this position.

The current player position is (3, 3), as indicated by 'P'.

From this position, I'll move up to (2, 3), but that's not possible since there is a wall at (2, 3). My next best option would be to move left to (3, 2), which will give me a chance to move up later.

My next move is to (3, 2).

Please update the maze and provide the new representation so I can plan the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current player position is (3, 2), as indicated by 'P'.

From this position, I can try to move up, which has been blocked so far by the wall at (2, 3) or the wall at (2, 2) that is in the line above the current position and a space to the left of it, I should move left to (3, 1).

My next move is to (3, 1).

Please update the maze and provide the new representation so I can plan the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current player position is (3, 1), as indicated by 'P'.

From this position, I can finally move up to (2, 1), which seems like a good direction to make progress towards the goal.

My next move is to (2, 1).

Please update the maze and provide the new representation so I can plan the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current player position is (2, 1), as indicated by 'P'.

From this position, I can see that moving up will get me closer to the goal, but I'll need to move left first to access the column with the goal.

My next move is to (2, 0) then move up from there, but for now.

My next move is to (2, 0).

Please update the maze and provide the new representation so I can plan the next step.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "Z-Shape" or "S-Shape" (a combination of horizontal and vertical paths that form a zigzag or S-like shape)

Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same shape:

1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 0
1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

This new maze meets the criteria:

* Same size as the original maze
* Includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* Not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as a "Z-Shape" or "S-Shape"

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
