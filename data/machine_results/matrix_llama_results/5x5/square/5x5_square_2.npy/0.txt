You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (3, 2), and the goal position is (0, 2). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Looking around the current position:
- Up: (2, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move up.
- Down: (4, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (3, 1) is an empty space, so I can move left.
- Right: (3, 3) is an empty space, so I can move right.

Since I want to get closer to the goal position, I will choose to move left to (3, 1) because it seems like a more promising direction.

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (3, 1), and the goal position is still (0, 2).

Looking around the current position:
- Up: (2, 1) is an empty space, so I can move up.
- Down: (4, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (3, 0) is a wall, so I cannot move left.
- Right: (3, 2) is an empty space, so I can move right.

Since I want to get closer to the goal position, I will choose to move up to (2, 1) because it seems like a more promising direction.

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (2, 1), and the goal position is still (0, 2).

Looking around the current position:
- Up: (1, 1) is an empty space, so I can move up.
- Down: (3, 1) is an empty space, but I just came from there, so I'll avoid moving down for now.
- Left: (2, 0) is a wall, so I cannot move left.
- Right: (2, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move right.

Since I want to get closer to the goal position, I will choose to move up to (1, 1) because it seems like a more promising direction.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (1, 1), and the goal position is still (0, 2).

Looking around the current position:
- Up: (0, 1) is an empty space, so I can move up.
- Down: (2, 1) is an empty space, but I just came from there, so I'll avoid moving down for now.
- Left: (1, 0) is a wall, so I cannot move left.
- Right: (1, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move right.

Since I want to get closer to the goal position, I will choose to move up to (0, 1) because it seems like a more promising direction, and I can then try to move right to reach the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 P G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm close to the goal!

The current player position is (0, 1), and the goal position is right next to me, at (0, 2).

Looking around the current position:
- I can see the goal position directly to my right.

I will simply move right to (0, 2) to reach the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, where the empty spaces form the same L-shape:

1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 0 G
