You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'd be happy to help solve the maze.

Based on the initial maze, I see that the current player position 'P' is at coordinates (3, 2).

To start, I will examine the adjacent cells. Since I can move up, down, left, or right, the possible moves are:

- Up: (2, 2) is a wall (1), so I cannot move there.
- Down: (4, 2) is a wall (1), so I cannot move there.
- Left: (3, 1) is an empty space (0), so I can move there.
- Right: (3, 3) is an empty space (0), so I can move there.

Considering the options, I will choose to move right to the empty space at (3, 3).

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 3).

Please update the maze and let me know the next state. I'll be happy to continue solving it!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I see that the current player position 'P' is at coordinates (3, 3).

I will again examine the adjacent cells:

- Up: (2, 3) is a wall (1), so I cannot move there.
- Down: (4, 3) is a wall (1), so I cannot move there.
- Left: (3, 2) is an empty space (0), so I can move there, but that would be going back to the previous position, so I won't consider that.
- Right: (3, 4) is an empty space (0), so I can move there.

Considering the options, I will choose to move right to the empty space at (3, 4).

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 4).

Please update the maze and let me know the next state!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I see that the current player position 'P' is at coordinates (3, 4).

I will examine the adjacent cells:

- Up: (2, 4) is a wall (1), so I cannot move there.
- Down: (4, 4) is a wall (1), so I cannot move there.
- Left: (3, 3) is an empty space (0), so I can move there, but that would be going back to the previous position, so I won't consider that.
- Since I'm at the rightmost edge of the maze, I don't have a right move option.

However, I notice that I can move left to the empty space at (3, 3) and then try to go up, or I can try to go up earlier in the maze by moving left twice. But for now, I will move left and then up.

First, I will choose to move left to the empty space at (3, 3).

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I see that the current player position 'P' is at coordinates (3, 2) no (3,3).

I will examine the adjacent cells:

- Up: (2, 3) is a wall (1), so I cannot move there directly.
- Down: (4, 3) is a wall (1), so I cannot move there.
- Left: (3, 2) is an empty space (0), that I have just come from (3,3).
- Right: (3, 4) is an empty space (0), which I have also been in.

However, I notice that the second column is mostly empty, so I will choose to move left twice to (3,1) then try to find my way up to the goal.

First, I will choose to move left to the empty space at (3, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 2), then (3, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) an "L-shape" or "90-degree angle" shape, as the corridors in the original maze form a distinctive L-shape.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it has the same size and an L-shaped corridor that allows for a valid path from P to G.
