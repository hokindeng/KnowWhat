You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (3,2) and the goal position is (0,2). To move closer to the goal, I will move up.

My next move will be to the position (2,2). However, this position is a wall (represented by '1'), so I will move up and to the left to position (2,1) which is an empty space.

My next move will be to (2,1) but then I will provide the corrected coordinates after rethinking. Since I am currently at (3,2), moving directly up is not an option due to the wall. I should move to an adjacent empty space. A better option is to move left to position (3,1).

The coordinates of my next move are (3,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm glad I was able to move left successfully. Now I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

Since I am at position (3,1) and my goal is to reach position (0,2), I need to move up. However, I still have a wall above me at position (2,1). I will move up is not an option. I should move to an adjacent empty space. A better option is to move up and to the left, but since I have a wall I will move up to the space adjacent to the wall at (2,0) isn't possible because I have a wall to my left, I will move right and then I will move up.

No, better I move right twice then move up. My next move will be the coordinates (3,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at position (3,2), my next move will be to move up and since I still have a wall I will move right to (3,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (3,3). My goal is still to reach position (0,2). Since I have empty spaces above me and to the right, and a wall to the left and below, my best option is to move right again to position (3,4). This will give me more flexibility to potentially move up in the future.

The coordinates of my next move are (3,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3,4), I notice that I have a clear path above me, so my next move will be to move up to position (2,4).

The coordinates of my next move are (2,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 P
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2,4). I still want to move up to get closer to the goal position. My next move will be to position (1,4).

The coordinates of my next move are (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 P
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1,4), I'm closer to the goal. However, I notice that there's a wall to my left, so I'll need to move to the left before I can reach the goal. But I also have a wall in the (1,4) and (1,3), so I will move to (1,2) isn't possible I will need to go to the 0,4 then move to 0,3 to move to 0,2.


My next move is to the (0,4) position.

The coordinates of my next move are (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 P
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,4), I'll move to the left to get closer to the goal.

My next move will be to position (0,3).

The coordinates of my next move are (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G P 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,3). To reach the goal position (0,2) which contains 'G', I will simply move one step to the left to position (0,2).

The coordinates of my next move are (0,2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "A Z-shaped or S-shaped curve".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

1 0 P 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 1

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and its empty spaces form a recognizable Z-shaped or S-shaped curve.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
