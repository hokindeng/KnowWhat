You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (3, 2), and the goal position is (0, 2). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Looking around the current position:
- Up: (2, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move up.
- Down: (4, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (3, 1) is an empty space, so I can move left.
- Right: (3, 3) is an empty space, so I can move right.

Since the goal position is above the current position and I want to move closer to it, I will prioritize moving left.

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (3, 1), and the goal position is (0, 2). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Looking around the current position:
- Up: (2, 1) is an empty space, so I can move up.
- Down: (4, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (3, 0) is a wall, so I cannot move left.
- Right: (3, 2) is an empty space that I previously occupied, and moving right would not bring me closer to the goal.

Since the goal position is above the current position and I want to move closer to it, I will prioritize moving up.

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (2, 1), and the goal position is (0, 2). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Looking around the current position:
- Up: (1, 1) is an empty space, so I can move up.
- Down: (3, 1) is an empty space that I previously occupied, and moving down would not bring me closer to the goal.
- Left: (2, 0) is a wall, so I cannot move left.
- Right: (2, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move right.

Since the goal position is above the current position and I want to move closer to it, I will prioritize moving up.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (1, 1), and the goal position is (0, 2). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Looking around the current position:
- Up: (0, 1) is an empty space, so I can move up.
- Down: (2, 1) is an empty space that I previously occupied, and moving down would not bring me closer to the goal.
- Left: (1, 0) is a wall, so I cannot move left.
- Right: (1, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move right, however the goal (0,2) is above and one position to the right from the current one (1,1), so moving up and then right seems like the best path forward.

Since the goal position is above the current position and slightly to the right, I will prioritize moving up.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 P G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm almost there!

With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (0, 1), and the goal position is (0, 2). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Looking around the current position:
- Up: Not possible, since I'm already at the top row.
- Down: (1, 1) is an empty space that I previously occupied, and moving down would not bring me closer to the goal.
- Left: (0, 0) is a wall, so I cannot move left.
- Right: (0, 2) is the goal position, so I can move right!

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 2)

This should be the final move to reach the goal!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L-shape" or "L-corridor"

The original maze had an L-shaped corridor that connected the starting point (P) to the goal point (G).

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 P 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape that connects the starting point (P) to the goal point (G). The L-shape is oriented differently than in the original maze, but it is still recognizable as an L-corridor.
