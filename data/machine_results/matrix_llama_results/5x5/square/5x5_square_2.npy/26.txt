You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (3, 2), and the goal position is (0, 2). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Looking around the current position:

- Up: (2, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move up.
- Down: (4, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (3, 1) is an empty space, so I can move left.
- Right: (3, 3) is an empty space, so I can move right.

Since I need to reach the goal at (0, 2), I should move in the general direction of up-left. Moving left at this point seems to be the best choice, as it might provide more opportunities to move up in the future.

I will choose to move left to (3, 1).

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (3, 1), and the goal position is still (0, 2).

Looking around the current position:

- Up: (2, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move up.
- Down: (4, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (3, 0) is a wall, so I cannot move left.
- Right: (3, 2) is an empty space, so I can move right.

However, I notice that moving right would put me back at the previous position. Instead, I should focus on finding a way to move up. Since I'm blocked by the wall above, I need to find a different route.

Let me re-examine the maze... Ah-ha! I see a potential path. If I move right twice, I can try to move up.

My next move will be to (3, 2), and then I can plan the next step from there.

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (3, 2), and the goal position is still (0, 2).

As I mentioned earlier, I plan to move right again to create an opportunity to move up. Looking at the maze:

- Right: (3, 3) is an empty space, so I can move right.

I will move right to (3, 3). This might give me a chance to find a path up.

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (3, 3), and the goal position is still (0, 2).

Now that I've moved right, I see a potential path up. However, I'm still blocked by the wall directly above me. I notice that I can move right again to (3, 4), but that wouldn't help me get closer to the goal.

Instead, I can try to move back left to (3, 2), but that wouldn't be a good move either. The best option seems to be to wait for now and move up when the opportunity arises.

Wait, I notice that I can move up if I move back one step to the left and then move up through the column at (1-3,2). However, there is another option which is much simpler, if I can just move back one step left and one step up isn't possible. I also can move back one step left twice and two steps up.

However I still look for other options such as move left two times after getting to top row. I can simply continue from where I was, by simply apply that scenario, my future possibility arises moving back twice left.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a zigzag staircase or, more formally, a stepped rectangular path with a series of connected segments at right angles.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a stepped rectangular path:

1 0 0 0 G
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 0
1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a stepped rectangular path that can be traversed from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G). The general shape is recognizable as a zigzag staircase or stepped rectangular path.
