You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (3,2), marked by 'P'. To navigate to the goal position 'G', I will explore the possible moves from the current position.

Upon examining the maze, I notice that moving up from the current position is blocked by a wall. However, moving down is also not an option as there is a wall below. I can move left to the empty space at (3,1) or move right to the empty space at (3,3).

My next move will be to move right to the empty space at (3,3), as it appears to be a more open path. The coordinates of my next move are (3,3).

Please let me know the outcome of this move and present the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (3,3), marked by 'P'. To navigate to the goal position 'G', I will explore the possible moves from the current position.

Upon examining the maze, I notice that moving right from the current position is an option, but it doesn't seem to lead towards the goal. Moving down is blocked by a wall. Moving up to the space at (2,3) is also blocked by a wall. However, moving left to the empty space at (3,2) is a possibility.

My next move will be to move left to the empty space at (3,2), as it appears to be the only viable option to potentially create a path to the goal. The coordinates of my next move are (3,2).

Please let me know the outcome of this move and present the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (3,2), marked by 'P'. To navigate to the goal position 'G', I will explore the possible moves from the current position.

Upon examining the maze, I notice that moving up from the current position is a possibility, as the space at (2,2) is empty. Moving left to the space at (3,1) is also an option. However, moving right or down are not viable options.

My next move will be to move up to the empty space at (2,2), as it appears to be the most promising path towards the goal. However, the space at (2,2) is actually blocked by a wall ('1'), so that's not an option.

My next move will be to move left to the empty space at (3,1). The coordinates of my next move are (3,1).

Please let me know the outcome of this move and present the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (3,1), marked by 'P'. To navigate to the goal position 'G', I will explore the possible moves from the current position.

Upon examining the maze, I notice that moving left from the current position is blocked by a wall. Moving down is also blocked by a wall. However, moving right to the space at (3,2) or moving up to the space at (2,1) are possibilities.

My next move will be to move up to the empty space at (2,1), as it appears to be a step closer to the goal. The coordinates of my next move are (2,1).

Please let me know the outcome of this move and present the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (2,1), marked by 'P'. To navigate to the goal position 'G', I will explore the possible moves from the current position.

Upon examining the maze, I notice that moving down from the current position is a possibility, but it would move me away from the goal. Moving right is blocked by a wall. However, moving up to the space at (1,1) or moving left are not options as there is a wall to the left and moving up would put me at the wall at (1,1) however there is a empty space to the left of (1,1) at (1,0) and one to the right (which contains the G (1,2)) so moving up then moving left is not the correct choice.

However moving left then moving up is still a valid move that could make progress towards the goal, I can move left from the current position to the empty space at (2,0), from there it will be closer to the goal. The coordinates of my next move are (2,0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "S-shape" or a winding path.

(2) Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:
```
1 0 0 0 1
1 G 1 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1
```
The empty spaces in this new maze also form an S-shape, and there is a valid path from P to G that can be reached through the empty spaces. The maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it shares the same general shape and size.
