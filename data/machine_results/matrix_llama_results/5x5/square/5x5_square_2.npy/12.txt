You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (3, 2), and the goal position is (0, 2). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Looking around the current position:
- Up: (2, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move up.
- Down: (4, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (3, 1) is an empty space, so I can move left.
- Right: (3, 3) is an empty space, so I can move right.

Since the goal position is above the current position and moving left or right does not directly lead to the goal, I should prepare to move up. However, the wall above the current position prevents me from doing so immediately. I can move left to (3, 1), which is an empty space and may potentially provide a path to the goal in the future.

Next move: (3, 1)

Please update the maze to reflect the new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (3, 1), and the goal position is still (0, 2).

Looking around the current position:
- Up: (2, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move up directly.
- Down: (4, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (3, 0) is a wall, so I cannot move left.
- Right: (3, 2) is an empty space, so I can move right.

However, I notice that I previously moved left from (3, 2) to (3, 1). Moving right back to (3, 2) would undo my previous move. Instead, I will try to find an alternative path.

Upon closer inspection, I notice that I can move up is not possible now, but I should continue trying to find a path that goes up. The only possible way to move forward is to move right to the next empty space and continue from there.

Next move: (3, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect the new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at the original position (3, 2) before my first move. With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (3, 2), and the goal position is still (0, 2).

Looking around the current position:
- Up: (2, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move up directly.
- Down: (4, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (3, 1) is an empty space, but I've been there before, and it didn't lead me to the goal.
- Right: (3, 3) is an empty space, so I can move right.

Since moving left doesn't seem to be helpful, I'll explore the right path. Moving right might help me find a way around the wall above me.

Next move: (3, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect the new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to the right. With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (3, 3), and the goal position is still (0, 2).

Looking around the current position:
- Up: (2, 3) is a wall, so I cannot move up directly.
- Down: (4, 3) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (3, 2) is an empty space, which I came from.
- Right: (3, 4) is an empty space, so I can move right.

However, moving further right doesn't seem to bring me closer to the goal. I should try to move up. Since I couldn't move up directly, I'll try to move around the wall above me. To do this, I'll need to go right and then possibly up or left.

But wait, I see that I can actually move around the wall by going right and then up through (2, 4).

First, I'll move right to (3, 4).

Next move: (3, 4)

Please update the maze to reflect the new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to the rightmost position. With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (3, 4), and the goal position is still (0, 2).

As planned, I'll try to move around the wall above me by moving up through (2, 4). However, I see that (2, 4) is a wall, which means I won't be able to move up through it.

I should now consider alternative paths. Since I couldn't move up or left through the wall, I can only try to backtrack and explore other paths that I haven't tried before.

However, I notice that the path to the left, which I've been ignoring, might actually be the key to solving the maze. If I go all the way to the left, I might be able to move up through the empty space.

I'll backtrack to the left and explore this path.

Next move: (3, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect the new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved back to the left. With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (3, 3), and the goal position is still (0, 2).

As I previously thought, I'll continue moving left to see if I can move up through the empty space. Since (3, 2) and (3, 1) are empty, I'll move left to (3, 1).

Next move is not immediately moving up, but moving left again to (3, 1) and after that possibly moving left again.

However I will move first to (3, 2) then to (3, 1) after I see the outcome.

First next move: (3, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect the new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to the left. With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (3, 2), and the goal position is still (0, 2).

As planned, I'll continue moving left to see if I can move up through the empty space. Since (3, 1) is empty, I'll move left to (3, 1).

Next move: (3, 1)

Please update the maze to reflect the new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to the left. With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (3, 1), and the goal position is still (0, 2).

Now that I've moved to the left, I'll try to move up through the empty space. However, (2, 1) is a wall, so I won't be able to move up directly.

But wait, I see that (3, 0) might not be a wall. If that's the case, I might be able to move up through (2, 0) or left to (3, 0) and then up.

Next move: (3, 0) or to be precise trying to move up by going left then immediately going up afterward when successful.

First next move: (3, 0)

Please update the maze to reflect the new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L-shape" or an "L-corridor"

To generate a new maze that meets the criteria, I will create a maze with the same size as the original (5x5) and a valid path from P to G that forms an L-shape. Here is the new maze:

1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 P 0 1
1 0 1 0 G
1 1 1 1 1

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that forms an L-shape, which is recognizable as the same general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze. Note that the new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but rather a new instance with the same shape characteristics.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
