You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (3, 2), represented by 'P'. I need to navigate to the goal position (0, 2), represented by 'G'.

After analyzing the maze, my next move will be to the left, to the empty space at coordinates (3, 1).

So, my next move is: (3, 1)

Please update the maze accordingly and provide the new maze for my next decision.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (3, 1), represented by 'P'. My goal is still to reach the goal position (0, 2), represented by 'G'.

After analyzing the maze, I see that I have a clear path upwards. My next move will be to the empty space at coordinates (2, 1).

So, my next move is: (2, 1)

Please update the maze accordingly and provide the new maze for my next decision.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (2, 1), represented by 'P'. My goal is still to reach the goal position (0, 2), represented by 'G'.

After analyzing the maze, I see that I need to move upwards again. My next move will be to the empty space at coordinates (1, 1).

So, my next move is: (1, 1)

Please update the maze accordingly and provide the new maze for my next decision.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (1, 1), represented by 'P'. My goal is still to reach the goal position (0, 2), represented by 'G'.

After analyzing the maze, I see that I have a clear path to the goal if I move to the left. My next move will be to the empty space at coordinates (1, 0), but then I'll have to go up again and then right to reach the goal. However, another option is to move to the right twice, but it seems blocked by walls.

So, my next move is: (1, 0)

However I also can move up one unit at (0,1) that seems more efficient and helps to reach 'G' faster 

My next move is: (0,1)

Please update the maze accordingly and provide the new maze for my next decision

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 P G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (0, 1), represented by 'P'. My goal is to reach the goal position (0, 2), represented by 'G'.

I'm so close! I just need to move to the right to reach the goal. My next move will be to the empty space at coordinates (0, 2).

So, my next move is: (0, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shape:


1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 0 P 0 G
1 1 1 1 1


Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it still forms an L-shape with its empty spaces, and it includes a valid path from P to G.
