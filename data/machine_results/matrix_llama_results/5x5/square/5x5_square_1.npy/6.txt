You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 G 0 0 1
1 0 1 P 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'd be happy to help solve the maze.

Based on the provided maze, I will analyze it and make my move. Here's my thought process:

The goal position is at (0,1) and the current player position is at (1,3). Since the goal is to navigate to the goal position while avoiding walls, I will try to move in the direction that brings me closer to the goal.

Considering the possible moves from the current position (1,3), I see that I can move either up, down, left, or right. However, moving up or down would result in hitting a wall. Moving right would also result in hitting a wall.

The only feasible move from the current position is to move left. This would bring me closer to the goal and give me more possible moves for the next step.

Therefore, my next move is to the left, to the coordinates (1,2).

Please update the maze with my new position, and I'll be happy to make my next move!

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag path" or a " serpentine corridor".

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zig-zag shape:

1 G 1 0 1
1 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar zig-zag path that allows the player to navigate from the current position (P) to the goal position (G). Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape and structure.

I hope this meets the requirements!
