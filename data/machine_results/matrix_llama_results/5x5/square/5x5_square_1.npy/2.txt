You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 G 0 0 1
1 0 1 P 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'd be happy to help solve the maze.

Based on the provided maze, I will analyze the current player position 'P' and its adjacent cells. The current position of 'P' is at (1,3). The adjacent cells are:

* Up: (0,3) -> '0' (empty space)
* Down: (2,3) -> '0' (empty space)
* Left: (1,2) -> '1' (wall)
* Right: (1,4) -> '1' (wall)

Considering the options, I will choose to move up to the empty space at (0,3) since it is closer to the goal 'G' at (0,1).

My next move is to (0,3).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 G 0 P 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the current player position 'P' and its adjacent cells. The current position of 'P' is at (0,3). The adjacent cells are:

* Up: Not possible, since we are already at the top row.
* Down: (1,3) -> '0' (empty space)
* Left: (0,2) -> '0' (empty space)
* Right: (0,4) -> '1' (wall)

Considering the options, I will choose to move left to the empty space at (0,2) since it is closer to the goal 'G' at (0,1).

My next move is to (0,2).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 G P 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the current player position 'P' and its adjacent cells. The current position of 'P' is at (0,2). The adjacent cells are:

* Up: Not possible, since we are already at the top row.
* Down: (1,2) -> '1' (wall)
* Left: (0,1) -> 'G' (goal)
* Right: (0,3) -> '0' (empty space)

Considering the options, I will choose to move left to the goal position 'G' at (0,1).

My next move is to (0,1).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Note: This move should actually end the game, as I have reached the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A rectangle with a small protrusion (or a "pocket") on one side, near the goal position.

To generate a new maze with the same characteristics, I came up with:

(2) Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a rectangular shape with a small protrusion near the goal position, similar to the original maze. The path from 'P' to 'G' is solvable, and the maze is not an identical copy of the original.
