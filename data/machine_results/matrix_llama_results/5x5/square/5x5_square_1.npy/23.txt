You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 G 0 0 1
1 0 1 P 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The current player position is at (1, 3), marked by 'P'. The goal position is at (0, 1), marked by 'G'. 

I will examine the four possible directions (up, down, left, right) and look for adjacent empty spaces. Moving up is not possible because of the wall at (0, 3). Moving down is possible because the space at (2, 3) is empty. Moving left is possible because the space at (1, 2) is empty. Moving right is not possible because of the wall at (1, 4).

Considering these options, I will choose to move down to the empty space at (2, 3).

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 G 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

I am currently at position (2, 3), marked by 'P'. My goal is still to reach (0, 1), marked by 'G'. 

I will examine the four possible directions (up, down, left, right) and look for adjacent empty spaces. Moving down is not possible because of the wall at (3, 3). Moving right is not possible because of the wall at (2, 4). Moving up is possible because the space at (1, 3) is empty, but that would be going back. Moving left is possible because the space at (2, 2) is empty.

Considering these options, I will choose to move left to the empty space at (2, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 G 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

I am currently at position (2, 2), marked by 'P'. My goal is still to reach (0, 1), marked by 'G'.

I will examine the four possible directions (up, down, left, right) and look for adjacent empty spaces. Moving down is not possible because of the wall at (3, 2). Moving right is possible because the space at (2, 3) is empty, but that would be going back. Moving left is possible because the space at (2, 1) is empty. Moving up is possible because the space at (1, 2) is not empty due to a wall but the space at (1, 1) is also empty and for going to (0,1) the optimal solution is moving up-left.

Considering these options, I will choose to move left to the empty space at (2, 1).

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 G 0 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

I am currently at position (2, 1), marked by 'P'. My goal is still to reach (0, 1), marked by 'G'. 

I will examine the four possible directions (up, down, left, right) and look for adjacent empty spaces. Moving down is not possible because of the wall at (3, 1). Moving right is possible because the space at (2, 2) is empty, but that would be going back in the direction away from G. Moving left is not possible because of the wall at (2, 0) doesn't exist but the one at (1,0) does so I couldn't go left anyway. Moving up is possible because the space at (1, 1) is empty.

Considering these options, I will choose to move up to the empty space at (1, 1).

The coordinates of my next move are (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 G 0 0 1
1 P 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

I am currently at position (1, 1), marked by 'P'. My goal is still to reach (0, 1), marked by 'G'.

I will examine the four possible directions (up, down, left, right) and look for adjacent empty spaces. Moving down is possible because the space at (2, 1) is empty, but that would be going back. Moving right is not possible because of the wall at (1, 2). Moving left is not possible, but that is where the goal is, so I can move up to the space that has the goal (0,1) is possible and optimal.

The coordinates of my next move are (0, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) L-shape

The empty spaces form a distinctive L-shape that connects the starting position 'P' to the goal position 'G'.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape that connects the starting position 'P' to the goal position 'G', similar to the original maze. Note that the new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but rather a new configuration that preserves the same L-shape formed by the empty spaces.
