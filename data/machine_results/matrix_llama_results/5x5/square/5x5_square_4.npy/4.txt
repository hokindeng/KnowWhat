You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 G 0 P
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is P, which is located at (2,4). The goal position is G, located at (2,2).

To navigate towards the goal, I need to move P from (2,4) to an adjacent empty space. Since the wall to the left (at (2,3)) blocks the direct path to the goal, I will choose to move up from the current position.

My next move will be to move P to the position above it, which is (1,4). However, I notice that (1,4) is not an empty space, but rather it's outside of the movable area since it's blocked by a wall at (1,3), but (1,4) itself is empty (0).

Considering alternative moves, I can see that moving left is blocked by a wall, and moving down is blocked by the boundary of the maze. The only viable move is to move P to (3,4), which is not blocked, but doesn't lead closer to the goal. The move with the highest probability of getting closer is to attempt moving P up then right as I need to get closer to G so I'll move temporarily into 1,4 to enable other potential moves.


Therefore, my next move will be: **(1,4)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 P
1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I have successfully moved to (1,4). Now, my next goal is to navigate closer to the goal position (G) at (2,2).

From my current position (1,4), I can move down, left, or right. Moving down would take me further away from the goal, and moving right would also not bring me closer to the goal. However, moving left would allow me to move closer to the goal.

I will move P to the left. 

The position to the left of (1,4) is (1,3), which is a wall. So I will move to the position to the left of that which is (1,2) is not empty, but it has wall above it at (0,2) and a 1 below but this does not mean anything since the move is one space but the second space from that is an open space it will allow future moves


However that is actually an available move location since the first left move lands on a '1' but the next would remain inside of the boundary so the plan for the attempt from this row requires a two space jump doesn't offer a full analysis.

From my current position (1,4), I will move P to (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 P
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (0,4), I need to move closer to the goal position (G) at (2,2).

To navigate towards the goal, I can move down from my current position. 

My next move will be to move P to the position below it, which is (1,4).

The coordinates of my next move are: **(1,4)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 P
1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back to a familiar position.

From my current position (1,4), I need to move closer to the goal position (G) at (2,2). Since moving down would take me further away from the goal, and moving right is not possible, I will move P left.

However, the position to the left of (1,4) is (1,3), which is a wall. So, I will move P to the position to the left of that, which is (1,2).

The coordinates of my next move are: **(1,2)**

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, where the empty spaces form the same L-shape:


1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1
