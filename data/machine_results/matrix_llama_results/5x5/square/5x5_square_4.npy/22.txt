You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 G 0 P
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position (P) is at (2,4), and the goal position (G) is at (2,2). To move towards the goal, I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces.

Since I can move in any of the four directions (up, down, left, or right), I will check the adjacent spaces:

* Up: (1,4) is blocked by a wall (1).
* Down: (3,4) is blocked by a wall (1).
* Left: (2,3) is an empty space (0).
* Right: Out of bounds (no space available).

Considering these options, I will choose to move left to the empty space at coordinates (2,3).

My next move is to (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 G P 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've moved to (2,3), I will analyze the situation again to decide on the next move.

The current player position (P) is at (2,3), and the goal position (G) is at (2,2). To move towards the goal, I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces.

Since I can move in any of the four directions (up, down, left, or right), I will check the adjacent spaces:

* Up: (1,3) is blocked by a wall (1).
* Down: (3,3) is blocked by a wall (1).
* Left: (2,2) is the goal position (G).
* Right: (2,4) is an empty space, but moving right would not bring me closer to the goal.

Considering these options, I will choose to move left to the goal position at coordinates (2,2).

My next move is to (2,2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A rectangular tunnel or a rectangle with two opposite corners connected by a straight path.

Now, here is a new maze of the same size (5x5), with empty spaces that form the same shape:

1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 G
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces also form a rectangular tunnel or a rectangle with two opposite corners connected by a straight path. The maze has a valid path from P to G, and it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
