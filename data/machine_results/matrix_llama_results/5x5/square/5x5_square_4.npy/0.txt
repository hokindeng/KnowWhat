You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 G 0 P
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is P, which is located at (2,4). The goal position is G, located at (2,2).

To navigate towards the goal, I need to move P. Looking at the adjacent empty spaces, I can move either up, left, or down. However, moving down is not a viable option as it would put me into a wall.

Between moving up and left, I will choose to move left. The new coordinates for P will be (2,3).

So, my next move is to (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 G P 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (2,3) successfully. Now I'll analyze the situation again.

To reach the goal position G, which is located at (2,2), I need to move left again. The new coordinates for P will be (2,2).

However, I notice that G is already at (2,2). This means I can reach the goal by moving left, and I will effectively swap positions with G.

So, my next move is to (2,2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) L-shape

The empty spaces form a distinctive L-shape that connects the starting point P to the goal point G.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 0 P 0 G
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar L-shape that connects the starting point P to the goal point G. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape and allows for a valid path from P to G.
