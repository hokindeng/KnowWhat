You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 G 0 P
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'd be happy to help solve the maze.

Based on the initial maze, I see that the current player position 'P' is at coordinates (2, 4). The goal position 'G' is at coordinates (2, 2).

My next move would be to move left. I'll provide the coordinates of the new position: (2, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect this move and present it to me again.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 G P 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue from the current position.

Since I've moved left and I'm now at coordinates (2, 3), my next move would be to move left again. However, I see that the goal position 'G' is adjacent to me, and I can reach it by moving one step to the left.

So, my next move would be to move left to the goal position. I'll provide the coordinates of the new position: (2, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect this move and let me know if I've solved it!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would say that the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is an "L" shape.

Here is a new maze with the same size as the original, where the empty spaces form an "L" shape:

1 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 0
1 1 P 1 G
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the corridors form an "L" shape, and there is a valid path from 'P' to 'G' that can be reached through empty spaces. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it shares the same shape and size characteristics.
