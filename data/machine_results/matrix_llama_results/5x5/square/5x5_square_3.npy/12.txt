You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position 'P' is at coordinates (4,2). Our goal is to reach 'G' at coordinates (2,4). 

Since we can move up, down, left, or right, we need to explore our options. 

As we are at (4,2), we can move to the following coordinates:
- Up: (3,2) - which is empty (0)
- Down: We are at the border of the maze, so we cannot move down.
- Left: (4,1) - which is a wall (1)
- Right: (4,3) - which is empty (0)

Given the options, we should move right to (4,3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 0 0 1 0
1 1 P 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape, just like in the original maze. The player position 'P' is at coordinates (4,2), and the goal position 'G' is at coordinates (2,4). The maze is not identical to the original, but it has the same size and a valid path from P to G through empty spaces.
