You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will make my next move to the position (2,2).

My current position (P) is (4,2). I will move up to the empty space (0) at coordinates (3,2), and then I will be able to move again from there.

However, as per the problem statement, I need to provide the coordinates of my next move. My next move will be to (3,2).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (3,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 P 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will make my next move to the position (2,2). 

Since my current position (P) is (3,2), moving up will take me to (2,2) which is an empty space (0).

So, the coordinates of my next move are (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting close to the goal (G). My next move will be to the right, to the empty space at coordinates (2,3) and then then next I'll be adjacent to the goal.

So, the coordinates of my next move are (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm right next to the goal (G) now. Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position, and I want to reach the goal (G), my next move will be to the right, to the goal position itself.

So, the coordinates of the goal position (G) and thus my next move are (2,4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as an "L" shape or a "corner".

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar L-shape or corner, but it's not an identical copy of the original maze. There's a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces.
