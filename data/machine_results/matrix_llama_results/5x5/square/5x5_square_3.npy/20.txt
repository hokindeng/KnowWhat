You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (4, 2), and the goal position is (2, 3). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Looking at the maze, the possible moves from the current position (4, 2) are:

- Up: (3, 2) is an empty space.
- Down: Not possible (outside the maze boundary)
- Left: (4, 1) is a wall.
- Right: (4, 3) is an empty space.

I will choose to move up to (3, 2) as it is an empty space and seems like a reasonable direction to move closer to the goal.

Next move coordinates: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 P 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (3, 2), and the goal position is (2, 3). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Looking at the maze, the possible moves from the current position (3, 2) are:

- Up: (2, 2) is an empty space.
- Down: (4, 2) is an empty space (already visited)
- Left: (3, 1) is a wall.
- Right: (3, 3) is a wall.

I will choose to move up to (2, 2) as it is an empty space and brings me closer to the goal.

Next move coordinates: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

The current player position is (2, 2), and the goal position is (2, 4) - I'm close!

Looking at the maze, the possible moves from the current position (2, 2) are:

- Up: Not possible (outside the maze boundary or wall)
- Down: (3, 2) is an empty space (already visited)
- Left: (2, 1) is a wall.
- Right: (2, 3) is an empty space and leads to the goal.

I will choose to move right to (2, 3) as it is an empty space and directly adjacent to the goal.

Next move coordinates: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm almost there!

The current player position is (2, 3), and the goal position is (2, 4). 

Looking at the maze, the only possible move from the current position (2, 3) is:

- Right: (2, 4) which is the goal position!

I will choose to move right to (2, 4) to reach the goal.

Next move coordinates: (2, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) L-shape

The empty spaces form a rough L-shape that connects the starting position (P) to the goal position (G).

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 G
1 1 0 0 0

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape that connects the starting position (P) to the goal position (G), similar to the original maze. However, this is not an identical copy of the original maze.
