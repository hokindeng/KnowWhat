You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position (4,2), marked by 'P'. My goal is to reach position (2,4), marked by 'G'. 

To start, I will look at the adjacent positions around me (up, down, left, and right). 

- Up: (3,2) is an empty space '0', so I can move up. 
- Down: (5,2) is a wall '1', so I cannot move down. 
- Left: (4,1) is a wall '1', so I cannot move left. 
- Right: (4,3) is an empty space '0', so I can move right. 

Given these options, I will choose to move up to position (3,2) to try to find a path to the goal. My next move is (3,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 P 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at position (3,2), marked by 'P'. My goal is still to reach position (2,4), marked by 'G'.

I will look at the adjacent positions around me (up, down, left, and right).

- Up: (2,2) is a wall '1', so I cannot move up.
- Down: (4,2) is an empty space '0', so I can move down.
- Left: (3,1) is a wall '1', so I cannot move left.
- Right: (3,3) is a wall '1', so I cannot move right.

Given these options, I will choose to move down to position (4,2) to try to find an alternative path to the goal. However, I noticed that I already visited (4,2) previously, and from there, I moved up to (3,2). To avoid revisiting old positions, I should look ahead and explore other possible moves.

A better option would be to think ahead and try to move to a new position. Considering the overall maze layout and my goal, I will choose to move down to (4,2) and then immediately think about the next move from there.

From (4,2), I can move right to (4,3), which might lead me closer to the goal.

So, I will move down to (4,2) for now, but my plan is to move right to (4,3) next.

Please note that this is a bit of an intermediate step, and I would like to move to (4,3) as soon as possible.

My next move is (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

As I planned earlier, I will move right to (4,3) since it's an empty space and might lead me closer to the goal.

My next move is (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at position (4,3), marked by 'P'. My goal is still to reach position (2,4), marked by 'G'.

I will look at the adjacent positions around me (up, down, left, and right).

- Up: (3,3) is a wall '1', so I cannot move up.
- Down: Not possible since I am already at the bottom row.
- Left: (4,2) is an empty space '0', so I can move left.
- Right: (4,4) is an empty space '0', so I can move right.

Since my goal is to the right and up, I will choose to move right to position (4,4) to get closer to the goal.

My next move is (4,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at position (4,4), marked by 'P'. My goal is still to reach position (2,4), marked by 'G'.

I will look at the adjacent positions around me (up, down, left, and right).

- Up: (3,4) is an empty space '0', so I can move up.
- Down: Not possible since I am already at the bottom row.
- Left: (4,3) is an empty space '0', so I can move left.
- Right: Not possible since I am already at the rightmost column.

Since my goal is up from my current position, I will choose to move up to position (3,4) to get closer to the goal.

My next move is (3,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 P
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

I am currently at position (3,4), marked by 'P', but I think there is a slight discrepancy. It appears that I am actually at (3,3), adjacent to the '1' wall, rather than at (3,4). Nevertheless, my goal is still to reach position (2,4), marked by 'G'.

I will look at the adjacent positions around me (up, down, left, and right).

- Up: (2,3) is an empty space '0', and adjacent to it is the goal 'G' at (2,4), so I can move up.
- Down: (4,3) is an empty space '0', but moving down will take me away from the goal.
- Left: (3,2) is an empty space '0', but moving left will not bring me closer to the goal.
- Right: (3,4) is not possible since the '1' wall is blocking me.

Since my goal is up from my current position, I will choose to move up to position (2,3) and then aim for the goal 'G' at (2,4).

However, the coordinates I need to provide should get me closer to (2,4), which would mean moving up to (2,3) initially.

My next move is (2,3), but keep in mind that the goal is to eventually move to (2,4) if possible.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "staircase" or an "L-shape" with some additional connections.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar staircase shape:


1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 0 0
1 P 0 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a staircase shape that connects the starting point 'P' to the goal 'G'. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares a similar overall structure.
