You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position (4, 2), marked as 'P'. My goal is to reach position (2, 4), marked as 'G'. To get closer to my goal, I will move to an adjacent empty space.

After analyzing the maze, I have decided to move up. My new position will be (3, 2), which is currently an empty space marked as '0'.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (3, 2)

Please update the maze with my new position and provide the updated maze for my next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 P 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position (3, 2), marked as 'P'. My goal is still to reach position (2, 4), marked as 'G'. To get closer to my goal, I will move left. However, I notice that the left space is a wall. So, I will move right instead. But the right space is also a wall. 

Therefore, I will move up. My new position will not be an empty space because the up space is also a wall. So I must move down. My new position will be (4, 2), which is currently an empty space marked as '0'.

However, simply going down would undo the progress I already made by going up, so I must move diagonally in some way. However, I must do this within the constraints of the maze, i.e., by going right after going down.

But, going right after going down will not bring me any progress toward the goal 'G'. 

Going left after going down, I will be in a column where there is an empty space that would allow me to make further progress up if I wanted to. Therefore, the strategy is to go far left (go down and then left).

The first step in going far left is going down, however, I am going to provide the move as going down then left.

But since you want 1 step per request I'll give the first step only which is down.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (4, 2)

Please update the maze with my new position and provide the updated maze for my next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I am currently at position (4, 2), marked as 'P'. My goal is to reach position (2, 4), marked as 'G'. 

Since my strategy is to go far left, I need to move left. My new position will be (4, 1), which is currently an empty space is not available, however there is an empty space at (4,1)  one column to the left of my current position, unfortunately it's occupied with '1' a wall. We have a column filled with zeros at column (4,0), however to reach it I must attempt going left one step first.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "L-shape" or "Inverted L-shape" since the empty spaces resemble a 90-degree angle, forming an "L" shape that spans across two rows and three columns in the bottom left corner of the maze, with the goal position 'G' at the top-right corner of the L-shape.

Here is a new maze with empty spaces that form the same "L-shape", meeting the specified criteria:


1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 G 0
1 1 0 0 1
1 P 0 0 0


Note that the new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it still maintains the "L-shape" formed by the empty spaces, with a valid path from 'P' to 'G'.
