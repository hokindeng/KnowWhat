You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move. 

I am currently at position (4, 2), marked as 'P'. My goal is to reach position (2, 4), marked as 'G'. To get closer to my goal, I will move to an adjacent empty space.

After analyzing the maze, I have decided to move up. My new position will be (3, 2), which is currently an empty space marked as '0'.

My next move coordinates are (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 P 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I am now at position (3, 2), marked as 'P'. To continue moving closer to my goal (2, 4), I will analyze the adjacent positions. 

Since I am now at (3, 2), I can move left or right along the row, but there is a wall to my left and right. I can move up or down along the column. Moving down will take me away from the goal, so I will move up.

Moving up, I will reach position (2, 2), which is currently an empty space marked as '0'.

My next move coordinates are (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I am now at position (2, 2), marked as 'P'. To continue moving closer to my goal (2, 4), I will analyze the adjacent positions.

Since I am now at (2, 2), I can move right along the row. There is an empty space to my right, at position (2, 3), but then there is the goal position (2, 4) after that. I will move right.

However, to make an efficient move, I will move to the right-most accessible empty space adjacent to me, which is position (2, 3).

My next move coordinates are (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I am now at position (2, 3), marked as 'P'. To continue moving closer to my goal (2, 4), I will analyze the adjacent positions.

Since I am now at (2, 3), I can move right along the row. There is the goal position (2, 4) adjacent to me, so I will move right.

My next move coordinates are (2, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) L-shape

The empty spaces form a distinctive L-shape that connects the starting point 'P' to the goal point 'G'.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 0 0 1 G
1 P 0 0 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape that connects the starting point 'P' to the goal point 'G', just like in the original maze. However, the positions of the walls and empty spaces are different, making it a distinct maze.
