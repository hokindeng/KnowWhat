You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (4, 2), and the goal position is (2, 3). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Looking around the current position (4, 2), I notice that I can move up or right, as both spaces are empty. However, moving right would lead to a dead end, as the wall above the goal prevents any further progress in that direction. Therefore, my best option is to move up.

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I'll plan the next move accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 P 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (3, 2), and the goal position is still (2, 3). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Looking around the current position (3, 2), I notice that I can move left, up, or down, but moving down would lead to a previously visited space. Moving left is not possible as the goal position requires me to move up. Moving up would lead closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I'll plan the next move accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (2, 2), and the goal position is still (2, 3). I will explore the neighboring empty spaces to find a suitable move.

Looking around the current position (2, 2), I notice that I can move right, as the space adjacent to the goal is empty. Moving right would lead directly to the goal's neighboring space, putting me one step away from reaching the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 3).

However, I realize that the goal is already at (2, 3), so I am moving directly into the goal position. This should end the maze-solving process.

If the maze is indeed solved, please acknowledge. Otherwise, I'll continue planning the next moves.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I was close, but it seems I didn't quite reach the goal.

Since I'm already at (2, 3) and the goal is also at (2, 3) but I didn't quite reach it, I assume the goal is actually at (2, 4) and I need to move right.

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 4).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A reversed L-shape or a inverted L-shape.

To generate a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape, here is a new maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0
1 1 P 1 G
1 1 0 1 0

This new maze meets the criteria:

* It has the same size as the original maze (5x5)
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as a reversed L-shape or an inverted L-shape.
