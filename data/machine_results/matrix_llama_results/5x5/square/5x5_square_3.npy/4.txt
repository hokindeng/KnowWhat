You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is (4, 2), and the goal position is (2, 3). The maze has walls all around the edges, and there are some internal walls as well.

For my next move, I would like to move up to the position (3, 2), which is an empty space.

My next move coordinates are: (3, 2)

Please provide the updated maze after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 P 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I'm now closer to the goal.

My next move will be to move left to the position (3, 1) and then up, but I first need to go around the wall that is in the way, but left is a wall (1), so I should instead go up is also a wall (1). I will move right to (3, 3) is also a wall (1), I can move to position (3, 4) or (4,2).

My next move coordinates are: (3, 4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) L-shape

The empty spaces form a rough L-shape that connects the player's starting position (P) to the goal position (G).

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 G 1
1 P 1 0 0
1 1 1 0 0

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is still recognizable as an L-shape. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it maintains the same overall structure and shape.
