You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

The current player position is represented by 'P', which is located at coordinates (4, 2). The goal position 'G' is located at coordinates (2, 3). Since I can only move through empty spaces ('0') and avoid walls ('1'), I need to find an adjacent empty space to move to.

After examining the maze, I notice that I can move either left, up, or right from the current position. Since I want to move closer to the goal, I will choose to move up.

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 P 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and decide on the next move.

I am now at position (3, 2). My goal is still to reach position (2, 3), where the goal 'G' is located. Since I can only move through empty spaces and avoid walls, I will look for an adjacent empty space to move to.

After examining the maze, I notice that I can move either left or right from the current position. However, since the goal is above me, I would like to move left to create an opportunity to move up in the next step.

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is an "L" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size, encoding, and shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 P 0 0 0

This new maze has the same size and encoding as the original, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The empty spaces form an "L" shape, similar to the original maze. The path from P to G can be navigated through the empty spaces.
