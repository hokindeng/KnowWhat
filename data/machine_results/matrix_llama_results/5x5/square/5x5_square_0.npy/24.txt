You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. 

I'm currently at position (3,2) marked 'P'. My goal is to reach position (3,0) marked 'G'.

My possible moves from (3,2) are up, down, left, or right. However, I'm blocked by walls in all directions except for left.

Therefore, my next move will be left to position (3,1).

The coordinates of my next move are: (3,1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "H" shape

The original maze has a horizontal corridor connecting the left and right sides, with a vertical corridor in the middle that connects the top and bottom parts of the "H" shape.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 0
G 1 P 1 1
0 1 1 1 0

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form an "H" shape, with a horizontal corridor connecting the left and right sides, and a vertical corridor in the middle.
