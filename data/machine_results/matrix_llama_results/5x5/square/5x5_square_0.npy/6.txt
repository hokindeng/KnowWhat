You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. The current player position is at 'P', which is located at (3,2) since the top left corner is (0,0) and we count rows and columns starting from 0. The goal position 'G' is at (3,0). Given the layout of the maze and the rules for movement, we need to navigate from 'P' to 'G'.

Since we can move up, down, left, or right into empty spaces, the most direct path to 'G' involves avoiding the walls ('1'). The optimal first move from 'P' (3,2) would be to move left to the empty space, which is at (3,1), as it brings us closer to 'G' without hitting a wall.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "T".

(2) Here is a new maze with empty spaces that form the same shape, a "T", and meet the given criteria:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a "T" shape, allowing for a valid path from 'P' to 'G'. The maze is not an identical copy of the original and maintains the same size.
