You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since we are currently at position 'P', which is at (3,2), our goal is to reach 'G' at (3,0).

Looking at the maze, we can see that we are blocked by walls to the east and south. However, there are empty spaces to the west and north.

A good next move would be to move north to the empty space at (2,2). This will allow us to get closer to the goal and also create more options for future moves.

So, my next move would be to (2,2). 

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2,2). To get closer to the goal 'G', which is at (3,0), my next move would be to move west to the empty space at (2,1). This will allow me to create more options and eventually move south towards the goal.

So, my next move would be to (2,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2,1). I'm closer to the goal, but I'm still a bit too far north. Since the goal 'G' is to my south, my next move would be to move south to the empty space at (3,1), then eventually make my way west to reach 'G'.

However, since I'm already quite close to the western edge, I'll move west first to the empty space at (2,0), to avoid complications, then move south.

So, my next move would be to (2,0), then ultimately south.

But for now, just to (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2,0). To reach the goal 'G', which is directly south of me at (3,0), I can simply move south to (3,0).

So, my next move would be to (3,0). This should take me directly to the goal 'G' and complete the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner shape". This is because the empty spaces form a distinctive 90-degree angle or corner, with two perpendicular arms.

Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0
1 G P 1 1
1 1 0 0 0

Note that this new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and forms the same L-shape with its empty spaces.
