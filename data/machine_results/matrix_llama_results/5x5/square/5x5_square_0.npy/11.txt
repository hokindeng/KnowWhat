You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan our next move. We start at position 'P' and aim to reach position 'G'. 

To find a path, we can think several steps ahead, but let's focus on our immediate next move. Given the constraints of the maze, from 'P', we can only move down since moving up, left, or right is blocked by walls ('1').

So, from the position 'P' at coordinates (3,2) considering (0,0) as the top left corner, my next move would be down to coordinates (4,2).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 P 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, our current position 'P' is now at coordinates (4,2).

Looking at the surrounding spaces, we have a choice to move left to an empty space ('0') or stay put. Moving up is blocked by a wall ('1'), moving down is out of bounds, and moving right is also blocked by a wall ('1'). To progress towards 'G', moving left seems the most logical choice.

My next move would be left to coordinates (4,1).

Please update the maze accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 P 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, our current position 'P' is at coordinates (4,1).

The goal position 'G' is now diagonally up and to the left. We can't move diagonally, so we must plan a path to reach 'G' by moving either up, down, left, or right to adjacent empty spaces.

Moving left would lead us away from 'G', moving down is out of bounds, and moving right would put us back to a previously visited spot, which doesn't help us reach 'G' directly. 

Therefore, the best option is to move up to coordinates (3,1), which brings us closer to 'G'.

My next move would be up to coordinates (3,1).

Please update the maze accordingly.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "cross" or "plus sign" shape.

Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 P 0 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1

This new maze meets the criteria, as it:

* Has the same size as the original maze
* Includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
* Is not an identical copy of the original maze
* Forms a cross or plus sign shape with its empty spaces.
