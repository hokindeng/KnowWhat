You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (4, 3), and the adjacent empty spaces are (3, 3), (4, 2).

Since the goal position is (3, 1), I will move to the empty space that is closest to the goal. In this case, I will move to (3, 3).

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. The adjacent empty spaces are (2, 3), (2, 2), and (4, 3).

Since the goal position is (3, 1), I will move to the empty space that is closest to the goal. In this case, I will move to (2, 3) and then try to move closer to the goal from there, but I notice that (2, 2) is also a good option as it is closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate and also has the possibility of moving up towards the goal. However, I will choose (2, 3) for now.

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. The adjacent empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), and (3, 3).

Since the goal position is (3, 1), I will move to the empty space that is closest to the goal. In this case, I will move to (2, 2) because it is closer to the goal in terms of the y-coordinate and also has the possibility of moving right towards the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. However, I notice that there are no adjacent empty spaces that I can move to directly.

But I can try to move to a position that will bring me closer to the goal. I will move to (3, 3) because it is closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate, and then I can try to find a way to move down to the goal from there.

However, I also notice that the goal is just one step down from my current x-coordinate, but there is a wall at (2, 1). If I could move to (3, 2), I could potentially move down to the goal, but unfortunately, there is a wall at (3, 2).

So, my best option is to move to (3, 3) and then try to find a way to move down to the goal from there.

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. However, I notice that there are no adjacent empty spaces that I can move to directly that will bring me closer to the goal.

But I can try to move to a position that will bring me closer to the goal. Unfortunately, I'm stuck at this position because I've already explored the adjacent positions and there's no clear path to the goal.

However, I can try to backtrack to a previous position and explore other options. Let me re-examine the maze and see if I can find an alternative path.

After re-examining the maze, I realize that I made a mistake earlier. I should have explored the left side of the maze more thoroughly. I will backtrack to (2, 2) and then try to move left to see if I can find a path to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at position (2, 2), I will try to move left to see if I can find a path to the goal. The adjacent empty space to the left is (1, 3), but it's not directly left, it's left and up. However, I can try to move to (1, 3) and then see if I can find a way to move down to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. However, I notice that there are no adjacent empty spaces that I can move to directly that will bring me closer to the goal.

But I can try to move to a position that will bring me closer to the goal. I will move to (2, 3) because it is closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate, and then I can try to find a way to move down to the goal from there.

However, I also notice that I've already explored this path before, and it didn't lead me to the goal. I need to think of a different approach.

After re-examining the maze, I realize that I need to find a way to move down to the goal. I will try to move to (2, 2) and then see if I can find a way to move down to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at position (2, 2), I will try to think of a different approach to reach the goal. I notice that I've already explored the right and left sides of the maze, and I couldn't find a path to the goal.

I will try to move down to the goal, but there is a wall at (2, 1). I need to find a way to move around this wall. I notice that there is an empty space at (4, 1), which is below the wall. I will try to move to (4, 1) and then see if I can find a way to move up to the goal.

However, I'm not at (4, 1) yet. I need to move to a position that will bring me closer to (4, 1). I will move to (4, 2) because it is closer to (4, 1), and then I can try to move down to (4, 1) from there.

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original maze, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as a zigzag or staircase shape, similar to the original maze. However, this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze.
