You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and goal
The player is currently at position (4, 3), and the goal is to reach position (3, 1).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (4, 3), we need to look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), and (4, 2). Since we can move in any of the eight directions, we need to find which of these empty spaces is closest to the goal (3, 1) and is reachable from our current position.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Looking at the empty spaces, moving directly towards the goal is not possible since it involves moving through walls. However, we can move diagonally or horizontally/vertically to an adjacent empty space that brings us closer to the goal. The closest empty space to our current position that also moves us in the direction of the goal would be (3, 3), as it allows us to move closer to the goal position (3, 1) compared to the other options.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the best next move would be to move to position (3, 3), as it is an empty space adjacent to our current position and brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (3, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position (4, 3) which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Identify the goal and current position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), and the player is now at (3, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's new position (3, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we need to move closer to the goal (3, 1), we should consider moves that either bring us closer to the goal directly or position us for a future move towards the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Considering the empty spaces and the goal, moving directly to the goal is not possible due to the wall at (3, 2). However, we can move to an adjacent empty space that could bring us closer or position us better for the next move. The closest and most strategic empty space to move to would be (2, 3), as it allows us to potentially move around the wall blocking the direct path to the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the best next move would be to move to position (2, 3), as it is an empty space that positions us better for a future move towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (2, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Identify the goal and current position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), and the player is now at (2, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's new position (2, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we need to move closer to the goal (3, 1), we should consider moves that either bring us closer to the goal directly or position us for a future move towards the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Considering the empty spaces and the goal, moving directly to the goal is still not possible due to the wall at (3, 2) and the wall at (2, 1). However, we can move to an adjacent empty space that could bring us closer or position us better for the next move. The closest and most strategic empty space to move to would be (2, 2), as it allows us to potentially move around the wall blocking the direct path to the goal and gets us closer to the goal's column.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the best next move would be to move to position (2, 2), as it is an empty space that positions us better for a future move towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move

## Step 2: Identify the goal and current position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), and the player is now at (2, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's new position (2, 2), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we need to move closer to the goal (3, 1), we should consider moves that either bring us closer to the goal directly or position us for a future move towards the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Considering the empty spaces and the goal, moving directly to the goal is still not possible due to the wall at (3, 2) and the wall at (2, 1). However, we can move to an adjacent empty space that could bring us closer or position us better for the next move. Given the current position and the goal, it seems we've reached a point where we cannot move closer to the goal due to the surrounding walls and the nature of the maze. However, upon closer inspection, we realize that we are actually blocked from reaching the goal due to the constraints of the maze's walls.

## Step 5: Realize the limitation
Given the maze's constraints and the rules of movement, it appears that there is no valid move that brings us closer to the goal without going through walls, which is not allowed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{None}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a diagonal line or a staircase, but given the constraints and the arrangement, it's more accurate to describe it as an "L" shape or a broken diagonal line. However, considering the overall structure and the goal of generating a similar maze, we can generalize the shape as a "staircase" or "L" shape.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same size and a similar "L" or "staircase" shape formed by the empty spaces, we need to rearrange the walls and empty spaces while ensuring there is a valid path from the player's position (P) to the goal (G).

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Let's create a new maze that meets the criteria. The new maze will have the same size (5x5) and will include a path from P to G that forms an "L" or "staircase" shape.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Here is the new maze encoded in the same format as the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

The final answer is: 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)
