You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and goal
The player is currently at position (4, 3), and the goal is to reach position (3, 1).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (4, 3), we need to look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), and (4, 2). Since we can move in any of the eight directions, we need to find which of these empty spaces is closest to the goal (3, 1) and is reachable from our current position.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Looking at the empty spaces, moving directly towards the goal is not possible since it's blocked by walls. However, we can move to (3, 3), which is closer to the goal and is an empty space adjacent to our current position.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
The next move should be to (3, 3) as it is the closest empty space to the goal that we can reach from our current position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (3, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position (4, 3) which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), and we need to find a way to get closer to it from the current position (3, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's current position (3, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are trying to reach (3, 1), we need to find an empty space that brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Consider the constraints
Moving directly to the goal is not possible because there is a wall at (3, 2) blocking the path. Therefore, we need to find an alternative route that goes around the walls.

## Step 5: Determine the best move
Given the constraints, the best move would be to move to (2, 3), as it is an empty space that allows us to potentially go around the wall blocking the direct path to the goal.

## Step 6: Choose the next move
The next move should be to (2, 3) as it provides a possible path to maneuver around the walls and get closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (2, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), and we need to find a way to get closer to it from the current position (2, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's current position (2, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are trying to reach (3, 1), we need to find an empty space that brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Consider the constraints
Moving directly to the goal is still not possible because there is a wall at (3, 2) and (2, 1) blocking the path. However, we can move to (2, 2), which is closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate and provides a potential path to maneuver around the walls.

## Step 5: Determine the best move
Given the constraints, the best move would be to move to (2, 2), as it is an empty space that allows us to potentially go around the wall blocking the direct path to the goal.

## Step 6: Choose the next move
The next move should be to (2, 2) as it provides a possible path to get closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (2, 2), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), and we need to find a way to get closer to it from the current position (2, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's current position (2, 2), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are trying to reach (3, 1), we need to find an empty space that brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Consider the constraints
Moving directly to the goal is still not possible because there is a wall at (3, 2) and (2, 1) blocking the path. However, we can move to (3, 3), which is closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate and provides a potential path to maneuver around the walls.

## Step 5: Determine the best move
Given the constraints, the best move would be to move to (3, 3), as it is an empty space that allows us to potentially go around the wall blocking the direct path to the goal and sets us up for a potential move to the goal.

## Step 6: Choose the next move
However, considering the goal is at (3, 1) and there's a wall at (3, 2), moving to (3, 3) doesn't directly help. We need to reassess our strategy to directly approach the goal or find an alternative route that could lead to the goal more efficiently.

## Step 7: Reconsider the strategy
Given the layout and the goal, a more direct approach would involve moving to a position that allows a direct path to the goal or minimizes the distance. However, the current layout doesn't provide a straightforward path without backtracking or considering alternative routes that might not be immediately apparent.

## Step 8: Final decision
Given the constraints and the goal, we should aim to move closer to the goal or find a position that offers more flexibility for the next move. However, my analysis led to a point where the direct move to achieve this isn't clear without reconsidering the entire path or having more flexibility in movement. The initial thought to move to (3, 3) is actually the correct move to get closer to the goal's x-coordinate, despite my later hesitation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (3, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), and we need to find a way to get closer to it from the current position (3, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's current position (3, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are trying to reach (3, 1), we need to find an empty space that brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Consider the constraints
Moving directly to the goal is not possible because there is a wall at (3, 2) blocking the path. However, we can see that the goal is just two spaces away from our current position, but we cannot move directly due to the wall.

## Step 5: Determine the best move
Given the constraints, we realize that we made a mistake in our previous moves by not considering the wall at (3, 2) more carefully. We should have aimed to move around this wall earlier. However, from our current position, we cannot move closer to the goal without going around the wall, which would involve moving away from the goal first.

## Step 6: Reconsider the strategy
Given the layout and the goal, a more direct approach is blocked by the wall. We need to find an alternative route that goes around the wall. However, from our current position, going around the wall would involve moving to a position that is further away from the goal, which seems counterintuitive.

## Step 7: Final decision
Given the constraints and the goal, we realize that we are stuck and cannot move closer to the goal without going around the wall. However, I should have noticed that moving to (2, 2) or other nearby empty spaces doesn't provide a clear path to the goal. The correct approach would be to admit that we cannot reach the goal from our current position without backtracking or having more flexibility in movement, which is not considered in our current strategy.

However, considering the format and the requirement for a final answer, and acknowledging the oversight in my analysis that led to this point without a clear path forward, the most appropriate action would be to select a move that was not directly analyzed in the steps due to the realization of the mistake in the approach.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (2, 2), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position which is now considered empty.

The goal remains at position (3, 1), and we need to find a way to get closer to it from the current position (2, 2).

## Step 6: Choose the next move
However, considering the goal is at (3, 1) and there's a wall at (3, 2), moving to (3, 3) doesn't directly help. But since we've already established that moving to (3, 3) is the closest we can get to the goal's x-coordinate, we should reconsider how to approach the goal from this position.

## Step 7: Reconsider the strategy
Given the layout and the goal, a more direct approach would involve finding a way to move around the wall at (3, 2) or finding an alternative route that could lead to the goal more efficiently.

## Step 8: Final decision
Given the constraints and the goal, we should aim to move closer to the goal or find a position that offers more flexibility for the next move. However, my analysis led to a point where the direct move to achieve this isn't clear without reconsidering the entire path or having more flexibility in movement.

However, I should have noticed that I previously moved to (3, 3) and then back to (2, 2) without a clear plan to reach the goal. Given the format and the requirement for a final answer, and acknowledging the oversight in my analysis that led to this point without a clear path forward, the most appropriate action would be to select a move that was not directly analyzed in the steps due to the realization of the mistake in the approach.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a zigzag or a winding path, but it's more accurately described as an "L" shape with an additional corridor connected to it, forming an overall shape that can be considered as a variant of an "L" shape or a "bent" shape.

## Step 2: Determine the correct classification of the shape
Given the complexity of the shape, it's more accurate to describe it as a "bent" or "angled" shape rather than a simple geometric shape like a straight line, L-shape, or U-shape. However, if we simplify the classification, we can consider it as a variant of an "L" shape.

## Step 3: Generate a new maze with the same shape
To generate a new maze with the same shape, we need to create a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces that form an "L" shape with an additional corridor connected to it.

## Step 4: Create the new maze
Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

## Step 5: Verify the new maze
The new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form an "L" shape with an additional corridor connected to it, which is recognizable as the same general shape as the original maze.

The final answer is: 
(1) L-shape (or bent/angled shape)
(2) Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)
