You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and goal
The player is currently at position (4, 3), and the goal is to reach position (3, 1).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (4, 3), we need to look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), and (4, 2). Since we can move in any of the eight directions, we need to find which of these empty spaces is closest to the goal (3, 1) and is reachable from our current position.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Looking at the empty spaces, moving directly towards the goal is not possible since it's blocked by walls. However, we can move to (3, 3), which is closer to the goal and is an empty space adjacent to our current position.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
The next move should be to position (3, 3) as it is the closest we can get to the goal while following the rules of movement through empty spaces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (3, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position (4, 3) which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), and we need to find a way to get closer to it from the current position (3, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's current position (3, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are trying to reach (3, 1), we need to find a move that gets us closer to this position.

## Step 4: Consider diagonal and orthogonal moves
Since we can move in any of the eight directions, we should consider both diagonal and orthogonal (up, down, left, right) moves. However, the direct path to the goal is blocked by a wall at (3, 2), so we need to find an alternative route.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the constraints, moving to (2, 3) seems like a viable option as it keeps us close to the goal's column and allows for potential future moves towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (2, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), and we need to find a way to get closer to it from the current position (2, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's current position (2, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are trying to reach (3, 1), we need to find a move that gets us closer to this position.

## Step 4: Consider diagonal and orthogonal moves
Since we can move in any of the eight directions, we should consider both diagonal and orthogonal (up, down, left, right) moves. Moving diagonally to (3, 2) is not possible because it's a wall, but moving to (2, 2) could bring us closer to the goal by potentially allowing a future diagonal move.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the constraints, moving to (2, 2) seems like the best option as it keeps us flexible for future moves and gets us closer to the goal's column.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Since we can move in any of the eight directions, we should consider both diagonal and orthogonal (up, down, left, right) moves. Moving directly to (3, 1) is not possible because it's blocked by a wall at (3, 2) for a direct move and by a wall at (2, 1) for a diagonal move. However, moving diagonally to (3, 3) could bring us closer to the goal by potentially allowing a future move down to the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the constraints, moving to (3, 3) seems like the best option as it gets us closer to the goal and keeps us flexible for future moves.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a zigzag or a winding path. However, upon closer inspection, it can be observed that the empty spaces form a rough outline of a diagonal line from the top-right to the bottom-left of the maze, with some deviations. A more fitting description would be that the empty spaces form a "staircase" shape, with alternating steps going up and down.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and a valid path from P to G that forms the same staircase shape
To create a new maze, we need to ensure that it has the same size as the original (5x5), includes a valid path from P to G, and forms the same staircase shape with its empty spaces.

## Step 3: Define the walls and empty spaces for the new maze
Let's define the walls and empty spaces for the new maze. We'll place the player position (P) at (4, 0) and the goal position (G) at (0, 4).

## Step 4: Specify the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (0, 4)

The final answer is: 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (0, 4)
