You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and goal
The player is currently at position (4, 3), and the goal is to reach position (3, 1).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (4, 3), we need to look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), and (4, 2). Since we can move in any of the eight directions, we need to find which of these empty spaces is closest to the goal (3, 1) and is reachable from our current position.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Looking at the empty spaces, moving directly towards the goal is not possible since it's blocked by walls. However, we can move to (3, 3), which is closer to the goal and is an empty space adjacent to our current position.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
The next move should be to position (3, 3) as it is the closest we can get to the goal given the constraints of the maze and our current position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (3, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position (4, 3) which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), and we need to find a way to get closer to it from our new position (3, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's current position (3, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are trying to reach (3, 1), we need to find an empty space that brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Consider the constraints
Moving directly to the goal is not possible because there is a wall at (3, 2) blocking our path. We need to find an alternative route.

## Step 5: Determine the best move
Given the constraints, moving to (2, 3) or (2, 2) could potentially bring us closer to the goal by allowing us to navigate around the wall at (3, 2). However, (2, 2) is closer to the goal in terms of horizontal movement, which is our priority since the goal is directly to our left.

## Step 6: Choose the next move
The next move should be to position (2, 2) as it offers a potential path around the wall blocking our direct path to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the new position
The player is now at position (2, 2), which is closer to the goal but still requires navigating around the wall at (3, 2) to reach (3, 1).

## Step 2: Evaluate the options
Given the current position and the goal, we need to find a way to move closer to the goal. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). However, none of these directly help us get around the wall at (3, 2) to reach the goal.

## Step 3: Consider a strategic move
Since we cannot move directly towards the goal due to the wall, we need to think strategically. Moving to (2, 3) does not bring us closer to the goal but moving to (1, 3) would actually take us further away. Our best option is to try and find a way to navigate the wall by moving in a way that sets us up for a future move.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Given the constraints and our strategic considerations, moving to (2, 3) is not ideal but it's the only move that doesn't take us further away from the goal and keeps our options open for the next move. However, upon reevaluation, considering the goal is to reach (3, 1) and there's a wall at (3, 2), we might need to reconsider our approach entirely.

## Step 5: Reconsider the approach
Given the wall at (3, 2) and our goal at (3, 1), and our current position at (2, 2), we actually need to think about moving to a position that would allow us to reach the goal by moving around the wall. However, the maze's constraints and our analysis show that we've reached a point where we must acknowledge the oversight in our initial strategy.

## Step 6: Correct the strategy
Upon further reflection, we realize that our analysis missed considering the full implications of the maze's layout on our movement strategy. Given the direct path to the goal is blocked and our current position, we should focus on finding an alternative route that effectively bypasses the wall. However, the current setup indicates a challenge in directly applying this strategy without a clear path.

## Step 7: Realize the limitation
Given the maze's layout and the rules of movement, we are constrained in our ability to reach the goal directly due to the placement of walls. Our analysis indicates that we've pursued a logical path but may have reached a limit in our approach given the constraints.

## Step 8: Final assessment
Upon a thorough assessment, it appears that we've reached a point where acknowledging the challenge in the current approach is necessary. The direct and indirect paths to the goal are heavily constrained by the walls, necessitating a reevaluation of possible moves within the rules provided.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a diagonal line or a staircase from the top-right to the bottom-left, but with a specific configuration that allows movement from the start to the goal. However, upon closer inspection, it's more accurate to describe the shape as an "L" shape or a corner shape, considering the arrangement of empty spaces that facilitate movement from the player's position to the goal.

## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same general shape.
To create a new maze, we need to ensure it's the same size (5x5) and has walls, empty spaces, a player position, and a goal position. The empty spaces should form an "L" shape or a similar corner shape to facilitate movement.

## Step 3: Design the new maze.
Given the constraints and the need to form an "L" shape with the empty spaces, we can strategically place walls and empty spaces to create a path from the player to the goal while ensuring the maze is not an identical copy of the original.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze.
The new maze will have the same format as the original, listing walls, empty spaces, the player's position, and the goal position.

## Step 5: Finalize the new maze details.
After designing the new maze, we can finalize the positions of the walls, empty spaces, the player, and the goal.

The final answer is:

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces is an "L" shape or a corner shape.

(2) New Maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)
