You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

The player is currently at (4, 3), and the goal is at (3, 1). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to determine the next move.

The adjacent empty spaces to (4, 3) are:

* (4, 2)
* (3, 3)

Since the goal is at (3, 1), I will move towards the empty space that is closer to the goal. In this case, I will move to (3, 3).

Next move: (3, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position, and I will continue to solve the maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to determine the next move.

The adjacent empty spaces to (3, 3) are:

* (2, 3)
* (2, 2)
* (4, 3)

Since the goal is at (3, 1), I will move towards the empty space that is closer to the goal. In this case, I will move to (2, 3) and then try to move towards the goal from there, but I notice that (2, 2) is also a good option as it is closer to the column of the goal. However, I will choose (2, 3) for now.

Next move: (2, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position, and I will continue to solve the maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to determine the next move.

The adjacent empty spaces to (2, 3) are:

* (1, 3)
* (2, 2)
* (3, 3)

Since the goal is at (3, 1), I will move towards the empty space that is closer to the goal. In this case, I will move to (2, 2) because it is closer to the column of the goal.

Next move: (2, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position, and I will continue to solve the maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to determine the next move.

However, I notice that there are no adjacent empty spaces that are closer to the goal. The goal is at (3, 1), but there is a wall at (2, 1) and (3, 2) that blocks my path.

In this case, I will move to an empty space that will allow me to potentially move closer to the goal in the next step. I will move to (3, 3) and then try to find a way to move down to the goal.

Next move: (3, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position, and I will continue to solve the maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to determine the next move.

However, I notice that there are no adjacent empty spaces that are closer to the goal. But I also notice that I am in the same column as the goal, and the goal is two spaces down from my current position.

Unfortunately, I am blocked by a wall at (3, 2) and I don't have a direct path to the goal. But I can try to move around the wall by going back to a previous position and then trying to find an alternative path.

In this case, I will move to (2, 3) and then try to find a way to move down to the goal.

Next move: (2, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position, and I will continue to solve the maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to determine the next move.

I notice that I can move to (2, 2) and then try to find a way to move down to the goal.

Next move: (2, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position, and I will continue to solve the maze.

However, I realize that I've been to this position before, and I didn't find a way to reach the goal from here. I'll need to think of a different approach.

Let me re-examine the maze and think of a new plan.

Ah, I have an idea! I can try to move to (1, 3) and then see if I can find a way to move down to the goal.

Next move: (1, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position, and I will continue to solve the maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to determine the next move.

However, I notice that there are no adjacent empty spaces that are closer to the goal. I'm blocked by walls on three sides, and the only empty space I can move to is (2, 3).

But I've been to (2, 3) before, and I didn't find a way to reach the goal from there. I need to think of a different approach.

Let me re-examine the maze and think of a new plan.

Ah, I have an idea! I can try to move to (2, 3) and then to (2, 2), but I've tried that before. Instead, I'll try to move to (2, 3) and then see if I can find a way to move down to the goal.

However, I notice that I've been moving around in circles, and I'm not getting closer to the goal. I need to think of a completely new approach.

Let me re-examine the maze and think of a new plan.

Ah, I have an idea! I can try to move to the other side of the maze and then see if I can find a way to move up to the goal.

Next move: (2, 3) is not a good option, so I'll try to move to the other side of the maze. I'll move to (4, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position, and I will continue to solve the maze.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "staircase" or a "zigzag" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same staircase or zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as a staircase or zigzag shape.
