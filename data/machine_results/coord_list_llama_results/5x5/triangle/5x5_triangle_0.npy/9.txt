You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and goal
The player is currently at position (4, 3), and the goal is to reach position (3, 1).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (4, 3), we need to look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), and (4, 2). Since we can move in any of the eight directions, we need to find which of these empty spaces is closest to the goal (3, 1) and is reachable from our current position.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Looking at the empty spaces, moving directly towards the goal is not possible since it's blocked by walls. However, we can move to (3, 3), which is closer to the goal and is an empty space adjacent to our current position.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
The next move should be to (3, 3) because it is the closest empty space to the goal that we can reach from our current position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (3, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position (4, 3) which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Identify the goal and current position again
The goal remains at (3, 1), and the player is now at (3, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the new position (3, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). We need to find which of these empty spaces is closest to the goal (3, 1) and is reachable from our current position.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Since we are at (3, 3) and the goal is at (3, 1), we need to move closer to the goal. However, there are walls blocking direct horizontal movement to the goal. The closest we can get to the goal by moving through empty spaces is by moving diagonally or vertically and then horizontally if possible. Given the layout, moving to (2, 3) or (2, 2) could be options, but since (2, 2) is closer to the goal in terms of horizontal movement and is reachable, it's a better choice.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
The next move should be to (2, 2) because it is closer to the goal, reachable, and sets up for a potential move closer to the goal in the next step.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (2, 2), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position which is not relevant for determining the next move.

## Step 2: Identify the goal and current position again
The goal remains at (3, 1), and the player is now at (2, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the new position (2, 2), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). We need to find which of these empty spaces is closest to the goal (3, 1) and is reachable from our current position.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Since we are at (2, 2) and the goal is at (3, 1), moving directly to the goal is blocked by a wall at (3, 2) for a direct diagonal move and by a wall at (2, 1) for a direct horizontal move followed by a vertical move. However, we can move to (3, 3) which is closer to the goal in terms of vertical alignment and sets up a potential path to navigate around the walls to reach the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
The next move should be to (3, 3) because it aligns vertically with the goal, is reachable, and provides a setup for a future move that could bring us closer to the goal by navigating around the blocking walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (3, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position which is not relevant for determining the next move.

## Step 2: Identify the goal and current position again
The goal remains at (3, 1), and the player is now at (3, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the new position (3, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). We need to find which of these empty spaces is closest to the goal (3, 1) and is reachable from our current position.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Since we are at (3, 3) and the goal is at (3, 1), moving directly down to the goal is the most straightforward path. However, since we can only move to empty spaces, and there are no empty spaces directly between our current position and the goal due to the wall at (3, 2), we must consider alternative routes. Given the layout, moving to (2, 3) could be an option to navigate around the wall blocking our path.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
However, upon closer inspection, moving to (2, 3) does not directly help in reaching the goal due to the wall at (2, 1) and other walls blocking a straightforward path. Since we are already at (3, 3) and our previous analysis missed the direct approach due to overcomplication, we should reconsider our position relative to the goal and the maze's constraints. Given the direct path is blocked, and our analysis did not correctly identify a viable alternative that moves closer to the goal, we must acknowledge the oversight and directly address the goal's reachability from our current position, considering the maze's layout might require a more nuanced approach than initially analyzed.

## Step 6: Reevaluate the approach to the goal
Given the direct vertical path from (3, 3) to (3, 1) is blocked by a wall at (3, 2), and our analysis of moving to (2, 3) does not facilitate a direct path to the goal due to other blocking walls, the correct approach involves recognizing the limitations of our current analysis and acknowledging that without a direct path or an evident alternative route through the empty spaces, we must reconsider the maze's layout for any overlooked paths or strategies that could facilitate reaching the goal from our current position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (2, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position which is not relevant for determining the next move.

## Step 2: Identify the goal and current position again
The goal remains at (3, 1), and the player is now at (2, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the new position (2, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). We need to find which of these empty spaces is closest to the goal (3, 1) and is reachable from our current position.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Since we are at (2, 3) and the goal is at (3, 1), moving to (2, 2) is the most logical step as it brings us closer to the goal in terms of horizontal alignment and provides a potential setup for navigating around the walls to reach the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
The next move should be to (2, 2) because it aligns horizontally closer to the goal, is reachable, and sets up a potential path to navigate around the blocking walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (2, 2), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position which is not relevant for determining the next move.

## Step 2: Identify the goal and current position again
The goal remains at (3, 1), and the player is now at (2, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the new position (2, 2), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). We need to find which of these empty spaces is closest to the goal (3, 1) and is reachable from our current position.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Since we are at (2, 2) and the goal is at (3, 1), moving to (3, 3) is not the most direct approach, but given the constraints of the maze, moving to an empty space that is closer to the goal in terms of vertical alignment could be beneficial. However, considering the direct approach to the goal is blocked by a wall at (3, 2) for vertical movement and a wall at (2, 1) for horizontal movement, we must find an alternative.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Upon reevaluation, considering the maze's constraints and the goal's position relative to our current position, it becomes apparent that a more direct path or a viable alternative route through the empty spaces to the goal is not immediately available without navigating through the walls, which is not permissible. Therefore, acknowledging the oversight in our approach and the limitations imposed by the maze's layout, we must reconsider our strategy for reaching the goal from our current position.

## Step 6: Reconsider the strategy
Given the direct paths are blocked, and our analysis did not correctly identify a viable alternative that moves closer to the goal, we must accept that without a direct path or an evident alternative route through the empty spaces, our analysis has limitations. However, since we must provide a move, moving to (3, 3) becomes the next logical step as it was previously identified as a potential move, despite not being the most direct approach to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (3, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position which is not relevant for determining the next move.

## Step 2: Identify the goal and current position again
The goal remains at (3, 1), and the player is now at (3, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the new position (3, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). We need to find which of these empty spaces is closest to the goal (3, 1) and is reachable from our current position.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Since we are at (3, 3) and the goal is at (3, 1), and given the constraints of the maze with walls blocking direct horizontal and vertical paths to the goal, we realize that we are actually at a position where moving directly to the goal is not possible due to the wall at (3, 2).

## Step 5: Choose the next move
However, upon closer inspection, we see that moving to (2, 3) or other empty spaces does not bring us closer to the goal in a meaningful way given the maze's layout. Since we are directly above the goal but blocked by a wall, and our analysis did not provide a viable alternative route, we acknowledge the limitation of our approach.

## Step 6: Realize the limitation
Given the maze's layout and the rules of movement, we are actually unable to move closer to the goal from our current position without going through walls, which is not allowed. This realization means that our approach to finding a path to the goal has reached a point where, based on the provided information and the maze's constraints, we cannot proceed in a way that brings us closer to the goal without violating the rules of movement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Since we are at (2, 3) and the goal is at (3, 1), moving to (2, 2) is the most logical step as it brings us closer to the goal in terms of horizontal alignment and provides a potential setup for navigating around the walls to reach the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
The next move should be to (2, 2) because it aligns horizontally closer to the goal, is reachable, and sets up a potential path to navigate around the blocking walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Since we are at (2, 2) and the goal is at (3, 1), we are actually very close to the goal but blocked by a wall at (2, 1) for direct horizontal movement and a wall at (3, 2) for direct vertical movement followed by horizontal movement.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
However, given the constraints and the available empty spaces, there isn't a move that directly brings us closer to the goal without going through walls, which is not allowed. The realization that we cannot proceed in a meaningful way towards the goal without violating the movement rules indicates a limitation in our approach given the maze's layout.

## Step 6: Realize the limitation
Given the maze's layout and the rules of movement, we are actually unable to move closer to the goal from our current position without going through walls, which is not allowed.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that can be described as a "staircase" or more specifically, a "zigzag" or "meandering" path, but given the context and the overall structure, it might be more accurate to describe it as forming a "rectangle" with extensions or a "U-shape" with additional paths. However, the most fitting description considering the overall layout and the nature of the path from the player's position to the goal would be a "meandering path" or simply a "zigzag". For simplicity and clarity, we'll refer to it as a "zigzag" path.

## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same general shape.
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it's the same size as the original (5x5), includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original, and its empty spaces form a "zigzag" shape.

## Step 3: Design the new maze.
Given the constraints and the goal to replicate the "zigzag" shape, we can design a new maze by rearranging the walls and empty spaces while ensuring a path exists from a new player position to a new goal position.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze.
The new maze will have the same format as the original, with walls, empty spaces, a player position, and a goal position.

## Step 5: Finalize the new maze design.
After designing and ensuring the new maze meets all criteria, we can present it as follows:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

The final answer is: 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)
