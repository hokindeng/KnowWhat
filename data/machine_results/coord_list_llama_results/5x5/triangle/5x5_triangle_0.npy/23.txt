You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player position (4, 3) to the goal position (3, 1) while avoiding walls and only moving through empty spaces.

Given the current player position (4, 3) and the available empty spaces, the next move should be to an adjacent empty space that brings us closer to the goal or at least does not move us further away.

The empty spaces are: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2).

From the player's current position (4, 3), the most logical next move would be to (3, 3) because it is adjacent and directly closer to the goal position (3, 1).

Therefore, the coordinates of the next move are: (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the current player position (3, 3), we need to find a path to the goal position (3, 1).

Since we are already at the correct row (y-coordinate = 3), we need to move left to reach the goal. However, there is a wall at (3, 2), which blocks our direct path to the goal.

We need to find an alternative route. Looking at the empty spaces, we can move diagonally up-left to (2, 2), which would bring us closer to the goal and potentially allow us to navigate around the wall.

Therefore, the coordinates of the next move are: (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the current player position (2, 2), we need to find a path to the goal position (3, 1).

Since we are above the goal and there is a wall at (2, 1) and (3, 0), we cannot move directly down or left to reach the goal. However, we can move down to (3, 2) but that is a wall, or we can move diagonally down-left, but that would put us in a wall as well.

We can move right to (2, 3) which is an empty space and then try to find a path from there.

Therefore, the coordinates of the next move are: (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the current player position (2, 3), we need to find a path to the goal position (3, 1).

Since we are above the goal and there is a wall at (2, 1) and (3, 0), and also a wall at (3, 2), we cannot move directly down or left to reach the goal. However, we can move down to (3, 3) which is an empty space and then try to find a path from there.

Therefore, the coordinates of the next move are: (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the current player position (3, 3), we need to find a path to the goal position (3, 1).

Since we are at the same row as the goal and there is a wall at (3, 2), we cannot move directly left to reach the goal. However, we can move diagonally up-left to (2, 2) which is an empty space, and then try to find a path from there.

But we already know that moving to (2, 2) and then trying to find a path from there doesn't lead to a straightforward solution. 

Let's try to think of another possible move. We can move up to (2, 3) but that would put us in a position we already were, and we didn't find a solution from there.

Wait, we can move diagonally up-left to (2, 2) and then we can move diagonally down-left from (2, 2) to the goal (3, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "staircase" or a "zigzag" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar staircase shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form a staircase shape, similar to the original maze.
