You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will analyze the given information and plan a step-by-step path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Current player position: (4, 3)
Goal position: (3, 1)

Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), I will look for the closest empty space that brings me closer to the goal.

From the current position (4, 3), I can see that the closest empty space that moves me closer to the goal is (3, 3), which is diagonally up and left.

Next move: (3, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3, 3), I need to move closer to the goal (3, 1). Since I'm already at the correct x-coordinate (3), I just need to move down the y-coordinate.

However, I notice that there's a wall at (3, 2), which blocks my direct path to the goal. I need to find an alternative route.

Looking at the empty spaces, I see that I can move to (2, 3) or (2, 2). Moving to (2, 3) wouldn't bring me closer to the goal, but moving to (2, 2) could potentially allow me to move around the wall and get closer to the goal.

Next move: (2, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2, 2), I need to move closer to the goal (3, 1). Since I'm blocked by the wall at (3, 2) and (2, 1), I need to find an alternative route.

I notice that I can move to (2, 3), but that wouldn't bring me closer to the goal. However, I also see that I can move to (1, 3), which could potentially allow me to move around the wall and get closer to the goal.

But wait, I also see that I can move to (3, 3) and then try to find a way to move down to the goal. Since I was already at (3, 3) previously, I know that I can move from there to (2, 2), but I didn't explore other options from that position.

Let me try to move to (3, 3) and then see if I can find a way to move down to the goal.

Next move: (3, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at position (3, 3), I need to find a way to move down to the goal (3, 1). Since I'm blocked by the wall at (3, 2), I need to find an alternative route.

I notice that I can move to (2, 3) or (2, 2), but I've already explored those options. I also see that I can move to (4, 3), but that wouldn't bring me closer to the goal.

However, I also see that I can move to (4, 2), and then potentially move to (4, 1), and then maybe find a way to move to the goal.

But wait, I also see that I can move to (4, 1) directly from (3, 3) diagonally, and then try to find a way to move to the goal.

Let me try to move to (4, 1) and then see if I can find a way to move to the goal.

Next move: (4, 1)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "staircase" or a "zigzag" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same staircase or zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a staircase or zigzag shape, similar to the original maze. However, it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
