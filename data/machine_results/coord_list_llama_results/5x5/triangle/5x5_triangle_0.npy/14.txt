You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (4, 3), and the adjacent empty spaces are (3, 3), (4, 2).

Since the goal position is (3, 1), I will move to the empty space that is closest to the goal. In this case, I will move to (3, 3).

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 3), I need to find a way to get closer to the goal (3, 1). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. Unfortunately, there are no empty spaces directly adjacent to (3, 3) that are closer to the goal.

However, I can move to (2, 3) or (2, 2), which are both empty spaces that might lead me to the goal eventually. Since (2, 2) is slightly closer to the goal, I will move to (2, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 2), I need to find a way to get closer to the goal (3, 1). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. Unfortunately, there are no empty spaces directly adjacent to (2, 2) that are closer to the goal.

However, I can move to (2, 3) or try to find another path. Since moving to (2, 3) doesn't seem to lead me closer to the goal, I will try to find another path. I notice that I can move to (1, 3), which might lead me to a path that gets me closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1, 3), I need to find a way to get closer to the goal (3, 1). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. Unfortunately, there are no empty spaces directly adjacent to (1, 3) that are closer to the goal.

However, I can move to (2, 3) or (2, 2), which are both empty spaces that might lead me to the goal eventually. Since (2, 2) is slightly closer to the goal, I will move to (2, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 2)

Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've been here before! Now that I'm back at (2, 2), I need to think of a different approach. I will examine the adjacent empty spaces again. I can move to (2, 3) or try to find another path.

However, I notice that I can also move to (3, 3), which is an empty space that is closer to the goal. From there, I might be able to find a way to move down to (3, 1).

Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 3), I'm close to the goal, but I need to find a way to move down to (3, 1). Unfortunately, there's a wall at (3, 2), so I need to find a way around it.

I notice that I can move to (4, 3), (4, 2), or (4, 1), and then try to find a way to move back to the goal. Since (4, 1) is the closest to the goal, I will move to (4, 1).

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "staircase" or a "zigzag" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same staircase shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a staircase shape that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it has a similar structure and shape.
