You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and goal
The player is currently at position (4, 3), and the goal is to reach position (3, 1).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (4, 3), we need to look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), and (4, 2). Since we can move in any of the eight directions, we need to find which of these empty spaces is closest to the goal (3, 1) and is reachable from our current position.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Looking at the empty spaces, moving directly towards the goal is not possible since it's blocked by walls. However, we can move to (3, 3), which is closer to the goal and is an empty space adjacent to our current position.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the best next move is to (3, 3) because it moves us closer to the goal and is a valid move within the maze's rules.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (3, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position (4, 3) which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), and we need to find a way to get closer to it from the current position (3, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's current position (3, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are trying to reach (3, 1), we need to find a move that gets us closer to this position.

## Step 4: Consider the constraints
Moving directly to (3, 1) is not possible because (3, 2) is a wall. Therefore, we need to find an alternative route that avoids walls and gets us closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Determine the best move
Given the constraints, the best move would be to (2, 3) because it allows us to potentially move around the wall at (3, 2) and get closer to the goal in subsequent moves.

## Step 6: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the best next move is to (2, 3) as it provides a path towards the goal while avoiding walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (2, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), and we need to find a way to get closer to it from the current position (2, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's current position (2, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are trying to reach (3, 1), we need to find a move that gets us closer to this position.

## Step 4: Consider the constraints
Moving directly to (3, 1) is still not possible because (3, 2) is a wall and (2, 1) is also a wall. However, we can move to (2, 2) which gets us closer to the goal in one of the few available paths.

## Step 5: Determine the best move
Given the constraints, the best move would be to (2, 2) because it allows us to potentially move around the walls and get closer to the goal in subsequent moves.

## Step 6: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the best next move is to (2, 2) as it provides a path towards the goal while avoiding walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (2, 2), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), and we need to find a way to get closer to it from the current position (2, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's current position (2, 2), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are trying to reach (3, 1), we need to find a move that gets us closer to this position.

## Step 4: Consider the constraints
Moving directly to (3, 1) is still not possible because (3, 2) is a wall and (2, 1) is also a wall. However, we can move to (3, 3) which gets us closer to the goal in one of the few available paths and potentially sets up a move around the wall at (3, 2).

## Step 5: Determine the best move
Given the constraints, the best move would be to (3, 3) because it allows us to potentially move around the wall and get closer to the goal in subsequent moves.

## Step 6: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the best next move is to (3, 3) as it provides a path towards the goal while avoiding walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (3, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), and we need to find a way to get closer to it from the current position (3, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's current position (3, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are trying to reach (3, 1), we need to find a move that gets us closer to this position.

## Step 4: Consider the constraints
Moving directly to (3, 1) is not possible because (3, 2) is a wall. However, we can't move closer to the goal in the current column because of the wall. We have to consider moving to a different column and then try to get closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Determine the best move
Given the constraints, the best move would be to (2, 3) or (4, 3) as both allow us to potentially move around the wall and get closer to the goal in subsequent moves. However, moving to (2, 3) would put us further away from the goal column, whereas moving to (4, 3) doesn't provide an immediate advantage in terms of getting closer to the goal. Since we were at (2, 3) previously and it didn't lead to a straightforward solution, we should try a different path.

## Step 6: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the best next move is to (2, 3) is not ideal, so we should consider (4, 3) as an alternative to try and find a different path to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

## Step 4: Consider the constraints
Moving directly to (3, 1) is not possible because (3, 2) is a wall and we are not in the same column. However, we can move to (4, 2) or (4, 1) which gets us closer to the goal column.

## Step 5: Determine the best move
Given the constraints, the best move would be to (4, 2) or (4, 1) as both allow us to get closer to the goal column. Moving to (4, 1) would put us in a better position to potentially move to the goal in subsequent moves.

## Step 6: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the best next move is to (4, 1) as it provides a path towards the goal while avoiding walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  1\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a zigzag or a winding path, but it's more accurately described as an "L" shape with an additional corridor connected to it, forming an overall shape that can be considered as a variant of an "L" shape with an extension.

## Step 2: Determine the correct classification of the shape
Given the complexity and the specific configuration of the empty spaces, the shape can be more generally classified as a "zigzag" or a "winding path," but these terms don't precisely capture the shape's characteristics. However, for simplicity and due to the primary feature of the shape, we can consider it as an extended "L" shape.

## Step 3: Generate a new maze with the same size and shape of empty spaces
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it has the same size (5x5), includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an extended "L" shape.

## Step 4: Design the new maze
The new maze will have walls and empty spaces rearranged to form a different but recognizable "L" shape with an extension, ensuring there's a path from the player's position (P) to the goal (G).

## Step 5: Encode the new maze
Using the same format as the original, the new maze is encoded as follows:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

The final answer is: 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)
