You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (4, 3), and the adjacent empty spaces are (3, 3), (4, 2).

Since the goal position is (3, 1), I will move to the empty space that is closest to the goal. In this case, I will move to (3, 3).

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. The adjacent empty spaces are (2, 3), (2, 2), and (4, 3).

Since the goal position is (3, 1), I will move to the empty space that is closest to the goal. In this case, I will move to (2, 3) and then try to move closer to the goal from there, but I notice that (2, 2) is also a good option as it is closer to the goal in terms of horizontal distance.

However, I will choose (2, 3) for now, as it provides more flexibility for the next move.

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. The adjacent empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), and (3, 3).

Since the goal position is (3, 1), I will move to the empty space that is closest to the goal. In this case, I will move to (2, 2), as it is closer to the goal in terms of horizontal distance and also provides a possible path to move down to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. However, I notice that there are no adjacent empty spaces that I can move to. The space below me, (3, 2), is a wall, and the space to my right, (2, 3), is an empty space, but it would take me away from the goal.

Since I'm stuck, I will try to move to a position that will allow me to get closer to the goal. I will move to (1, 3), which is the only available option that might provide a future path to the goal.

However, I notice that this move might not be the most efficient, and I might need to backtrack later.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 3)

Please note that this move is not ideal, and I might need to adjust my strategy later.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. However, I notice that there are no adjacent empty spaces that I can move to that would bring me closer to the goal. The space above me is a wall, and the space to my right is also a wall.

Since I'm stuck, I will backtrack to a previous position that might provide a better path to the goal. I will move to (2, 3), which is an empty space that I previously visited.

From there, I can try to find a new path to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. The adjacent empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), and (3, 3).

Since the goal position is (3, 1), I will move to the empty space that is closest to the goal. In this case, I will move to (2, 2), as it is closer to the goal in terms of horizontal distance and also provides a possible path to move down to the goal.

However, I've already been to (2, 2) before, and I know that moving down from there is blocked by a wall. So, I will try to move to (3, 3) instead, which might provide a new path to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. However, I notice that there are no adjacent empty spaces that I can move to, except for the ones that I previously visited.

But I also notice that the goal position (3, 1) is now adjacent to my current position, and the only thing blocking me is the wall at (3, 2). However, I can try to move around the wall by going back to a previous position and then moving down.

Wait, I can actually move directly to the goal position by going left! I apologize for not noticing this earlier.

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 1)

I hope this is the correct solution!

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "staircase" or a "zigzag" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same staircase shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a staircase or zigzag shape.
