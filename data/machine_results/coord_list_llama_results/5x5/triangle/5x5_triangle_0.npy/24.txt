You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position (4, 3) to the goal position (3, 1) while avoiding walls and only moving through empty spaces.

Given the current player position is (4, 3), and looking at the empty spaces, the closest empty space that we can move to, which would bring us closer to the goal, is (3, 3). This is because moving to (3, 3) reduces the distance to the goal and keeps us on a path that avoids walls.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move would be (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we are at (3, 3), we need to find a way to get closer to the goal (3, 1). Since we can move diagonally, the most direct path would be to move to (2, 2), which is an empty space. This move gets us closer to the goal and avoids walls.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move would be (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we are at (2, 2), we need to find a way to get closer to the goal (3, 1). Since we can't move directly to the goal due to the wall at (3, 2) and (2, 1), we need to find an alternative path.

A possible move is to go to (2, 3), which is an empty space. This move doesn't get us directly closer to the goal, but it sets us up for a potential future move that could get us closer.

However, a better option would be to try to get closer to the goal by moving to a position that could potentially allow us to move to the goal in the next step. Since we can move diagonally, we can try to move to a position that is diagonally adjacent to the goal.

Unfortunately, there is no empty space that is diagonally adjacent to the goal. Therefore, we will have to move to (2, 3) and then try to find a way to get closer to the goal from there.

The coordinates of my next move would be (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we are at (2, 3), we need to find a way to get closer to the goal (3, 1). Since we can move diagonally, we can try to move to a position that is closer to the goal.

A possible move is to go to (3, 3), which is an empty space. This move gets us closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate, and from there, we can try to find a way to move down to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move would be (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we are at (3, 3), we need to find a way to get to the goal (3, 1). Since we are already at the correct x-coordinate, we just need to move down to the correct y-coordinate.

However, there is a wall at (3, 2), so we can't move directly down to the goal. We need to find an alternative path.

Unfortunately, there is no empty space that we can move to that would get us closer to the goal. We are stuck.

Wait, we can move to (2, 3) and then to (2, 2) and then try to find a way to the goal from there, but that would be going back to a previous position.

After re-examining the maze, I realized that we can actually move to (2, 3) and then to (1, 3) and then try to find a way to the goal from there.

But, there is a better option, we can move to (4, 3) and then to (4, 1) and then try to find a way to the goal from there.

The coordinates of my next move would be (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we are at (4, 3), we need to find a way to get to the goal (3, 1). Since we can move diagonally, we can try to move to a position that is closer to the goal.

A possible move is to go to (4, 1), which is an empty space. This move gets us closer to the goal in terms of the y-coordinate, and from there, we can try to find a way to move to the goal.

However, we still need to find a way to move from (4, 1) to (3, 1), which is the goal. Since we can move diagonally, we can try to move to the goal directly from (4, 1), but unfortunately, there is a wall at (3, 0) and (2, 1), so we can't move directly to the goal.

But, we can move to (4, 1) and then try to find a way to the goal from there.

The coordinates of my next move would be (4, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "staircase" or a "zigzag" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same staircase or zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as a staircase or zigzag shape. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original maze.
