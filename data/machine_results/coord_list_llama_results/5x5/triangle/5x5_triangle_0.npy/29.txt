You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and goal
The player is currently at position (4, 3), and the goal is to reach position (3, 1).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (4, 3), we need to look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), and (4, 2). Since we can move in any of the eight directions, we need to find which of these empty spaces is closest to the goal (3, 1) and is reachable from our current position.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Looking at the empty spaces, moving directly towards the goal is not possible since it involves moving through walls. However, we can move diagonally or horizontally/vertically to an empty space that brings us closer to the goal. The closest empty space to the goal that we can move to from our current position is (3, 3), as it is directly adjacent and does not require moving through any walls.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the analysis, the best next move is to position (3, 3), as it moves us closer to the goal without violating any of the maze's constraints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (3, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position (4, 3) which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), which means we need to move closer to it from our current position (3, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's current position (3, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are on the same row as the goal, we need to find a way to move closer to it horizontally.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Since we cannot move directly to the goal due to the wall at (3, 2), we need to find an alternative route. The closest we can get to the goal by moving through empty spaces is by going around the wall. However, there are no empty spaces directly adjacent to our current position that are closer to the goal. We must consider moving to a position that will allow us to approach the goal in the next move. Given the constraints, moving to (2, 3) is the best option as it sets us up for a potential move closer to the goal in the subsequent step.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the analysis, the best next move is to position (2, 3), as it prepares us for a future move closer to the goal without violating any of the maze's constraints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (2, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), which means we need to move closer to it from our current position (2, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's current position (2, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are above the goal, we need to find a way to move down and then left to reach it.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Considering the empty spaces, moving down to (3, 3) is a possibility, but it does not bring us closer to the goal in terms of the column position. However, moving diagonally down-left to an empty space that is closer to the goal is not an option because there is a wall at (3, 2). The best move is to position (2, 2) as it allows us to potentially move down and closer to the goal in the next step.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the analysis, the best next move is to position (2, 2), as it sets us up for a future move closer to the goal without violating any of the maze's constraints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (2, 2), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), which means we need to move closer to it from our current position (2, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's current position (2, 2), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are directly above the goal but one column to the right, we need to find a way to move down and left to reach it.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Considering the empty spaces and the walls, moving directly down to the goal is not possible because of the wall at (3, 2). However, moving diagonally down-left is also not an option for the same reason. The closest we can get to the goal is by moving down to (3, 3) and then reassessing our options for reaching the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the analysis, the best next move is to position (3, 3), as it brings us closer to the goal vertically and sets us up for a potential move closer to the goal in the next step.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (3, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), which means we need to move closer to it from our current position (3, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's current position (3, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are on the same row as the goal but two columns to the right, we need to find a way to move left to reach it.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Considering the empty spaces and the walls, moving directly left to the goal is not possible because of the wall at (3, 2). However, we can move to (2, 3) and then potentially down and left, or we can move to (2, 2) and then potentially down to the goal. But since we've already been to (2, 2) and (2, 3) and know that moving from there doesn't directly lead to the goal without backtracking, we need to reconsider our approach.

## Step 5: Reconsider the maze layout
Upon re-examining the maze, it becomes clear that the goal is actually trapped by walls and cannot be reached directly from any of the empty spaces without going through a wall. However, the instructions were to move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position, which includes diagonals. Given the direct path to the goal is blocked by a wall, we must consider if there's an oversight in the approach.

## Step 6: Realize the oversight
Given the maze's constraints and the goal's position, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the maze's layout or the rules provided, as the goal appears unreachable without violating the rules. However, the task requires a move within the given constraints.

## Step 7: Choose the next move based on the closest logical step
Given the analysis and the constraints, moving to a position that was previously considered might be necessary due to the maze's layout. However, this would imply backtracking or acknowledging that the goal as stated cannot be reached under the provided rules and maze layout. Since we cannot move directly to the goal due to the wall and the instructions do not allow for passing through walls, we must either reconsider the goal's reachability or find an alternative interpretation of the rules that allows for a valid move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (2, 3), and the empty spaces and walls remain the same except for the player's previous position which is now considered empty.

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), which means we need to move closer to it from our current position (2, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's current position (2, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are above the goal and one column to the right, we need to find a way to move down and left to reach it.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Considering the empty spaces and the walls, moving directly down to the goal is not possible because of the wall at (3, 2). However, we can move to (2, 2) which is closer to the goal in terms of column position and sets us up for a potential move down.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the analysis, the best next move is to position (2, 2), as it brings us closer to the goal in terms of column position and prepares us for a potential move down towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

## Step 2: Re-evaluate the goal position
The goal remains at position (3, 1), which means we need to move closer to it from our current position (2, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's current position (2, 2), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are directly above the goal but one row up, we need to find a way to move down to reach it.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Considering the empty spaces and the walls, moving directly down to the goal is possible, but since the goal is not an empty space we have listed, we must reconsider what is directly below us that is not a wall and can lead to the goal.

## Step 5: Realize the goal cannot be reached directly due to the wall at (3,2) and no empty space at (3,1) is listed, but we can move down to an empty space that is closest.
Since moving directly to the goal is not an option due to the constraints, we look for the closest empty space to the goal that we can move to. Given our current position and the layout, moving down to (3,3) does not bring us closer to the goal in terms of column position but is the closest in terms of row.

## Step 6: Choose the next move
Given the analysis, the best next move is to position (3, 3), as it brings us closer to the goal in terms of row position, even though it does not directly lead to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)

The goal remains at position (3, 1), which means we need to move closer to it from our current position (3, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the new position
Given the player's current position (3, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are on the same row as the goal but two columns to the right, we need to find a way to move left to reach it.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Considering the empty spaces and the walls, moving directly left to the goal is not possible because of the wall at (3, 2). There are no empty spaces directly adjacent to our current position that are closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Realize the goal cannot be reached directly due to the wall at (3,2) and no empty space at (3,1) is listed.
Since moving directly to the goal is not an option due to the constraints, and we've exhausted all possible moves that bring us closer to the goal, we must acknowledge that the goal cannot be reached under the given rules and maze layout.

## Step 6: Admit the goal is unreachable
Given the analysis, we conclude that the goal (3, 1) is unreachable from our current position (3, 3) or any previous position due to the constraints of the maze.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a zigzag or a winding path, but given the constraints and the layout, it's more accurate to describe it as an "L-shape" with extensions or a "staircase" with turns.

## Step 2: Determine the correct classification of the shape.
Given the complexity and the turns involved, the shape can be best described as a "staircase" with multiple turns, which makes it challenging to navigate directly from the start to the goal.

## Step 3: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same general shape.
To create a new maze, we need to ensure it has the same size (5x5), includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and forms a "staircase" shape with its empty spaces.

## Step 4: Design the new maze.
The new maze will have walls and empty spaces rearranged to form a "staircase" shape but with a different configuration than the original maze.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze.
The new maze will be encoded using the same format as the original, listing the coordinates of the walls, empty spaces, player position (P), and goal position (G).

## Step 6: Present the new maze.
Given the constraints and the need for a valid path, the new maze is designed as follows:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

The final answer is: 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)
