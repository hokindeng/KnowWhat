You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player position (4, 3) to the goal position (3, 1) while avoiding walls and only moving through empty spaces.

Given the current player position (4, 3), let's examine the adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are:

- Up: (3, 3) - This is an empty space.
- Down: Not possible since it's out of bounds.
- Left: (4, 2) - This is an empty space.
- Right: Not possible since it's out of bounds.
- Diagonals: Not immediately useful in this scenario.

The most direct path towards the goal (3, 1) from our current position would involve moving up to (3, 3), as it reduces the distance to the goal both horizontally and vertically.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move would be (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at (3, 3), let's look at the adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are:

- Up: Not possible since it's a wall at (2, 3) and (2, 4), but there is an empty space at (2, 3) diagonally up-left and (2, 2) diagonally up-left as well, however, the most direct path is not up. 
- Down: (4, 3) - This is an empty space but we just came from there.
- Left: Not directly possible since it's a wall at (3, 2), but there is an empty space at (2, 2) diagonally up-left.
- Right: Not possible since it's a wall at (3, 4).

Considering the goal is at (3, 1), moving directly left is not possible due to the wall at (3, 2). However, we can move diagonally up-left to (2, 2), which gets us closer to the goal and avoids the wall.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move would be (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at (2, 2), let's look at the adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are:

- Up: Not possible since it's a wall at (1, 2).
- Down: (3, 2) - This is a wall.
- Left: Not possible since it's a wall at (2, 1).
- Right: (2, 3) - This is an empty space.
- Diagonals: We can move diagonally down-left to (3, 1) but there is a wall at (3, 2) and a wall at (2, 1) however we can move diagonally down-right to (3, 3).

However, moving diagonally down-right to (3, 3) would not bring us closer to the goal. Moving right to (2, 3) also doesn't bring us closer to the goal directly.

Considering the goal is at (3, 1), we can actually move diagonally down-left to (3, 1) is not possible due to the wall at (3, 2) and (2, 1). However, we can move right to (2, 3) then down to (3, 3) and then left to try and reach the goal or find another path.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move would be (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at (2, 3), let's look at the adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are:

- Up: (1, 3) - This is an empty space.
- Down: (3, 3) - This is an empty space.
- Left: (2, 2) - This is an empty space, but we just came from there.
- Right: Not possible since it's a wall at (2, 4).

Considering the goal is at (3, 1), moving down to (3, 3) would bring us closer to the goal vertically, but we would still need to find a way to move left.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move would be (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at (3, 3), let's look at the adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are:

- Up: (2, 3) - This is an empty space, but we just came from there.
- Down: Not possible since it's out of bounds.
- Left: Not directly possible since it's a wall at (3, 2).
- Right: Not possible since it's a wall at (3, 4).

However, we can move diagonally up-left to (2, 2) which we already visited, or try to find another path.

Considering the goal is at (3, 1), we can actually move diagonally left to try and reach the goal but there is a wall at (3, 2). However we can move up to (2, 3) then left to (2, 2) then try to find another path to the goal.

Wait, we can actually move diagonally up-left to (2, 2) then try to move diagonally down-left to the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move would be (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at (2, 2), let's look at the adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are:

- Up: Not possible since it's a wall at (1, 2).
- Down: Not directly possible since it's a wall at (3, 2).
- Left: Not possible since it's a wall at (2, 1).
- Right: (2, 3) - This is an empty space.

However, we can move diagonally down-left to try and reach the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move would be (3, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "staircase" or "zigzag" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same staircase shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original. The empty spaces form a staircase shape, similar to the original maze.
