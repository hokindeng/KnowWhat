You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and goal
The player is currently at position (4, 3), and the goal is to reach position (3, 1).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (4, 3), we need to look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), and (4, 2). Since we can move in any of the eight directions, we need to find which of these empty spaces is closest to the goal and is a valid move from the current position.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Looking at the empty spaces, moving directly towards the goal (3, 1) from (4, 3) is not possible as it involves moving through a wall or an invalid space. However, we can move diagonally or horizontally/vertically to an adjacent empty space that brings us closer to the goal. Among the given empty spaces, moving to (3, 3) seems like the most direct path towards the goal, as it reduces the distance to the goal and is an adjacent move.

## Step 5: Confirm the move
Therefore, the best next move from the current position (4, 3) would be to (3, 3), as it is a valid move (since (3, 3) is listed as an empty space) and brings us closer to the goal position (3, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
Looking at the coordinates of the empty spaces (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), and (4, 2), we can observe that they form a shape that resembles a diagonal line or a staircase from the top-right to the bottom-left, with an additional horizontal line at the bottom. However, focusing on the main path that leads from the player's position to the goal, the shape can be simplified to a diagonal or a staircase.

## Step 2: Determine the name of the general shape
Given the diagonal or staircase-like appearance of the empty spaces, we can refer to the general shape formed by these spaces as a "staircase."

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same size and a valid path from P to G
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it has the same size as the original (5x5), includes a valid path from the player's position to the goal, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and forms a recognizable "staircase" shape with its empty spaces.

## Step 4: Design the new maze
Let's place the player's position at (4, 4) and the goal at (0, 0). A possible "staircase" path could be formed by the following empty spaces: (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 4). This path creates a diagonal staircase from the top-left to the bottom-right of the maze.

## Step 5: Define the walls of the new maze
Given the path, the remaining spaces in the 5x5 grid that are not part of the path or the player's position and goal can be considered walls. However, to ensure the maze is solvable and the path is clear, we'll focus on defining walls that do not block the path but make the maze challenging.

## Step 6: Encode the new maze
Walls can be placed at coordinates that do not interfere with the path but make the maze interesting. For simplicity, let's focus on the path and goal.

The final answer is: 
Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 0)
