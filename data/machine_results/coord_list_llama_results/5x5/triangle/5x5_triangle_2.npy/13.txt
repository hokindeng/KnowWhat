You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the current player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The current player position is (2, 2). The adjacent empty spaces are:

* (1, 3) (up-left)
* (3, 1) (down-left)
* (2, 1) is a wall, so it's not an option
* (2, 3) is a wall, so it's not an option
* (1, 2) is a wall, so it's not an option
* (3, 2) is a wall, so it's not an option
* (2, 0) is the goal, but it's not directly reachable
* (1, 1) is a wall, so it's not an option

My next move will be to (1, 3), as it is the only adjacent empty space that is not blocked by a wall.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

* (0, 3) (up)
* (0, 2) (up-left)
* (0, 4) (up-right)
* (1, 0) (left)
* (2, 2) (down-right)
* (2, 3) is a wall, so it's not an option
* (2, 4) is a wall, so it's not an option
* (1, 2) is a wall, so it's not an option
* (1, 4) is a wall, so it's not an option

My next move will be to (0, 3), as it is one of the adjacent empty spaces that is not blocked by a wall and it seems to be a good direction to move towards the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

* (0, 2) (left)
* (0, 4) (right)
* (1, 3) (down)
* (0, 0), (0, 1) are also options but moving directly down seems to be a better direction to move towards the goal

My next move will be to (1, 3), as it is one of the adjacent empty spaces that is not blocked by a wall and it seems to be a good direction to move towards the goal, and also because I've already been there, I can try to move to (1, 0) next.

However, I will move to (1, 0) directly if possible, since it's also adjacent to (0, 3) in a diagonal direction.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces in this maze also form a U-shape, similar to the original maze.
