You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I'm only asked for the next move, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best next step.

The current player position is (2, 2), and the goal is (2, 0). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: (2, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move up.
- Down: (2, 3) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (1, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move left.
- Right: (3, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move right.
- Up-left: (1, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move up-left.
- Up-right: (3, 1) is an empty space, so I can move up-right, but it's not the most direct path to the goal.
- Down-left: (1, 3) is an empty space, so I can move down-left, but it's not the most direct path to the goal.
- Down-right: (3, 3) is a wall, so I cannot move down-right.

Considering the goal is (2, 0), the most direct path would be to move up. However, since (2, 1) is a wall, I need to find an alternative. The next best option is to move to (1, 3) or (3, 1), but since the goal is above the current position, I will choose to move to (3, 1) as it is closer to the goal in terms of vertical distance.

However, upon re-examining the options, I realize that moving to (1, 3) or (3, 1) would not be the best immediate choice in terms of direct distance to the goal, considering the constraints of the maze and the need for a step-by-step approach. Given the direct path to the goal is blocked by a wall and the goal's position relative to the current position, a better immediate strategy would be to move around the wall blocking the direct path to the goal.

Given the constraints and the goal's position directly above the current position but blocked by a wall, the most logical next step to get closer to the goal or to create a path towards it, considering the maze's layout, is actually to move to (3, 1) as initially considered, but recognizing this might not directly lead to the goal due to the oversight in initial analysis. The correct approach should involve re-evaluating the maze to find the shortest path, which typically would involve using a pathfinding algorithm like BFS or A* for an optimal solution.

However, given the immediate options and the direct goal of moving towards (2, 0), and acknowledging the error in the direct approach logic due to the wall at (2, 1), a more appropriate immediate action, considering typical maze-solving strategies and the direct approach being blocked, would be to reconsider the maze layout and look for a path that moves around the blocking wall, potentially involving moving to an adjacent empty space that could lead to a path around the wall.

Given the need for a precise next move and acknowledging the oversight in the direct path analysis, let's correct the approach by identifying a viable next step that aligns with moving towards the goal or setting up for it, considering the maze's constraints and typical pathfinding strategies.

Correcting the analysis: Given the goal is directly above but blocked by a wall, and considering the available empty spaces, a logical next step to create a path towards the goal or to navigate around the blocking wall would involve moving to a position that could potentially lead around the wall or create a direct path to the goal.

Given the constraints and the goal, a logical approach is to move diagonally to (3, 1), which was initially considered but not correctly justified as the best next step given the direct goal and the maze's layout.

The corrected justification for the next move, taking into account the need to navigate around the wall blocking the direct path to the goal, involves recognizing the potential paths that could lead around the wall or create a more direct route to the goal.

Upon further reflection, considering the immediate goal and the maze's layout, the best next move, taking into account the direct path being blocked and the need to navigate around the wall, is actually to move to (1, 3) as it represents a viable step in creating a path around the blocking wall, acknowledging the error in initial direct path logic.

The next move is to (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player position at (1, 3), I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces to determine the next move.

- Up: (1, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move up.
- Down: (1, 4) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (0, 3) is an empty space, so I can move left.
- Right: (2, 3) is a wall, so I cannot move right.
- Up-left: (0, 2) is an empty space, so I can move up-left.
- Up-right: (2, 2) is an empty space, so I can move up-right.
- Down-left: (0, 4) is an empty space, but it's not the most direct path to the goal.
- Down-right: (2, 4) is a wall, so I cannot move down-right.

Considering the goal is (2, 0), I need to move up and then right to reach the goal. Since (1, 2) is a wall, I will move up-left to (0, 2) to create a path around the wall.

The next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player position at (0, 2), I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces to determine the next move.

- Up: (0, 1) is an empty space, so I can move up.
- Down: (0, 3) is an empty space, so I can move down, but it's not the most direct path to the goal.
- Left: (0, 1) is an empty space, but I'm considering moving up, so this is the same option.
- Right: (1, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move right.
- Up-left: (0, 1) is an empty space, but I'm considering moving up, so this is the same option.
- Up-right: (1, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move up-right.
- Down-left: (0, 1) is not a valid down-left move, as it's above the current position.
- Down-right: (1, 3) is an empty space, but it's not the most direct path to the goal.

Considering the goal is (2, 0), I need to move right and then down to reach the goal. However, since (1, 2) is a wall, I will move up to (0, 1) to create a path around the wall and get closer to the goal.

The next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player position at (0, 1), I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces to determine the next move.

- Up: (0, 0) is an empty space, so I can move up.
- Down: (0, 2) is an empty space, so I can move down, but it's not the most direct path to the goal.
- Left: There is no space to the left, as I'm at the leftmost edge of the maze.
- Right: (1, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move right.
- Up-left: There is no space to the up-left, as I'm at the leftmost edge of the maze.
- Up-right: (1, 0) is an empty space, so I can move up-right.
- Down-left: There is no space to the down-left, as I'm at the leftmost edge of the maze.
- Down-right: (1, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move down-right.

Considering the goal is (2, 0), I need to move right to reach the goal. Since (1, 1) is a wall, I will move up-right to (1, 0) to create a path around the wall and get closer to the goal.

The next move is to (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player position at (1, 0), I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces to determine the next move.

- Up: There is no space above, as I'm at the top edge of the maze.
- Down: (1, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (0, 0) is an empty space, but moving left would take me away from the goal.
- Right: (2, 0) is the goal, so I can move right.

Considering the goal is (2, 0) and it's directly to the right of my current position, I will move right to (2, 0) to reach the goal.

The next move is to (2, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a U-shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces in this maze form a U-shape, similar to the original maze.
