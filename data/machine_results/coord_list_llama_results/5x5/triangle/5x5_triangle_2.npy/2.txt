You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current position and the available empty spaces.

The current player position is (2, 2). The goal is to reach (2, 0). 

Available empty spaces adjacent to the current position are:
- (1, 3) (diagonal, but not directly moving towards the goal)
- (3, 1) (diagonal, but not directly moving towards the goal)
- (2, 1) is not available as it is a wall
- (2, 3) is not available as it is a wall
- (1, 2) is not available as it is a wall
- (3, 2) is not available as it is a wall

However, since the goal is (2, 0) and moving diagonally does not directly approach the goal, and moving up or down is blocked by walls, the best next move is to move left to (2, 1) is blocked, so we should try to move around the wall. The closest empty space to move towards the goal would be (1, 3) or (3, 1), but neither directly moves us closer to the goal in the x-axis direction which is our priority. However, given the constraints, moving to (1, 3) seems like a viable option to start navigating around the walls, but since we are trying to reach (2, 0), we should prioritize moving in the direction that reduces the y-coordinate when possible.

Given the direct path to the goal is blocked, a better initial strategy would be to move towards a position that allows for more flexible movement towards the goal. However, considering the immediate options and the goal, a more strategic move would be to move to an empty space that could potentially lead us closer to the goal in the subsequent moves. Since (1, 3) and (3, 1) are both diagonal and not directly leading to the goal but are the only immediate options for movement, we must choose one of these.

Upon reconsideration for a direct path or the most logical next step given the constraints and aiming to reduce the y-coordinate or move closer to the goal, moving to (3, 1) could be seen as a strategic move because it keeps us at a similar x-coordinate and allows for potential movement closer to the goal in subsequent steps, but it does not directly reduce the y-coordinate distance to the goal. However, given the direct options and the need to navigate around walls, this seems like a potential misstep without further analysis of subsequent moves.

The most immediate and direct move towards reducing the distance in the y-axis direction isn't available due to walls, so we must navigate around them. Given the constraints and the immediate goal of moving closer to (2, 0), we should aim to reduce our y-coordinate when possible or position ourselves for such a move. 

However, the immediate best move given the constraints and aiming for a strategic position for the next move, considering the direct path to the goal is blocked and we need to navigate around the walls, would actually be to move to (3, 1) if we're considering diagonal moves that might position us better for the next move, but this doesn't directly address moving closer to the goal in the most efficient manner given the need to reduce the y-coordinate.

Given the need to provide a move and the analysis above, a strategic move considering the walls and the need to eventually reduce the y-coordinate to reach the goal, moving to an empty space that allows for future movement towards the goal is crucial. However, my analysis prioritized direct movement and navigation around walls without providing a clear "best" move given the constraints and the goal.

Given the constraints and the analysis, the move to (3, 1) might not be the best immediate choice if we consider the potential for moving closer to the goal in subsequent steps without direct access to reduce the y-coordinate. The correct approach would involve a more detailed analysis of subsequent moves to ensure we're moving towards the goal efficiently, considering the maze's layout.

However, without a clear path and based on the immediate need to move, if we must choose a move without further analysis, moving to (1, 3) or (3, 1) would be the options, with a preference for a move that could potentially align us better for a direct path to the goal in subsequent moves.

Given this analysis, a move to (3, 1) could be considered if we prioritize moving to a space that allows for potential realignment towards the goal, but this move does not directly address the need to reduce the y-coordinate to reach the goal. The focus should be on navigating towards a position that allows for a reduction in the y-coordinate in the next moves.

Considering the need for a strategic move that positions us for future moves towards the goal and given the constraints, my analysis aimed to

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the current player position (3, 1), the goal is still to reach (2, 0).

Available empty spaces adjacent to the current position are:
- (2, 2) (diagonal, but moving away from the goal in terms of y-coordinate)
- (3, 0) (directly below, moving closer to the goal in terms of y-coordinate)

Since the goal is to reduce the y-coordinate to reach the goal, the best next move would be to move to (3, 0). This move directly reduces the distance to the goal in the y-axis direction.

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the current player position (3, 0), the goal is to reach (2, 0).

Since the goal is directly to the left of the current position, and there are no walls blocking the path, the best next move would be to move to (2, 0) directly.

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a "horseshoe shape", with the empty spaces forming a curved path around the walls.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar U-shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original. The empty spaces form a U-shape, similar to the original maze.
