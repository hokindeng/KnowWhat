You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current position and the available empty spaces.

The current player position is (2, 2). The goal is to reach (2, 0). 

Available empty spaces adjacent to the current position are:
- (1, 3) (diagonal, but not directly moving towards the goal)
- (3, 1) (diagonal, but not directly moving towards the goal)
- (2, 1) is not available as it is a wall
- (2, 3) is not available as it is a wall
- (1, 2) is not available as it is a wall
- (3, 2) is not available as it is a wall

However, I can move diagonally to (3, 1) and then try to find a path from there, but since my goal is (2, 0), a more direct approach would be to move to (3, 0) if possible or move to (1, 0) if possible, but since I can only move to adjacent empty spaces, I will try to get closer to the goal by moving to an empty space that can lead me to the goal.

Considering the available options, I will move diagonally to (3, 1) as it seems to be the most direct path towards the goal for now.

Next move: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 1), I'll analyze the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position.

Available empty spaces adjacent to the current position are:
- (2, 2) (diagonal, but not directly moving towards the goal)
- (3, 0) (directly moving towards the goal and closer to it)

Since my goal is (2, 0), moving to (3, 0) seems to be the most direct path towards the goal for now.

Next move: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 0), I'll analyze the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position.

Available empty spaces adjacent to the current position are:
- (2, 2) is not adjacent, it's 2 spaces away, but (2, 1) is a wall, so I would need to move to (2, 2) and then find another path, which is not the most direct path
- (4, 0) (not moving towards the goal)
- (2, 0) is the goal, but it's not directly adjacent as (2, 1) is a wall
- (1, 0) and other spaces are not adjacent

However, I can try to move to (2, 0) directly, but since (2, 1) is a wall, I would need to move around it. Since I'm already at y-coordinate 0, I can try to move directly to the goal by going around the wall.

Wait, I can move to (2, 0) if I go around the wall, but since I'm at (3, 0), I can move to (2, 0) if I go through the empty space that is not blocked by a wall. In this case, I can move to (1, 0) and then to (2, 0), but that would be 2 moves. However, I can also move directly to (2, 0) from (3, 0) if I consider the diagonal movement to the goal is blocked by the wall at (2, 1), but the horizontal movement is not.

Available empty spaces adjacent to the current position that can lead to the goal are not available, but since the goal is at the same y-coordinate, I can move directly to it.

Next move: (2, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape", as it has two vertical paths connected by a horizontal path at one end.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a U-shape.
