You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 1), and the goal is to reach position (0, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
From the current position (2, 1), we need to look at all eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) and identify which of these directions lead to empty spaces.

## Step 4: Choose the best move
Given the goal is at (0, 2), we should prioritize moves that reduce the distance to the goal. Moving up and left would be ideal as it directly reduces the distance to the goal.

## Step 5: Select the next move
Considering the maze layout and the goal position, moving diagonally up-left would be the most efficient move, as it reduces the distance in both the x and y axes towards the goal. However, we need to ensure the target position is an empty space.

## Step 6: Verify the target position is empty
The position diagonally up-left from (2, 1) would be (1, 2), but this is a wall. Therefore, we need to consider the next best option, which would be moving left to (2, 0) or moving up to (1, 1). Since (2, 0) is a wall, the best option is to move up to (1, 1), which is an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Re-evaluate the maze after the last move
The player is now at position (1, 1), and the goal remains at (0, 2). We need to consider the updated maze layout to plan the next move.

## Step 2: Analyze possible moves from the current position
From (1, 1), we examine all eight directions to find empty spaces. Moving up would put us at (0, 1), which is an empty space and closer to the goal.

## Step 3: Choose the best move
Given the goal's proximity, moving up to (0, 1) seems the most logical choice as it directly reduces the distance to the goal and places us in an empty space.

## Step 4: Consider alternative moves
Other moves, such as moving diagonally, do not offer a direct path to the goal or may place us in a position that does not efficiently reduce the distance to the goal.

## Step 5: Verify the chosen move's feasibility
Since (0, 1) is confirmed to be an empty space, this move is feasible.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal proximity
The player is now at (0, 1), and the goal is at (0, 2), which means the goal is directly to the right of the player's current position.

## Step 2: Evaluate possible moves
Given the goal's location, the most direct move would be to move right to (0, 2). However, we need to verify if (0, 2) is an empty space or a wall.

## Step 3: Check the status of the target position
Upon reviewing the maze layout, it's noticed that (0, 2) is not listed as an empty space or a wall based on the provided information. However, since the goal is placed at (0, 2), it implies that (0, 2) should be considered as a valid destination, even though it's not explicitly listed as an empty space.

## Step 4: Decide on the move
Given the direct access to the goal and assuming (0, 2) is accessible since it's the goal, moving right to (0, 2) is the most logical choice.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
Upon reviewing the original maze, the empty spaces seem to form a diagonal or somewhat zigzag path from the player's starting position to the goal, but considering the overall structure, it can be argued that the path resembles a diagonal line with certain deviations due to the maze's layout. However, given the constraints and the need for a clear shape, let's simplify the interpretation to a more recognizable pattern that can be emulated in a new maze.

## Step 2: Choose a recognizable shape for the new maze's empty spaces
Given the complexity of the original maze's path, let's aim for a simpler, more recognizable shape that can be easily replicated in a new maze, such as a diagonal line or a zigzag pattern. For simplicity and clarity, let's opt for a zigzag pattern as the general shape for the new maze's empty spaces.

## Step 3: Design a new maze with the chosen shape
To create a new maze with the same size (5x5) and a zigzag pattern for the empty spaces, we'll place the empty spaces in a zigzag pattern from the top-left to the bottom-right, ensuring there's a valid path from the player's position (P) to the goal (G).

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Here's a new maze encoded in the same format as the original, with walls (W), empty spaces (E), player position (P), and goal (G), forming a zigzag pattern:

- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
- Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3)
- Player position: (0, 1)
- Goal: (4, 3)

The final answer is: 
For (1), let's simplify to a "zigzag" as the general shape for ease of replication in a new maze.
For (2), the new maze is provided above, encoded with walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal, forming a zigzag pattern.
