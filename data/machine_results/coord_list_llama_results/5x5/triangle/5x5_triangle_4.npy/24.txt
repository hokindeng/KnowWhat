You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I'm only asked for the next move, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best next step.

The current player position is (2, 1). The goal is (0, 2). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: Not possible, as (1, 1) is the only option, but it's not directly above.
- Down: Not possible, as there's a wall below.
- Left: Not possible, as there's a wall to the left.
- Right: (2, 2) is an empty space and a possible move.
- Diagonals: Not possible, as there are walls or no empty spaces in the diagonals.

Considering the options, my next move would be to (2, 2), as it's the only available empty space adjacent to the current position.

Next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: (1, 1) and (1, 3) are possible, but (1, 2) is a wall, so I'll consider the diagonals.
- Down: Not possible, as there's a wall below.
- Left: (2, 1) is an empty space and a possible move.
- Right: Not possible, as there's a wall to the right.
- Diagonals: (1, 1) and (1, 3) are possible moves.

Considering the options, my next move would be to (1, 1), as it's one step closer to the goal and opens up more possibilities for the next move.

Next move: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1, 1), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: Not possible, as there's a wall above.
- Down: (2, 1) is an empty space, but it's not closer to the goal.
- Left: (0, 1) is an empty space and a possible move, which is closer to the goal.
- Right: Not possible, as there's a wall to the right.
- Diagonals: Not possible, as there are walls or no empty spaces in the diagonals.

Considering the options, my next move would be to (0, 1), as it's one step closer to the goal and opens up more possibilities for the next move.

Next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0, 1), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: Not possible, as there's a wall above.
- Down: (1, 1) is an empty space, but it's not closer to the goal.
- Left: Not possible, as there's a wall to the left.
- Right: The goal (0, 2) is not an empty space in the list, but it's the goal, and I can try to move there. However, I notice that (0, 2) is not in the empty spaces list, which might indicate that it's not directly accessible. I'll consider the next best option.
- Diagonals: Not possible, as there are walls or no empty spaces in the diagonals.

Since the goal is not directly accessible, I will move to an adjacent empty space that might help me get closer to the goal. However, I notice that there are no adjacent empty spaces that are closer to the goal. In this case, I will move to an empty space that might give me more options for the next move.

Considering the options, my next move would be to (0, 3), as it's an empty space that might give me more options for the next move.

Next move: (0, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag or staircase shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a zigzag or staircase shape.
