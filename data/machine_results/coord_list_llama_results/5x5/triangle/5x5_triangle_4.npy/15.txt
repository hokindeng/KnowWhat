You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 1), and the goal is to reach position (0, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
From the player's current position (2, 1), we need to look at the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) and identify which of these directions lead to an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the best move
Given the goal is at (0, 2), the most direct path would involve moving in a direction that reduces the distance to the goal. Since moving diagonally can cover more ground, we should prioritize diagonal moves if possible.

## Step 5: Determine the next move
Looking at the empty spaces, moving diagonally up-left would bring the player closer to the goal. The new position after such a move would be (1, 2), but since (1, 2) is a wall, we need to consider other options. The next best option is to move up to (2, 2) if it's an empty space, or left to (1, 1) if it's empty, as these moves still bring the player closer to the goal or prepare for a diagonal move.

## Step 6: Verify the chosen move is valid
Since (2, 2) is listed as an empty space, moving up to (2, 2) is a valid move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout and current position
The player is now at position (2, 2), and the goal remains at (0, 2). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Analyze possible moves from the new position
From (2, 2), we examine the eight possible directions for a move. Since the goal is directly to the left and up is not an option due to the wall at (2, 3) and other positions, we prioritize moves that bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 3: Choose the best move
Given the layout, moving diagonally up-left would be ideal, but since (1, 2) is a wall, we must consider other options. Moving left to (1, 2) is not possible because it's a wall. The next best option is to move down-left to (1, 1) if it's empty, as it prepares for a potential move closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Verify the chosen move is valid
Since (1, 1) is listed as an empty space, moving down-left to (1, 1) is a valid move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal
The player is now at position (1, 1), and the goal is at (0, 2). We need to find a move that brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 2: Analyze possible moves from the current position
From (1, 1), we look at the eight possible directions. Since moving directly up to the goal is blocked by the wall at (1, 2), we consider alternative moves.

## Step 3: Choose the best move
Given the layout, moving up-left to (0, 1) would be a good option as it brings us closer to the goal and is not blocked by a wall.

## Step 4: Verify the chosen move is valid
Since (0, 1) is listed as an empty space, moving up-left to (0, 1) is a valid move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal
The player is now at position (0, 1), and the goal is directly above at (0, 2).

## Step 2: Analyze possible moves from the current position
From (0, 1), we examine the possible directions. Since the goal is directly up and there are no walls blocking the path up, we prioritize this direction.

## Step 3: Choose the best move
Given the layout, moving up to (0, 2) is the most direct path to the goal.

## Step 4: Verify the chosen move is valid
Since there are no walls listed at (0, 2) and it's the goal position, moving up to (0, 2) is a valid move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
After analyzing the original maze, it appears that the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a diagonal line or a staircase from the bottom right to the top left, but with some deviations. However, if we simplify the shape by focusing on the main path from the player's starting position to the goal, it can be argued that the general shape is a form of a zigzag or a modified diagonal line.

## Step 2: Determine the correct classification of the shape
Given the complexity and the specific layout of the empty spaces, it might be more accurate to describe the shape as a "zigzag" or a "diagonal with deviations." However, since these descriptions might not fully capture the essence of the maze's design, and considering the need for a clear and recognizable shape for the new maze, we will aim to create a new maze with empty spaces that form a more distinct diagonal line.

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same size and a distinct diagonal shape
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we will design it so that the empty spaces form a clear diagonal line from one corner of the maze to the opposite corner. This diagonal line will serve as the primary path from the player's starting position to the goal.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Here is the new maze encoded in the same format as the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 2)

However, to correct the format and ensure the maze fits the description given in the task, let's adjust it to better match the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 2)

This adjustment ensures the maze has a clear diagonal path and meets the size and shape requirements.

The final answer is:

(1) Diagonal

(2) Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 2)
