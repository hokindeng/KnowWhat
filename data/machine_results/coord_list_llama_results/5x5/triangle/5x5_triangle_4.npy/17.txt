You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

The player is at position (2, 1), and the goal is at position (0, 2). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the player position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- (1, 1) (left and up)
- (2, 2) (right)
- (3, 1) (down)

Since the goal is at (0, 2), I will move towards the left and up to get closer to the goal. Therefore, my next move will be to position (1, 1).

Next move: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

The player is at position (1, 1), and the goal is at position (0, 2). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the player position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- (0, 1) (left)
- (1, 3) (down and right, but not directly towards the goal)
- (2, 1) (right, but moving away from the goal)
- (2, 2) (right and up, but not directly towards the goal)

Since the goal is at (0, 2), I will move towards the left to get closer to the goal. Therefore, my next move will be to position (0, 1).

Next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

The player is at position (0, 1), and the goal is at position (0, 2). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the player position.

However, I notice that the goal position (0, 2) is not in the list of empty spaces. This means that the goal position is actually blocked by a wall. But I also notice that the wall is not directly adjacent to my current position.

In this case, I will move to the position that is closest to the goal and try to find an alternative path. The closest empty space to the goal is not directly accessible, but I can try to move up and right, or move right and then up. However, since the position (1, 2) has a wall, I will try to move up and right, but the only option to move up is not available. Therefore, I will move right and then try to move up.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- (0, 3) (down and right, not directly towards the goal, but an option)
- (0, 4) (down and right, not directly towards the goal)
- (1, 1) (right)

Since the goal is at (0, 2), I will move right and try to find an alternative path. Therefore, my next move will be to position (1, 1).

However, I was already at this position, and I know that moving to (0, 1) was the correct move. I should try to move up, but it's blocked by a wall. In that case, I should try to move around the wall.

Let me re-evaluate the situation.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- (0, 3) (down and right, not directly towards the goal, but an option)
- (0, 4) (down and right, not directly towards the goal)

I will move down and right, and try to find an alternative path. Therefore, my next move will be to position (0, 3).

Next move: (0, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "winding path".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and it includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G) that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is a zigzag or winding path, similar to the original maze.
