You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 1), and the goal is to reach position (0, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
From the current position (2, 1), we need to look at all eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) and identify which of these directions lead to empty spaces.

## Step 4: Choose the best move
Given the goal is at (0, 2), we should prioritize moves that reduce the distance to the goal. Moving up and to the left would be ideal, but we need to ensure the chosen move does not hit a wall or go out of bounds.

## Step 5: Select the move
Looking at the empty spaces, moving diagonally up and to the left would be the most efficient, aiming for (1, 2) is not possible since it's a wall, so we aim for the closest empty space in that general direction, which is (1, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Re-evaluate the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (1, 1). The goal remains at (0, 2).

## Step 2: Analyze possible moves from the new position
From (1, 1), we examine all eight directions to find moves into empty spaces.

## Step 3: Consider the goal's direction
The goal is up and to the left of the current position, suggesting that moving in this direction would be optimal.

## Step 4: Choose the best move
Given the goal's location and the available empty spaces, moving directly up to (0, 1) is the closest we can get to the goal without hitting a wall.

## Step 5: Select the move
Thus, the best move is to (0, 1), as it brings the player closer to the goal and is a valid move into an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position in relation to the goal
The player is now at (0, 1), and the goal is at (0, 2), which is directly to the right of the player's current position.

## Step 2: Check for obstacles between the player and the goal
There are no walls between (0, 1) and (0, 2), but (0, 2) is not listed as an empty space, indicating it might have been overlooked or is considered a special case as it's the goal.

## Step 3: Determine the best move
Given the goal is adjacent to the player's current position and there are no walls in the way, the most direct and efficient move is to move right to (0, 2), even though it's not explicitly listed as an empty space. It's the only logical move to reach the goal.

## Step 4: Confirm the move
Thus, the best and only move to achieve the goal is to move to (0, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that can be described as a diagonal or zigzag path from the player's position to the goal, navigating through the available empty spaces. However, if we look closely, the overall shape that allows movement from the start to the goal, considering the arrangement of empty spaces, resembles a diagonal line with certain deviations due to the placement of walls and empty spaces. Thus, the general shape can be considered a "Diagonal" with adjustments for navigation.

## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same general shape
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it's the same size (5x5), has a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and forms a similar "Diagonal" shape with its empty spaces.

## Step 3: Define the new maze's walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal
Given the constraints and the aim to replicate the "Diagonal" shape, we can define the new maze as follows:

- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
- Player position: (4, 1)
- Goal: (0, 1)

This setup maintains the diagonal progression towards the goal while navigating through the empty spaces, similar to the original maze but with a distinct layout.

The final answer is: 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)
