You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

The player is at position (2, 1), and the goal is at position (0, 2). I will explore the adjacent empty spaces to the player position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- (1, 1) (left)
- (2, 2) (right)
- (3, 1) (down)
- (1, 2) is not empty (wall)
- (2, 0) is not empty (wall)
- (3, 0) is not empty (wall)
- (1, 0) is not empty (wall)
- (3, 2) is not empty (wall)

My next move will be to the position that is closest to the goal. Since the goal is at (0, 2), I will move to the left, which is position (1, 1).

Next move: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

The player is at position (1, 1), and the goal is at position (0, 2). I will explore the adjacent empty spaces to the player position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- (0, 1) (left)
- (1, 3) (down-right, but not directly towards the goal)
- (2, 1) (right, but not directly towards the goal)
- (2, 2) (down-right, but not directly towards the goal)
- (0, 0) is not empty (wall)
- (1, 0) is not empty (wall)
- (1, 2) is not empty (wall)

My next move will be to the position that is closest to the goal. Since the goal is at (0, 2), I will move to the left, which is position (0, 1).

Next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

The player is at position (0, 1), and the goal is at position (0, 2). However, there is a wall at (1, 2) and the goal is directly above a wall at (0, 0) and to the right of the current position, but there is no wall directly between the current position and the goal position's y-coordinate at x-coordinate 0. Unfortunately, the position directly above the current position, (0, 2), is the goal but is blocked by being out of the empty space list, and the only empty space that has the same x-coordinate is the current position. The position to the right of the current position is a wall. I will explore the adjacent empty spaces to the player position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- (0, 3) (down)
- (1, 1) (right)
- (0, 4) (down)

My next move will be to the position that is closest to the goal in the y-direction. Since the goal is at (0, 2), I will move down to position (0, 3) and then I can try to find a way back up.

Next move: (0, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a zigzag shape that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal position. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape and structure.
