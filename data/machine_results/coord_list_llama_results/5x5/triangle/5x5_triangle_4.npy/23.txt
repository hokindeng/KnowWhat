You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I'm only asked for the next move, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best next step.

The current player position is (2, 1). The goal is (0, 2). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: Not possible, as (1, 1) is the only option, but I'll consider other directions first.
- Down: Not possible, as there's a wall at (3, 1) and other positions below.
- Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (2, 0).
- Right: Not possible, as there's a wall at (2, 3) and other positions to the right.
- Up-Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (1, 0).
- Up-Right: Possible, as (1, 2) is not an option due to being a wall, but (1, 1) and then potentially up or right could be.
- Down-Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (3, 0).
- Down-Right: Not possible, as there's a wall at (3, 2).

Given the options, the best next move would be to move up to (1, 1), as it opens up possibilities to move closer to the goal and it's the only viable option at this point.

Next move: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze and the current player position at (1, 1), I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces to determine the best next move.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: Possible, as (0, 1) is an empty space.
- Down: Not possible, as there's a wall at (2, 0) and other positions below, but (2, 1) is an option.
- Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (1, 0).
- Right: Not possible, as there's a wall at (1, 2).
- Up-Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (0, 0).
- Up-Right: Not possible, as there's a wall at (1, 2), but moving up and then right could be an option.
- Down-Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (2, 0).
- Down-Right: Not possible, as there's a wall at (2, 2) is not a wall, but moving down is not the best option.

Given the options, the best next move would be to move up to (0, 1), as it brings me closer to the goal and opens up possibilities to move right towards the goal.

Next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze and the current player position at (0, 1), I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces to determine the best next move.

The goal is (0, 2), which is directly to the right of the current position. However, (0, 2) is not listed as an empty space, and (1, 2) is a wall, which means (0, 2) is not accessible from the current position by moving right.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: Not possible, as there's a wall at (0, 0) and no space above.
- Down: Possible, as (1, 1) is an empty space, but moving down would take me away from the goal.
- Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (0, 0).
- Right: Not possible, as the goal (0, 2) is not an empty space, but I'll consider other options.
- Up-Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (0, 0) and no space above.
- Up-Right: Not possible, as there's no space above.
- Down-Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (1, 0).
- Down-Right: Possible, as (1, 1) and then potentially right and up could be an option.

However, considering the goal is (0, 2) and it's not accessible from the current position, I will move down to (1, 1) and then reassess the situation.

Next move: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze and the current player position at (1, 1), I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces to determine the best next move.

Since the goal is (0, 2) and it's not accessible from the current position by moving up and right, I will try to move around the wall at (1, 2).

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: Possible, as (0, 1) is an empty space, but I've already been there.
- Down: Not possible, as there's a wall at (2, 0) and other positions below, but (2, 1) is an option.
- Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (1, 0).
- Right: Not possible, as there's a wall at (1, 2).
- Up-Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (0, 0).
- Up-Right: Not possible, as there's a wall at (1, 2).
- Down-Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (2, 0).
- Down-Right: Possible, as (2, 2) is an empty space.

I will move down-right to (2, 2), as it allows me to move around the wall at (1, 2) and potentially get closer to the goal.

Next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze and the current player position at (2, 2), I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces to determine the best next move.

Since the goal is (0, 2) and I'm currently at (2, 2), I will try to move up towards the goal.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: Not possible, as there's a wall at (1, 2).
- Down: Not possible, as there's a wall at (3, 2).
- Left: Possible, as (2, 1) is an empty space.
- Right: Not possible, as there's a wall at (2, 3).
- Up-Left: Possible, as (1, 1) is an empty space.
- Up-Right: Not possible, as there's a wall at (1, 2) and other positions above.
- Down-Left: Possible, as (3, 1) is an empty space, but moving down would take me away from the goal.
- Down-Right: Not possible, as there's a wall at (3, 2) and other positions below.

I will move up-left to (1, 1), as it allows me to move closer to the goal and potentially find a way around the wall at (1, 2).

Next move: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze and the current player position at (1, 1), I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces to determine the best next move.

Since the goal is (0, 2) and I'm currently at (1, 1), I will try to move up towards the goal.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: Possible, as (0, 1) is an empty space.
- Down: Not possible, as I've already been to (2, 1) and other positions below.
- Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (1, 0).
- Right: Not possible, as there's a wall at (1, 2).
- Up-Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (0, 0).
- Up-Right: Not possible, as there's a wall at (1, 2), but moving up and then right could be an option.
- Down-Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (2, 0).
- Down-Right: Possible, as (2, 2) is an empty space, but moving down would take me away from the goal.

I will move up to (0, 1), as it allows me to move closer to the goal and potentially find a way to reach (0, 2).

Next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze and the current player position at (0, 1), I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces to determine the best next move.

Since the goal is (0, 2) and I'm currently at (0, 1), I will try to move right towards the goal.

However, I notice that (0, 2) is not listed as an empty space, which means it's not directly accessible from my current position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: Not possible, as there's a wall at (0, 0) and no space above.
- Down: Possible, as (1, 1) is an empty space, but moving down would take me away from the goal.
- Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (0, 0).
- Right: Not possible, as the goal (0, 2) is not an empty space.
- Up-Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (0, 0) and no space above.
- Up-Right: Not possible, as there's no space above.
- Down-Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (1, 0).
- Down-Right: Possible, as (1, 1) and then potentially right and up could be an option, but I've already tried that path.

I will move right-down to (1, 1) is not the best option, instead I will move right-up is not possible, so I will try to move right by going down and then right and then up, but that is also not possible, so I will try to move right-up by going up is not possible, so I will try to move right by going right and down is not possible so I will go right and up is not possible so I will go down and right and up is the only possible solution to this problem so I will go (1,1).

However I see that going down (1,1) and then right (1,3) or (2,2)  or (2,1) and then up is not possible because there is a wall so the only possible solution is going down (1,1) and then (1,3) and then up and right or going down (1,1) and then (2,1) and then (2,2) and then up and right.

Next move: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze and the current player position at (1, 1), I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces to determine the best next move.

Since the goal is (0, 2) and I'm currently at (1, 1), I will try to move up and right towards the goal.

However, I notice that (1, 2) is a wall, which means I need to find an alternative path.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: Possible, as (0, 1) is an empty space, but I've already been there.
- Down: Not possible, as there's a wall at (2, 0) and other positions below, but (2, 1) is an option.
- Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (1, 0).
- Right: Not possible, as there's a wall at (1, 2), but (1, 3) is an option.
- Up-Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (0, 0).
- Up-Right: Not possible, as there's a wall at (1, 2).
- Down-Left: Not possible, as there's a wall at (2, 0).
- Down-Right: Possible, as (2, 2) is an empty space, but moving down would take me away from the goal.

I will move right to (1, 3), as it allows me to move around the wall at (1, 2) and potentially find a way to reach the goal.

Next move: (1, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "winding path".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and forms a zigzag shape with its empty spaces. It is not an identical copy of the original maze.
