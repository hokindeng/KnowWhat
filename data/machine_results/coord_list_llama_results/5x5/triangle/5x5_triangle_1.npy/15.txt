You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 4), and the goal is to reach position (2, 0).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (2, 4), we need to find an adjacent empty space that moves us closer to the goal (2, 0). Since the goal is directly above the current position and there are no empty spaces directly above the player that are closer to the goal, we need to consider moving diagonally or horizontally to an empty space that could eventually lead us to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the empty spaces available, moving directly to the left or right does not immediately provide a clear path towards the goal. However, moving diagonally up and left or up and right could potentially bring us closer. Given the empty spaces provided, (2, 3) seems like a viable option as it moves us closer to the goal by reducing the vertical distance and does not increase the horizontal distance from the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the best next move would be to the position (2, 3), as it is an empty space adjacent to the current position and moves us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout and current position
The player is now at position (2, 3), and the goal remains at position (2, 0). The empty spaces and walls remain the same as before, except for the player's new position.

## Step 2: Analyze possible moves from the new position
From the current position (2, 3), we can consider moving up, down, left, right, or diagonally to an empty space. Since the goal is directly above the current position, moving up or diagonally up would be ideal if there are empty spaces available.

## Step 3: Determine the best next move
Considering the empty spaces, moving directly up to (2, 2) is a viable option as it reduces the vertical distance to the goal without increasing the horizontal distance. This move keeps us on the same column as the goal, making it a straightforward choice.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the best next move would be to the position (2, 2), as it is an empty space directly above the current position and moves us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout and current position
The player is now at position (2, 2), and the goal remains at position (2, 0). The empty spaces and walls remain the same as before, except for the player's new position.

## Step 2: Analyze possible moves from the new position
From the current position (2, 2), we can consider moving up, down, left, right, or diagonally to an empty space. Since the goal is directly above the current position, moving up would be ideal if there is an empty space available.

## Step 3: Determine the best next move
Considering the empty spaces, moving directly up to (2, 1) is a viable option as it reduces the vertical distance to the goal without increasing the horizontal distance. This move keeps us on the same column as the goal, making it a straightforward choice.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the best next move would be to the position (2, 1), as it is an empty space directly above the current position and moves us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout and current position
The player is now at position (2, 1), and the goal remains at position (2, 0). The empty spaces and walls remain the same as before, except for the player's new position.

## Step 2: Analyze possible moves from the new position
From the current position (2, 1), we can consider moving up, down, left, right, or diagonally to an empty space. Since the goal is directly above the current position, moving up would be ideal if there is an empty space available.

## Step 3: Determine the best next move
Considering the empty spaces, moving directly up to (2, 0) is the goal position itself. This means we can reach the goal in the next move.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the best next move would be to the position (2, 0), as it is the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  0\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a diagonal line or a staircase from the top-right to the bottom-left of the maze, but with a specific turn that leads directly to the goal. However, considering the overall structure and the task's constraints, it can be generalized as forming a "staircase" or "zigzag" pattern, but most accurately it forms an "L" shape with an additional corridor leading to the start.

## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same general shape
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it's the same size (5x5), includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and forms an "L" shape with an adjustment for the start position.

## Step 3: Define the new maze's walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal
Given the constraints and the need to form an "L" shape, we can place the empty spaces in a way that they form a clear "L" pattern while ensuring there's a path from P to G. The exact positions can vary, but they must adhere to the shape and connectivity requirements.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Here's an example of a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

However, to strictly follow the format requested for the final answer, which seems to only allow for a numerical solution and given the complexity of the problem doesn't fit the requested format perfectly, I'll provide a summary statement instead, as the solution involves multiple components (walls, empty spaces, player position, goal) that cannot be encapsulated in a single numerical value as requested.

The final answer is: This problem requires a narrative response as per the details provided above.
