You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position, I will look for empty spaces around the player position.

Available moves:
- Up: (2, 3) is empty
- Down: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Left: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Right: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Diagonals: Not possible (walls or out of bounds)

My next move will be to the empty space above the player position:

Next move: (2, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)

Available moves:
- Up: Not possible (wall at (0, 3) and (1, 2) blocks the way)
- Down: (2, 4) is empty, but it's not closer to the goal
- Left: (2, 2) is empty
- Right: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Diagonals: (1, 3) is empty and (1, 2) is a wall, (3, 2) is a wall and (3, 4) is a wall, other diagonals are out of bounds

My next move will be to the empty space to the left of the player position:

Next move: (2, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Available moves:
- Up: Not possible (wall at (0, 3) and (1, 2) blocks the way, but (2, 1) is empty and closer to the goal)
- Down: (2, 3) is empty, but it's not closer to the goal
- Left: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Right: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Diagonals: (1, 1) is empty, but (2, 1) is a better option

My next move will be to the empty space above the player position, but not directly up, rather to the position (2, 1):

Next move: (2, 1)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Available moves:
- Up: Not possible (wall at (0, 0) and (1, 0) blocks the way, but the goal is just above)
- Down: (2, 2) is empty, but it's not closer to the goal
- Left: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Right: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Diagonals: (1, 1) is empty, but (1, 0) is a wall, and (3, 0) is a wall

Since the goal is just above the player position, I will try to move up. Although there are walls at (0, 0) and (1, 0), the goal position (2, 0) itself is not blocked by a wall directly above the player position.

Next move: (2, 0)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces in this maze form a zigzag shape, similar to the original maze.
