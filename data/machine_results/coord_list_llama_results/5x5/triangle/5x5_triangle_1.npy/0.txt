You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 4), and the goal is to reach position (2, 0).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (2, 4), we need to find adjacent empty spaces. However, the maze layout shows that the player is somewhat restricted in movement due to the surrounding walls and the limited empty spaces available.

## Step 4: Determine the most direct path to the goal
Considering the goal is directly west of the player's current position and there are walls and empty spaces to navigate through, the most direct path involves moving westward while avoiding walls.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the constraints and the goal to move westward, the player's next move should be to an empty space that is closer to the goal and is a valid move according to the maze rules.

## Step 6: Select the specific coordinates for the next move
Considering the empty spaces available and the need to move towards the goal at (2, 0), the player should move to an adjacent empty space that brings them closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a diagonal line or a staircase from the top-right to the bottom-left, but given the context, it seems more accurate to describe it as a "staircase" or more generally a "zigzag" or "diagonal" path. However, considering the overall structure and the direct path it aims to provide from the start to the goal, it can be best described as forming a "staircase" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with the same shape of empty spaces
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it's the same size (5x5) and has a path from P to G that resembles a "staircase" but is not an identical copy of the original maze.

## Step 3: Define the walls and empty spaces for the new maze
Given the constraints, we can mirror the original maze's path or create a new path that maintains the staircase shape but starts from a different point or moves in a slightly different direction.

## Step 4: Determine the player and goal positions in the new maze
The player and goal positions should be placed at the beginning and end of the staircase path in a way that requires navigation through the maze.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze
Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

However, to better fit the description and provide a clearer "staircase" that is not identical to the original, let's adjust the empty spaces and positions slightly.

## Step 6: Adjust the maze to better fit the "staircase" description
Given the need for a clear "staircase" path and to ensure the maze is solvable, we adjust the positions of P and G and the layout of the empty spaces.

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 2)

The final answer is:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 2)
