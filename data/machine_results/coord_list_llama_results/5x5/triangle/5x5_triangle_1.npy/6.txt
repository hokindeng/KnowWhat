You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 4), and the goal is to reach position (2, 0).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (2, 4), we need to find adjacent empty spaces. However, the maze layout provided does not explicitly list (2, 4) as an empty space or a wall, but since it's the player's current position, we will consider it as part of the path for now. We look for empty spaces around (2, 4) that are listed, considering the constraints of the maze.

## Step 4: Determine the best move towards the goal
Since the goal is at (2, 0) and we are at (2, 4), the most direct path would involve moving upwards. However, we need to ensure that the new position is an empty space. The closest empty space in the direction towards the goal from (2, 4) would be (2, 3), as moving directly to (2, 0) is not possible due to the presence of walls and the need to follow the empty spaces.

## Step 5: Confirm the move
Based on the analysis, the best next move from (2, 4) towards the goal (2, 0), considering the maze's constraints, is to (2, 3), which is an empty space and moves us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Re-evaluate the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has been updated with the player's new position at (2, 3), and the empty space list has been adjusted accordingly.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is now at position (2, 3), and the goal remains at position (2, 0).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
From (2, 3), we look for adjacent empty spaces. Given the constraints and the updated list of empty spaces, we consider moving closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the best move towards the goal
Since the goal is directly above the current position and there are no direct obstacles listed between (2, 3) and (2, 0) in the walls list that would prevent a vertical move, we look for the closest empty space in that direction. However, we must ensure the new position is indeed an empty space or the goal.

## Step 5: Confirm the move
Given the empty spaces listed, (2, 2) is the closest empty space moving upwards from (2, 3) towards the goal (2, 0). Thus, the best next move is to (2, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Re-evaluate the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has been updated with the player's new position at (2, 2), and the empty space list has been adjusted accordingly.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is now at position (2, 2), and the goal remains at position (2, 0).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
From (2, 2), we look for adjacent empty spaces that move us closer to the goal. Given the constraints and the updated list of empty spaces, moving directly up is the most direct path.

## Step 4: Determine the best move towards the goal
Since the goal is at (2, 0) and we are at (2, 2), moving up to (2, 1) is the closest we can get to the goal while still being in an empty space. The space at (2, 1) is listed as empty, making it a valid move.

## Step 5: Confirm the move
Thus, the best next move from (2, 2) towards the goal (2, 0) is to (2, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Re-evaluate the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has been updated with the player's new position at (2, 1), and the empty space list has been adjusted accordingly.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is now at position (2, 1), and the goal remains at position (2, 0).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
From (2, 1), the goal is directly above the current position. There are no empty spaces listed between (2, 1) and (2, 0), but since the goal itself is the target, we consider moving directly to it.

## Step 4: Determine the best move towards the goal
Given the direct path to the goal and no obstacles listed that would prevent the move, the best next move is directly to the goal at (2, 0).

## Step 5: Confirm the move
Thus, the best next move from (2, 1) is to (2, 0), which is the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  0\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze form a path that can be described as having a general "L" shape, considering the primary path from the player's starting position to the goal. However, considering the entire maze and the distribution of empty spaces, it might be more accurate to describe it as forming a "staircase" or "zigzag" pattern due to the diagonal nature of the path when considering all empty spaces. But focusing on the main path from start to goal, "L" shape is a simplified description.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same general shape
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it's the same size (5x5), has a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and forms an "L" shape with its empty spaces.

## Step 3: Design the new maze
Given the constraints, we can mirror the original maze's path or create a new path that maintains the "L" shape characteristic. One way to achieve this is by having the path start from a different side but still leading to a similar goal position relative to the player's start position.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

This maze maintains the "L" shape of the path, is the same size, and offers a valid path from P to G without being an identical copy of the original.

The final answer is: 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)
