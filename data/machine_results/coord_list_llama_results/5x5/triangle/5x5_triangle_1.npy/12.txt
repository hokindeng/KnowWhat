You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 4), and the goal is to reach position (2, 0).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (2, 4), we need to find an adjacent empty space that moves us closer to the goal (2, 0). Since the goal is directly above the current position and there are no empty spaces directly above the player that are adjacent, we need to consider diagonal or horizontal moves that could lead us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the empty spaces provided and the need to move closer to the goal (2, 0), the best next move would be to an empty space that allows for the most direct path towards the goal. Given the constraints and the layout, moving diagonally up and left would be ideal, but we must ensure such a move is valid within the given empty spaces.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on available empty spaces
Among the given empty spaces, (2, 3) is directly above the current position on the same x-coordinate as the goal and is an adjacent empty space, allowing for a vertical move closer to the goal. This is not a diagonal move but is the most direct path available given the constraints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout and current position
The player has moved to position (2, 3), and the goal remains at position (2, 0). The available empty spaces have been updated.

## Step 2: Identify the most direct path to the goal
Given the current position (2, 3) and the goal (2, 0), the most direct path is to move vertically up. However, we must consider the available empty spaces to determine the best next move.

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Considering the empty spaces, we can move to (2, 2), which is directly above the current position and on the same x-coordinate as the goal. This move brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Confirm the next move
Moving to (2, 2) is the best next step as it is an adjacent empty space that moves us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout and current position
The player has moved to position (2, 2), and the goal remains at position (2, 0). The available empty spaces have been updated.

## Step 2: Identify the most direct path to the goal
Given the current position (2, 2) and the goal (2, 0), the most direct path is to move vertically up. However, we must consider the available empty spaces to determine the best next move.

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Considering the empty spaces, we can move to (2, 1), which is directly above the current position and on the same x-coordinate as the goal. This move brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Confirm the next move
Moving to (2, 1) is the best next step as it is an adjacent empty space that moves us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout and current position
The player has moved to position (2, 1), and the goal remains at position (2, 0). The available empty spaces have been updated.

## Step 2: Identify the most direct path to the goal
Given the current position (2, 1) and the goal (2, 0), the most direct path is to move vertically up. However, we must consider the available empty spaces to determine the best next move.

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Considering the empty spaces, there is no empty space directly above the current position. However, we can see that the goal (2, 0) is just one step above the current position.

## Step 4: Confirm the next move
Since the goal is directly above the current position and there are no walls or obstacles in between, we can move directly to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  0\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze form a diagonal or somewhat zigzag path from the top-right to the bottom-left of the maze, but considering the main path that leads from the start to the goal, it can be seen as forming a vertical line or a column, given the direct path from (2,4) to (2,0).

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces
Given the direct vertical path from the start to the goal, the general shape can be considered a "column".

## Step 3: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same shape
To create a new maze, we need to ensure it has the same size (5x5), includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and forms a recognizable "column" shape with its empty spaces.

## Step 4: Define the new maze
Let's define the new maze with the goal at (3,0) and the player's start position at (3,4), creating a column of empty spaces from (3,4) to (3,0). We will place walls around this column and ensure there are no identical copies of the original maze's patterns.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze
Here is the new maze encoded in the same format as the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (3, 0)

However, to strictly follow the format requested for the final answer, which seems to expect numerical values only, and given the instructions were to solve a problem and provide a numerical answer in a box, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the instructions provided for this specific task, as the task involves creating a new maze rather than solving for a numerical value. Nonetheless, adhering to the requested format as closely as possible:

The final answer is: This problem does not have a numerical solution.
