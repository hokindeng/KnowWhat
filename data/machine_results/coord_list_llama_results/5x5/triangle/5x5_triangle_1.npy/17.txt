You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (2, 4), and the adjacent empty spaces are (2, 3).

My next move will be to (2, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (2, 3), and the adjacent empty spaces are (2, 2) and (1, 3), and (2, 4).

My next move will be to (2, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (2, 2), and the adjacent empty spaces are (2, 1) and (2, 3), and (1, 1) and (1, 3).

My next move will be to (2, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (2, 1), and the adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal is not available, but I can move to (1, 1).

My next move will be to (1, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (1, 1), and the adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal is not directly available. However, I can move back to (2, 1) and then try to find a way to reach the goal.

My next move will be to (2, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (2, 1), and the goal is (2, 0). Unfortunately, the goal is blocked by a wall at (3, 0) and other walls, and there is no empty space at (2, 0) that I can move to directly from (2, 1). However, I can try to move to (1, 1) and then to (0, 2) and see if I can find a path to the goal from there, but that would be moving away from the goal. Another option is to stay at the current column and try to move up, but since the goal is blocked, I will try to move to (1, 1) and then to (0, 2).

My next move will be to (1, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (1, 1), and the adjacent empty space that brings me closer to finding a path to the goal is (0, 2) or (1, 3) or back to (2, 1). Since moving to (2, 1) didn't help me find a path to the goal, I will try moving to (0, 2) or (1, 3). Moving to (0, 2) might help me find a path to the goal, but it's also possible that it's a dead end. Moving to (1, 3) might also help me find a path to the goal.

My next move will be to (1, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and has a zigzag shape formed by its empty spaces. However, it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
