You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the small size of the maze, we can visually determine the best next step towards the goal. Since we can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) and we need to get to (2, 0) from (2, 4), the most direct path would involve moving left towards the goal.

However, we need to ensure that we only move through empty spaces. The current player position is (2, 4), but this position is not listed as an empty space, which might be an oversight in the problem statement. Assuming we can start moving from (2, 4) despite it not being explicitly listed as an empty space, we look for the nearest empty space in the direction towards the goal.

The nearest empty space to the left of (2, 4) that is listed is (2, 3). Therefore, the logical next move would be to move to (2, 3).

Next move: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the current player position at (2, 3), we continue to move towards the goal at (2, 0). The next empty space in the direction towards the goal is (2, 2).

Next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the current player position at (2, 2), we continue to move towards the goal at (2, 0). The next empty space in the direction towards the goal is (2, 1).

Next move: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the current player position at (2, 1), we are now adjacent to the goal at (2, 0). However, since we can only move to empty spaces and the goal is not listed as an empty space, but rather as the goal, we will consider it as the next destination.

Next move: (2, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape, but more generally, it can be described as a " diagonal line with steps".

However, upon closer inspection, the empty spaces form a rough "L" shape or a "bent line" with some additional empty spaces branching off from it.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "L" shape or "bent line":

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form a similar "L" shape or "bent line" as in the original maze.
