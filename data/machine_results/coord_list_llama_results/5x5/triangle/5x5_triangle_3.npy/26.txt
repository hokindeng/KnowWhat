You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

The player is at the bottom-right corner of the maze, and the goal is located at the middle-left part of the maze.

Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position, I will explore the possible moves from the current position.

Possible moves from (4, 4):

* Up: (3, 4) (empty space)
* Down: Not possible (out of bounds)
* Left: (4, 3) (empty space)
* Right: Not possible (out of bounds)
* Diagonals: Not possible (walls or out of bounds)

I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move up to (3, 4).

Next move: (3, 4)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position, I will explore the possible moves from the current position.

Possible moves from (3, 4):

* Up: Not possible (wall)
* Down: (4, 4) (empty space, but I just came from there)
* Left: (3, 3) (wall)
* Right: Not possible (out of bounds)
* Diagonals: 
  * Up-left: (2, 3) (goal, but I'm not sure if I can move diagonally to the goal directly)
  * Up-right: Not possible (out of bounds)
  * Down-left: (4, 3) (empty space)
  * Down-right: Not possible (out of bounds)

However, I notice that I can move diagonally up-left to (2, 3), which is the goal position. But I will not take that risk, as I'm not sure if diagonal moves to the goal are allowed.

Instead, I will try to move left to get closer to the goal. Since (3, 3) is a wall, I will move diagonally down-left to (4, 3) and then try to find a way up to the goal.

Next move: (4, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position, I will explore the possible moves from the current position.

Possible moves from (4, 3):

* Up: (3, 3) (wall)
* Down: Not possible (out of bounds)
* Left: (4, 2) (empty space)
* Right: (4, 4) (empty space)
* Diagonals: 
  * Up-left: (3, 2) (empty space)
  * Up-right: (3, 4) (empty space)
  * Down-left: Not possible (out of bounds)
  * Down-right: Not possible (out of bounds)

I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move diagonally up-left to (3, 2).

Next move: (3, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position, I will explore the possible moves from the current position.

Possible moves from (3, 2):

* Up: (2, 2) (wall)
* Down: (4, 2) (empty space, but I don't want to move away from the goal)
* Left: (3, 1) (wall)
* Right: (3, 3) (wall)
* Diagonals: 
  * Up-left: (2, 1) (wall)
  * Up-right: (2, 3) (goal)
  * Down-left: (4, 1) (empty space, but I don't want to move away from the goal)
  * Down-right: (4, 3) (empty space, but I don't want to move away from the goal)

I notice that I can move diagonally up-right to (2, 3), which is the goal position. I will take this move.

Next move: (2, 3)

Please let me know if I have reached the goal successfully.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, and it includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G) that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape or a bent corridor.
