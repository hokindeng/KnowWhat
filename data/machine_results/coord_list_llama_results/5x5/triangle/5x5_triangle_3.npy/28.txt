You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

The player is at the bottom-right corner of the maze, and the goal is located two rows up and one column to the left.

My next move will be to move up and left to get closer to the goal. Since I can move diagonally, I will choose the diagonal move that gets me closer to the goal.

Next move: (3, 3)

This move is valid since (3, 3) is an empty space, and it gets me closer to the goal.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will plan my next move accordingly.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form an L-shape that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal position. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it retains the same general shape and structure.
