You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

The player is at the bottom-right corner of the maze, and the goal is located at the middle-left part of the maze.

My next move will be to move to an adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal. After examining the empty spaces, I decide to move to:

(3, 4)

This move brings me closer to the goal and allows me to potentially move up or left in the next step.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will plan my next move accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Since I am now at (3, 4), I can move to an adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal. I notice that I can move to (2, 4), which is an empty space and closer to the goal.

My next move will be to:

(2, 4)

This move allows me to potentially move left or down in the next step to reach the goal.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will plan my next move accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Since I am now at (2, 4), I can see that the goal is directly to my left. However, I also notice that there is a wall at (2, 2) and other positions below it, which means I need to be careful not to move too far left.

My next move will be to:

(2 is not changing, and I will decrease the y coordinate by 1) 
(2, 3) 

Wait, that is the goal!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form an L-shape, similar to the original maze.
