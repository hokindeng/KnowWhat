You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I'm only asked for the next move, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best next step.

The current player position is (4, 4). The goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to (4, 4) and choose the one that brings me closer to the goal.

The adjacent empty spaces to (4, 4) are (3, 4) and (4, 3). 

Moving to (3, 4) would bring me closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate, but it would not change the y-coordinate. 

Moving to (4, 3) would bring me closer to the goal in terms of the y-coordinate, but it would not change the x-coordinate.

Considering the goal is (2, 3), I will prioritize moving closer to the goal's y-coordinate, as it seems more important to align with the goal's y-coordinate first.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to (4, 3) and choose the one that brings me closer to the goal.

The adjacent empty spaces to (4, 3) are (4, 2) and (3, 2) and (4, 4) and (3, 4). 

Moving to (4, 2) would move me away from the goal's y-coordinate, so I will not consider it.

Moving to (4, 4) would also move me away from the goal's y-coordinate, so I will not consider it.

Moving to (3, 2) would bring me closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate, but it would move me away from the goal's y-coordinate.

Moving to (3, 4) would bring me closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate, but it would move me away from the goal's y-coordinate.

However, since I need to move closer to the goal's x-coordinate, I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal's x-coordinate while keeping in mind that I will need to adjust the y-coordinate later.

Therefore, my next move is to (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 4), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to (3, 4) and choose the one that brings me closer to the goal.

The adjacent empty spaces to (3, 4) are (2, 4) and (3, 2) and no other adjacent empty spaces.

Moving to (3, 2) would move me away from the goal's y-coordinate, so I will not consider it.

Moving to (2, 4) would bring me closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate, but it would keep me at the same distance from the goal's y-coordinate.

However, since I need to move closer to the goal's x-coordinate, I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal's x-coordinate while keeping in mind that I will need to adjust the y-coordinate later.

Therefore, my next move is to (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 4), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to (2, 4) and choose the one that brings me closer to the goal.

The goal is directly below me, but there is no empty space directly below me that I can see in the list of empty spaces. However, I can see that the goal is at (2, 3), which means that the space directly below me is actually the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to (2, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form an L-shape, similar to the original maze.
