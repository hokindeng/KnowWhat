You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and provide the immediate next step.

Given the player position is at (4, 1) and the goal is at (0, 1), and considering the layout of the maze, the most direct path would involve moving up towards the goal. However, since there are walls blocking the direct path, I need to navigate around them.

My next move would be to move to an adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal or sets me up to navigate around the walls. Given the empty spaces available, moving up directly is blocked by walls, so I need to find a path around them.

Since the player is at (4, 1) and there are empty spaces to the right at (4, 2), (4, 3), and (4, 4), but moving right does not directly bring me closer to the goal, I should consider moving left or up if possible. However, moving left is not an option as there are no empty spaces to the left of (4, 1) that would bring me closer to the goal without hitting a wall, and moving directly up is blocked.

Therefore, considering the constraints and the need to eventually navigate around the walls to reach the goal, my next move would be to utilize the available path that could potentially allow me to bypass the walls. However, given the immediate options, I recognize the oversight in my initial analysis regarding direct movement options and correct it by acknowledging that moving directly towards the goal is not immediately feasible due to the wall layout.

Upon reevaluation, considering the direct path to the goal is blocked and the need to navigate through the available empty spaces to eventually move around the walls, I should aim to use the empty spaces as efficiently as possible. Given the player's current position and the immediate options for movement:

The most logical next step, aiming to utilize the empty spaces to potentially find a path around the walls, involves considering movements that could facilitate future progress. Given this, a viable approach is to move to an adjacent empty space that could set up for future movements around the obstacles.

However, acknowledging the immediate constraints and aiming for a correction in strategy:

Given the player's position at (4, 1) and the goal to navigate towards (0, 1) while avoiding walls and utilizing the empty spaces for movement, the immediate next step should prioritize setting up for future movements that could allow navigation around the walls.

Considering the layout and the need for correction in the approach:

The immediate next move should aim at positioning for future navigation flexibility.

Given the constraints and aiming for strategic positioning:

The next move is to (4, 0), as it is an empty space adjacent to the current position and sets up for potential future moves that could allow navigation towards the goal by going around the walls.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the player's new position at (4, 0), the goal remains at (0, 1). Since the direct path up is not blocked by walls from the current position, and there are empty spaces leading up to the top row, the most logical next step is to move up towards the goal.

The next move is to (3, 0), as it is an empty space directly above the current position and brings the player closer to the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the player's new position at (3, 0), the goal remains at (0, 1). Since the direct path up is still not blocked by walls from the current position, and there are empty spaces leading up to the top row, the most logical next step is to continue moving up towards the goal.

The next move is to (2, 0), as it is an empty space directly above the current position and brings the player closer to the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the player's new position at (2, 0), the goal remains at (0, 1). Since the direct path up is still not blocked by walls from the current position, and there are empty spaces leading up to the top row, the most logical next step is to continue moving up towards the goal.

The next move is to (1, 0), as it is an empty space directly above the current position and brings the player closer to the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the player's new position at (1, 0), the goal remains at (0, 1). Since the player is now adjacent to the top row, the most logical next step is to move up and then potentially right to reach the goal.

The next move is to (0, 0), as it is an empty space directly above the current position and brings the player closer to the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the player's new position at (0, 0), the goal is at (0, 1). However, since (0, 1) is not listed as an empty space, it implies that the goal position is actually blocked or not directly accessible.

But, considering the goal is indeed at (0, 1) and it's the adjacent position to the right of the player's current position, and there's no explicit wall mentioned between (0, 0) and (0, 1), the most logical assumption is to attempt to move right towards the goal.

The next move is to (0, 1), as it is the goal position and directly to the right of the current position.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (0, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a "horseshoe shape", as it has two vertical paths connected by a horizontal path at one end.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form a U-shape, with two vertical paths connected by a horizontal path at one end.
