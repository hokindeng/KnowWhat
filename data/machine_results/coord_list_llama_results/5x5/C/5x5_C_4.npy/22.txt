You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (4, 1), and the goal is (0, 1). Since the goal is to the left of the player, I will try to move left. However, I need to check if the adjacent space to the left is empty.

The space to the left of (4, 1) is (3, 1), which is a wall. Therefore, I will try to move up or down to find an empty space. The space above (4, 1) is (4, 0), which is empty.

My next move will be to (4, 0). 

Please update the maze and let me know the new situation.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 0), I will try to move left to get closer to the goal. The space to the left of (4, 0) is (3, 0), which is empty.

My next move will be to (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 0), I will try to move left again to get closer to the goal. The space to the left of (3, 0) is (2, 0), which is empty.

My next move will be to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 0), I will try to move left again to get closer to the goal. The space to the left of (2, 0) is (1, 0), which is empty.

My next move will be to (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1, 0), I will try to move left again to get closer to the goal. The space to the left of (1, 0) is (0, 0), which is empty.

My next move will be to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0, 0), I will try to move down to reach the goal. However, I notice that (0, 1) is the goal, but I don't see it in the empty spaces list. I assume it's not a wall, since it's the goal.

My next move will be to (0, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a U-shape that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it has the same general shape.
