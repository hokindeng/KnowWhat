You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I'm only asked for the next move, I will analyze the current situation and provide the next step.

The current player position is (4, 1), and the goal is (0, 1). Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that I can move up to (3, 1), but that would put me into a wall. I can also move down, but that would take me out of the maze. I can move left to (4, 0), which is an empty space, or I can move right to (4, 2), which is also an empty space.

Since my goal is to reach (0, 1), I will try to move closer to it. Moving left to (4, 0) doesn't seem to bring me closer to the goal, but it's a valid move. However, I notice that if I move right to (4, 2), I might be able to find a path up and then left to reach the goal.

My next move will be to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 2), I can see that I have a few options. I can move up to (3, 2), but that would put me into a wall. I can move down, but that would take me out of the maze. I can move left to (4, 1), which is an empty space, or I can move right to (4, 3), which is also an empty space.

Since my goal is to reach (0, 1), I will try to move closer to it. Moving right to (4, 3) doesn't seem to bring me closer to the goal. However, I notice that if I move left to (4, 1), I might be able to find a path up and then left to reach the goal.

But wait, I was already at (4, 1) before, and I moved right to (4, 2) to try to find a better path. Moving left would just take me back to the previous position.

Let me think... Ah, I have an idea! I can try to move up and left, but since I'm blocked by a wall, I'll try to move around it. I'll move right to (4, 3) and then see if I can move up and left from there.

My next move will be to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 3), I can see that I have a few options. I can move up to (3, 3), but that would put me into a wall. I can move down, but that would take me out of the maze. I can move left to (4, 2), which is an empty space, or I can move right to (4, 4), which is also an empty space.

Since my goal is to reach (0, 1), I will try to move closer to it. Moving right to (4, 4) doesn't seem to bring me closer to the goal. However, I notice that if I move left to (4, 2), I'll just be back to the previous position, and I won't make any progress.

Let me think... Ah, I have an idea! I can try to move around the wall by going right to (4, 4) and then see if I can move up and left from there. But wait, I can also try to move up and left by going to the empty space above the wall. I can move up is not possible, but I can try to move to the leftmost empty space in the same row, which is (4, 0), and then try to move up from there.

My next move will be to (4, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces in this maze also form a U-shape, similar to the original maze.
