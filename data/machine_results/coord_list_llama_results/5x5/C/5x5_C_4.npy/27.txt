You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and provide the immediate next step.

Given the player position is at (4, 1) and the goal is at (0, 1), and considering the layout of the maze, the most direct path would involve moving up towards the goal. However, since there are walls blocking the direct path, I need to navigate around them.

My next move would be to move to an adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal or sets me up to navigate around the walls. Given the empty spaces available, moving up directly is blocked by walls, so I need to move either left or right to an empty space that allows further movement.

Since the empty spaces are at (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), and (4, 4) adjacent to my current position, and considering the goal is to the left and up, the most logical next move would be to move left to (4, 0), as this keeps me on the same row and allows for potential upward movement in the subsequent steps, navigating around the walls.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 0), I need to move up to get closer to the goal. Since the space directly above me at (3, 0) is empty, I can move there.

My next move is to (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 0), I can continue moving up to get closer to the goal. Since the space directly above me at (2, 0) is empty, I can move there.

My next move is to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 0), I can continue moving up to get closer to the goal. Since the space directly above me at (1, 0) is empty, I can move there.

My next move is to (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1, 0), I can move up to get closer to the goal. Since the space directly above me at (0, 0) is empty, I can move there.

My next move is to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0, 0), I can see that the goal is directly to my right at (0, 1). However, I also notice that (0, 1) is not listed as an empty space, which means it's not directly accessible.

But since the goal is at (0, 1) and I'm already at the correct row (0), I should try to move right. Unfortunately, the space at (0, 1) is not empty, which means I need to find an alternative route.

However, considering the maze layout, I realize that I made a mistake in my analysis. Since the goal is at (0, 1) and it's not listed as an empty space, it's actually the goal position itself, and I should be able to move there directly.

My next move is to (0, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape", as it has two vertical paths connected by a horizontal path at the top.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form a U-shape, similar to the original maze.
