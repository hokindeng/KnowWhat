You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will analyze the given information and plan a step-by-step path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

First, let's visualize the maze:

```
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   | P |   | W |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   | W | W | W | W |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   | W | W | W | W |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   | W | W | W | W |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |   | W |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
```

The player position is (0, 2), and the goal position is (3, 0). Since we can move up, down, left, or right, I will try to find a path that avoids walls.

My next move will be to move left to the empty space at (0, 1).

Next move: (0, 1)

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0, 1), I'll analyze the maze again to plan my next move.

Since my goal is to reach (3, 0), I'll try to move down to the empty space at (1, 0), but I notice that there's a wall at (1, 1) which blocks my path. Instead, I'll move left to the empty space at (0, 0).

Next move: (0, 0)

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0, 0), I'll analyze the maze again to plan my next move.

Since my goal is to reach (3, 0), I'll try to move down to the empty space at (1, 0). This move will bring me closer to the goal.

Next move: (1, 0)

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1, 0), I'll analyze the maze again to plan my next move.

Since my goal is to reach (3, 0), I'll try to move down to the empty space at (2, 0). This move will bring me closer to the goal.

Next move: (2, 0)

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2, 0), I'll analyze the maze again to plan my next move.

Since my goal is to reach (3, 0), I'll try to move down to the goal position directly. There are no walls blocking my path, so I can make a straight move.

Next move: (3, 0)

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome. I hope I've reached the goal!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a U-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form a U-shape, similar to the original maze.
