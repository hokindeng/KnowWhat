You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 2). The goal is to reach (3, 0). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: (0, 1) is empty, but moving up will not bring me closer to the goal.
- Down: (1, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (0, 1) is empty, but moving left will not bring me closer to the goal.
- Right: (0, 3) is empty, but moving right will also not bring me closer to the goal.

However, I notice that moving up to (0, 1) will allow me to move left to (0, 0) in the next step, which might bring me closer to the goal or provide more options.

My next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0, 1), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: Not possible, as I'm already at the top row.
- Down: (1, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (0, 0) is empty, which is a good option.
- Right: (0, 2) is empty, but moving right will not bring me closer to the goal.

Moving left to (0, 0) seems like the best option, as it might allow me to move down towards the goal in the next step.

My next move is to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: Not possible, as I'm already at the top row.
- Down: (1, 0) is empty, which is a good option.
- Left: Not possible, as I'm already at the leftmost column.
- Right: (0, 1) is empty, but moving right will not bring me closer to the goal.

Moving down to (1, 0) seems like the best option, as it brings me closer to the goal.

My next move is to (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: (0, 0) is empty, but moving up will take me away from the goal.
- Down: (2, 0) is empty, which is a good option.
- Left: Not possible, as I'm already at the leftmost column.
- Right: (1, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move right.

Moving down to (2, 0) seems like the best option, as it brings me closer to the goal.

My next move is to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: (1, 0) is empty, but moving up will take me away from the goal.
- Down: (3, 0) is the goal, which is the best option.
- Left: Not possible, as I'm already at the leftmost column.
- Right: (2, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move right.

Moving down to (3, 0) seems like the best option, as it is the goal.

My next move is to (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape", with the player starting at one end of the U and the goal at the other end.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar U-shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a U-shape that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it has a similar shape and structure.
