You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current position and the available empty spaces to determine the best move.

The current player position is (0, 2). The available empty spaces adjacent to the current position are:

* (0, 1)
* (0, 3)
* (1, 0) (diagonal, not considered)
* No empty space above or below the current position

Since the goal position is (3, 0), which is below and to the right of the current position, I will prioritize moving down or right. However, there is no empty space below the current position, so I will move to the right.

My next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), I will analyze the available empty spaces:

* (0, 2)
* (0, 1)
* (0, 0)
* No empty space above or below the current position, and no empty space to the right

Since the goal position is (3, 0), which is below and to the left of the current position, I will prioritize moving down or left. However, there is no empty space below the current position, so I will move to the left.

My next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), I will analyze the available empty spaces:

* (0, 1)
* (0, 3)
* (0, 0)
* No empty space above or below the current position, and no empty space to the right

Since the goal position is (3, 0), which is below and to the left of the current position, I will prioritize moving down or left. However, there is no empty space below the current position, so I will move to the left.

My next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), I will analyze the available empty spaces:

* (0, 0)
* (0, 2)
* No empty space above or to the right of the current position

Since the goal position is (3, 0), which is below the current position, I will prioritize moving down. However, there is no empty space directly below the current position. But I can move to the left, which might help me find a path down later.

My next move is to (0, 0).

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 0), I will analyze the available empty spaces:

* (0, 1)
* (1, 0)

Since the goal position is (3, 0), which is below the current position, I will prioritize moving down. I can move down to (1, 0), which is a step closer to the goal.

My next move is to (1, 0).

Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 0), I will analyze the available empty spaces:

* (0, 0)
* (2, 0)

Since the goal position is (3, 0), which is below the current position, I will prioritize moving down. I can move down to (2, 0), which is a step closer to the goal.

My next move is to (2, 0).

Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 0), I will analyze the available empty spaces:

* (1, 0)
* No other empty spaces adjacent to the current position, except possibly below

Since the goal position is (3, 0), which is directly below the current position, I will try to move down.

My next move is to (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar U-shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and its empty spaces form a U-shape that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal position. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape and structure.
