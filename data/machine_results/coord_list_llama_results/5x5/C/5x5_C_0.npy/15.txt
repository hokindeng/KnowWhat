You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current position and the available empty spaces to determine the best move.

The current player position is (0, 2). The available empty spaces adjacent to the current position are:

* (0, 1)
* (0, 3)
* (1, 0) (diagonal, not considered)
* No empty space above or below the current position

Since the goal position is (3, 0), which is below and to the right of the current position, I will prioritize moving down or right. However, since there is no empty space below the current position, I will move to the right, which means moving to the empty space (0, 3).

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 3), I will analyze the available empty spaces to determine the best move.

The available empty spaces adjacent to the current position are:

* (0, 2)

Since I was previously at (0, 2) and moved to (0, 3), moving back to (0, 2) would not bring me closer to the goal. I need to explore other options.

There is no empty space below the current position, and moving up would take me away from the goal. However, I can move to the left, which might help me find a path to the goal.

The available empty space to the left is not directly adjacent, but I can see that (0, 2), (0, 1), and (0, 0) are empty. I will move to the left, which means moving to the empty space (0, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 2), I will analyze the available empty spaces to determine the best move.

The available empty spaces adjacent to the current position are:

* (0, 1)
* (0, 3)

Since I was previously at (0, 3) and moved back to (0, 2), moving back to (0, 3) would not bring me closer to the goal. I will consider moving to (0, 1).

However, I notice that (0, 0) is also empty, and moving to (0, 1) would bring me closer to (0, 0). From (0, 0), I might be able to find a path to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 1), I will analyze the available empty spaces to determine the best move.

The available empty spaces adjacent to the current position are:

* (0, 0)
* (0, 2)

Since the goal position is (3, 0), which is below and to the right of the current position, I will prioritize moving down. However, there is no empty space directly below the current position.

I will move to the left, which means moving to the empty space (0, 0). This might help me find a path to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 0), I will analyze the available empty spaces to determine the best move.

The available empty spaces adjacent to the current position are:

* (0, 1)
* (1, 0)

Since the goal position is (3, 0), which is below the current position, I will prioritize moving down. I notice that (1, 0) is empty, which is a step in the right direction.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 0), I will analyze the available empty spaces to determine the best move.

The available empty spaces adjacent to the current position are:

* (0, 0)
* (2, 0)

Since the goal position is (3, 0), which is below the current position, I will prioritize moving down. I notice that (2, 0) is empty, which is a step in the right direction.

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 0), I will analyze the available empty spaces to determine the best move.

The available empty spaces adjacent to the current position are:

* (1, 0)
* No empty space above or to the sides
* However, I notice that the goal position (3, 0) is directly below the current position.

Since the goal position is directly below the current position, I will move down to the goal position.

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a U-shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as a U-shape.
