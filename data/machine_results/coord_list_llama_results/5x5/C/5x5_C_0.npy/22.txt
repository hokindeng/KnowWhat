You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 2). I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 1) is an empty space.
- Down: (0, 3) is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 1) is an empty space (already considered).
- Right: (0, 3) is an empty space (already considered), and (0, 4) is a wall.

Considering the goal position (3, 0), I will move down to (0, 3) as it is closer to the goal and there are no other obvious better options.

My next move is to position (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 3), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 2) is an empty space.
- Down: Not possible, as it would be outside the maze or into a wall.
- Left: (0, 2) is an empty space (already considered).
- Right: Not possible, as (0, 4) is a wall.

However, I can also consider moving to the left and then up, which would bring me closer to the goal. But a more efficient move would be to move up and then try to find a way to the right.

Considering the goal position (3, 0), I will move up to (0, 2) as it is a better option to create possibilities for future moves.

My next move is to position (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 2), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 1) is an empty space.
- Down: (0, 3) is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 1) is an empty space (already considered).
- Right: Not possible, as (0, 4) is a wall and (1, 2) is a wall.

Considering the goal position (3, 0), I will move up and left to try to find a way around the wall. Moving up to (0, 1) seems like a good option.

My next move is to position (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 1), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be outside the maze.
- Down: (0, 2) is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 0) is an empty space.
- Right: Not possible, as (1, 1) is a wall.

Considering the goal position (3, 0), I will move left to (0, 0) as it is a better option to create possibilities for future moves. Moving down to (0, 2) would not bring me closer to the goal.

My next move is to position (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 0), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be outside the maze.
- Down: (0, 1) is an empty space.
- Left: Not possible, as it would be outside the maze.
- Right: (1, 0) is an empty space.

Considering the goal position (3, 0), I will move right to (1, 0) as it is a step in the correct direction towards the goal.

My next move is to position (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)

Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 0), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be outside the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 1) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 0) is an empty space, but moving back would not bring me closer to the goal.
- Right: (2, 0) is an empty space.

Considering the goal position (3, 0), I will move right to (2, 0) as it is a step in the correct direction towards the goal.

My next move is to position (2, 0).

Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 0), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be outside the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (2, 1) is a wall.
- Left: (1, 0) is an empty space, but moving back would not bring me closer to the goal.
- Right: (3, 0) is the goal position.

Considering the goal position (3, 0), I will move right to (3, 0) as it is the final step to reach the goal.

My next move is to position (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape", as it has a curved path that connects the start and end points.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar U-shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

This new maze has a similar U-shape formed by the empty spaces, but with a different configuration of walls and corridors. The player can navigate from the start point (0, 0) to the goal point (3, 0) through the empty spaces.
