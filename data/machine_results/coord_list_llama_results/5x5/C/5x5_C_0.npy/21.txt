You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 2). The goal is to reach (3, 0). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: (0, 1) is empty
- Down: (0, 3) is empty
- Left: (0, 1) is empty
- Right: (0, 3) is empty

Since the goal is to the right and down from the current position, I will choose to move down to (0, 3), as it is closer to the goal and there are no walls blocking the path.

My next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: (0, 2) is empty
- Down: blocked by wall (0, 4)
- Left: (0, 2) is empty
- Right: blocked by wall (1, 3)

Since I need to move towards the goal (3, 0), I will choose to move up to (0, 2), as it is the only viable option that brings me closer to the goal.

My next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: (0, 1) is empty
- Down: (0, 3) is empty
- Left: (0, 1) is empty
- Right: blocked by wall (1, 2)

Since I need to move towards the goal (3, 0), I will choose to move left to (0, 1), as it is a viable option that brings me closer to the left edge of the maze, which is necessary to reach the goal.

My next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: (0, 0) is empty
- Down: (0, 2) is empty
- Left: (0, 0) is empty
- Right: blocked by wall (1, 1)

Since I need to move towards the goal (3, 0), I will choose to move left to (0, 0), as it is a viable option that brings me closer to the left edge of the maze and also closer to the goal's y-coordinate (0).

My next move is to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: none (already at the top edge)
- Down: (0, 1) is empty
- Left: none (already at the left edge)
- Right: (1, 0) is empty

Since I need to move towards the goal (3, 0), I will choose to move right to (1, 0), as it is a viable option that brings me closer to the goal's x-coordinate (3).

My next move is to (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)

Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: none (already at the top edge)
- Down: blocked by wall (1, 1)
- Left: (0, 0) is empty
- Right: (2, 0) is empty

Since I need to move towards the goal (3, 0), I will choose to move right to (2, 0), as it is a viable option that brings me closer to the goal's x-coordinate (3).

My next move is to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)

Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: none (already at the top edge)
- Down: blocked by wall (2, 1)
- Left: (1, 0) is empty
- Right: (3, 0) is the goal, but I need to check if it's empty

Since the goal (3, 0) is adjacent to my current position and there is no wall blocking the path, I will choose to move right to (3, 0).

My next move is to (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form a U-shape, similar to the original maze.
