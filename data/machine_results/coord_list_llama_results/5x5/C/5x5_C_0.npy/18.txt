You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (0, 2). The adjacent empty spaces are:

* Up: (0, 1)
* Down: None (wall at (0, 4) and no empty space at (0, 3) is not directly below)
* Left: None (no empty space at (-1, 2), out of bounds)
* Right: (0, 3)

My next move will be to the right, to the empty space at (0, 3).

Next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (0, 3). The adjacent empty spaces are:

* Up: (0, 2)
* Down: None (wall at (0, 4))
* Left: (0, 2)
* Right: None (no empty space at (0, 4), wall)

However, I also notice that I can move up to (0, 2) and then potentially left to (0, 1) or (0, 0), but I also see that (1, 0) is empty and if I can get there, I can move down to (2, 0) and then (3, 0) which is the goal.

My next move will be to move up to the empty space at (0, 2) to create more possibilities for the next move.

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (0, 2). The adjacent empty spaces are:

* Up: (0, 1)
* Down: (0, 3)
* Left: (0, 1)
* Right: None (wall at (1, 2))

I also notice that I can move left to (0, 1) and then potentially left to (0, 0), but I also see that (1, 0) is empty and if I can get there, I can move down to (2, 0) and then (3, 0) which is the goal.

My next move will be to move left to the empty space at (0, 1).

Next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (0, 1). The adjacent empty spaces are:

* Up: None (no empty space at (-1, 1), out of bounds)
* Down: (0, 2)
* Left: (0, 0)
* Right: None (wall at (1, 1))

I also notice that I can move left to (0, 0), but that doesn't seem to bring me closer to the goal. However, I can move down to (0, 2), but that also doesn't seem to bring me closer to the goal.

Wait, I can move left to (0, 0) and then potentially down is not an option, but I can see that (1, 0) is empty and if I can get there, I can move down to (2, 0) and then (3, 0) which is the goal.

My next move will be to move left to the empty space at (0, 0).

Next move: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)

* Left: None (no empty space at (-1, 0), out of bounds)
* Right: (1, 0)

I notice that I can move right to (1, 0), which brings me closer to the goal. From (1, 0), I can potentially move down to (2, 0) and then (3, 0) which is the goal.

My next move will be to move right to the empty space at (1, 0).

Next move: (1, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original. The empty spaces form a U-shape, similar to the original maze.
