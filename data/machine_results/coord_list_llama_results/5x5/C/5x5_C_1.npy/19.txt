You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will analyze the given information and plan a step-by-step path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Given the current player position is (3, 1) and the goal is (1, 3), I will first look for the nearest empty space that can bring me closer to the goal. Since I can move up, down, left, or right, I will examine all adjacent empty spaces.

From the given empty spaces, the adjacent ones to the current player position (3, 1) are (2, 1) and (4, 1). To move closer to the goal (1, 3), I should move towards (2, 1) because it reduces the distance to the goal in the vertical direction.

Therefore, my next move will be to the coordinates (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2, 1), I need to plan my next move to get closer to the goal (1, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to my current position.

The adjacent empty spaces to (2, 1) are (1, 1) and (3, 1) in the horizontal direction, but I can also consider moving up or down if it brings me closer to the goal. However, moving up is blocked by a wall at (2, 0), and moving down is not beneficial as it would increase the distance to the goal.

Between (1, 1) and (3, 1), moving to (1, 1) reduces the distance to the goal in the horizontal direction, making it a better choice.

Therefore, my next move will be to the coordinates (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1, 1), I'm in the same column as the goal (1, 3), so I should focus on moving up or down to reach the goal.

Since the goal is below my current position, I will examine the adjacent empty spaces in the downward direction. I see that (1, 2) is an empty space, which brings me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move will be to the coordinates (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1, 2), I'm just one step away from the goal (1, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces, but since I'm so close to the goal, I will focus on moving directly to it.

Unfortunately, the maze doesn't explicitly list (1, 3) as an empty space, but since it's the goal position, I assume it's reachable. Therefore, my next move will be to the coordinates (1, 3), which should bring me to the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is an "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original. The empty spaces form an L-shape, similar to the original maze.
