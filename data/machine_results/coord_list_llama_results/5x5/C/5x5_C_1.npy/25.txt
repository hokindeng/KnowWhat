You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will analyze the given information and plan a step-by-step path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Given the current player position is (3, 1) and the goal is (1, 3), and considering the layout of the walls and empty spaces, the first move should aim to get closer to the goal while avoiding walls and staying on the path.

From (3, 1), the possible moves are up, down, left, or right. However, moving up or left would hit a wall, and moving down would not get us closer to the goal. Therefore, the best initial move is to the right, towards the empty spaces that can potentially lead to the goal.

However, since (3, 2) and (3, 3) are walls, and moving directly right from (3, 1) is not possible, we need to reconsider the approach. The correct approach involves moving down to (4, 1), which is an empty space and provides a path that can eventually lead to the goal by navigating around the walls.

Thus, the coordinates of my next move would be (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the current player position at (4, 1), the goal is still to reach (1, 3). Since we are now at the bottom row of the maze that is accessible, the logical move is to start moving towards the goal by going up or moving right to find a path up.

Moving right to (4, 2) is a viable option as it is an empty space and could potentially provide a path up towards the goal in subsequent moves.

Thus, the coordinates of my next move would be (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the current player position at (4, 2), the next move should continue to aim towards reaching the goal at (1, 3). Since moving up directly from (4, 2) is blocked by walls, we need to find an alternative path.

A viable option is to move right to (4, 3), which is an empty space. This move does not immediately bring us closer to the goal but sets up the potential for a move up in the subsequent steps, as we will be looking for a way to navigate around the walls to reach the goal.

Thus, the coordinates of my next move would be (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the current player position at (4, 3), we have reached the rightmost accessible column. The next move should aim to move up towards the goal at (1, 3).

However, moving directly up from (4, 3) is blocked by walls. We need to backtrack to find a path up. The only viable option is to move left to (4, 2), which is an empty space. This move sets up the potential for finding an alternative path up in the subsequent steps.

Thus, the coordinates of my next move would be (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the current player position at (4, 2), we need to continue looking for a path up towards the goal at (1, 3).

Since moving up directly from (4, 2) is blocked by walls, and moving right would put us back at (4, 3) which we already explored, we should consider moving left. Moving left to (4, 1) is a viable option as it is an empty space. This move sets up the potential for finding an alternative path up in the subsequent steps.

Thus, the coordinates of my next move would be (4, 1).

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the current player position at (4, 1), we need to continue looking for a path up towards the goal at (1, 3).

Since moving up directly from (4, 1) is not blocked by a wall at (3, 1), we can move up to (3, 1). This move brings us closer to the goal and sets up the potential for further progress in the subsequent steps.

Thus, the coordinates of my next move would be (3, 1).

Thus, the coordinates of my next move would be (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)

Thus, the coordinates of my next move would be (1, 3). This move should complete the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape, but more generally, it can be described as an "L-shape" with some additional turns.

However, upon closer inspection, the empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "hook" or a "J-shape". This shape is characterized by a long vertical or horizontal segment with a shorter perpendicular segment at one end.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "hook" or "J-shape":

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a "hook" or "J-shape", similar to the original maze.
