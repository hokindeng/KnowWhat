You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (4, 1), and the adjacent empty spaces are (4, 2) and (3, 1).

Since the goal position is (4, 3), I will move to the empty space that is closest to the goal position. In this case, I will move to (4, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4, 2), I need to find a way to get to the goal position (4, 3). However, I notice that (4, 3) is not in the list of empty spaces, which means it's not directly accessible from my current position.

Since I'm already at the correct x-coordinate (4), I'll try to move up or down to find an alternative path. Unfortunately, moving up to (3, 2) is not possible because (3, 2) is a wall.

My only option is to move back to (4, 1) or move to (4, 4), but neither of these moves gets me closer to the goal. Wait, I can try to move to (3, 1) and then find a way to move right.

However, I notice that I can move to (4, 4) and then try to find a way to move up to the goal, but there is no empty space at (3, 4) or (3, 3), so that path is blocked.

Let me try to move to (3, 1) and see if I can find a path from there.

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3, 1), I need to find a way to get to the goal position (4, 3). Since I'm at the correct y-coordinate (1) for the empty space column, I can try to move up or down to find an alternative path.

However, moving up to (2, 1) is possible, and from there, I can try to find a way to move right. Moving down to (4, 1) is also possible, but I've already been there, and I know that path doesn't lead directly to the goal.

Let me try to move up to (2, 1) and see if I can find a path from there.

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2, 1), I need to find a way to get to the goal position (4, 3). Since I'm at a dead end in the column, I can only move up or down.

Moving up to (1, 1) is possible, and from there, I can try to find a way to move right. Let me try to move up to (1, 1) and see if I can find a path from there.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1, 1), I need to find a way to get to the goal position (4, 3). Since I'm at the top row of the empty space column, I can try to move right.

Moving right to (1, 2) is possible, and from there, I can try to find a way to move down. Let me try to move right to (1, 2) and see if I can find a path from there.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1, 2), I need to find a way to get to the goal position (4, 3). Since I'm blocked by a wall to the right and down, I can only move up or left, but moving up or left won't get me closer to the goal.

However, I can try to move right and up in a way, by moving to (1, 3) and then see if I can find a path from there.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1, 3), I need to find a way to get to the goal position (4, 3). Since I'm at the correct y-coordinate (3) for the goal, I can try to move down.

However, moving down to (2, 3) is not possible because (2, 3) is a wall. Moving down to (3, 3) is also not possible because (3, 3) is a wall. Moving down to (4, 3) is the goal, but I'm not adjacent to it.

I can try to move to (1, 4) and then see if I can find a path from there.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1, 4), I need to find a way to get to the goal position (4, 3). Since I'm at the top-right corner of the maze, I can try to move down.

Moving down to (2, 4) is not possible because (2, 4) is a wall. Moving down to (3, 4) is also not possible because (3, 4) is a wall. However, I can move down to (4, 4) because it's an empty space.

From (4, 4), I might be able to find a way to move left to the goal position (4, 3).

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 4)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original maze, and the empty spaces form a zigzag shape that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal position. The maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it has a similar shape and structure.
