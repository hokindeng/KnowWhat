You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (4, 1), and the goal is (4, 3). Since I can move only through empty spaces, I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (4, 1) are:

- Up: Not possible, as (3, 1) is the only empty space above, but it's not directly above (4, 1) in a way that would bring us closer to the goal in an optimal manner.
- Down: Not possible, as there is no empty space below (4, 1).
- Left: Not possible, as there is a wall to the left of (4, 1).
- Right: Possible, as (4, 2) is an empty space.

Moving right to (4, 2) seems to be the best option, as it brings the player closer to the goal (4, 3).

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 2), I need to find the next best move to reach the goal (4, 3).

The possible moves from (4, 2) are:

- Up: Not possible, as there is a wall above (4, 2).
- Down: Not possible, as there is no empty space below (4, 2).
- Left: Possible, as (4, 1) is an empty space, but it would move me away from the goal.
- Right: Not directly possible, as the goal (4, 3) is not an empty space that I can confirm, but since the goal is the target, I will assume it is the correct move.

However, I notice that the goal (4, 3) is not listed as an empty space. I will assume that the goal is a special case and it is possible to move into it.

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape, but more specifically, it resembles an "L-shape" or a "bent corridor" with some additional empty spaces.

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the empty spaces form a rough "C-shape" or a "hook-like" shape, with the player starting at one end of the hook and the goal at the other end.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "C-shape" or "hook-like" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form a similar "C-shape" or "hook-like" shape, with the player starting at one end of the hook and the goal at the other end.
