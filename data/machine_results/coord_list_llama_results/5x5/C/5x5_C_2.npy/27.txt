You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (4, 1), and the adjacent empty spaces are (4, 2) and (3, 1).

Since the goal position is (4, 3), I will move to the empty space that is closest to the goal position. In this case, I will move to (4, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4, 2), I need to find a way to move closer to the goal position (4, 3). However, I notice that the space directly to the right of me, (4, 3), is the goal position, but it's not listed as an empty space. This means that I need to find an alternative route.

Upon examining the maze, I see that I can move up to (3, 2), but that's a wall. I can move down, but that's outside the maze. I can move left to (4, 1), but that's not closer to the goal. The only viable option is to move right, but since (4, 3) is not an empty space, I'll try to move to the next available empty space in that direction.

The next available empty space in the right direction is not directly adjacent, so I'll have to move in a different direction first. I can move up to (3, 1) and then try to find a way to the goal from there.

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3, 1), I need to find a way to move closer to the goal position (4, 3). Since I moved up from (4, 2), I'll try to find a way to move right and then down to reach the goal.

However, I notice that the space directly to the right of me, (3, 2), is a wall. I can move up, but that's outside the maze. I can move left, but that's not closer to the goal. The only viable option is to move down to (4, 1), which is an empty space.

From (4, 1), I can try to move right to (4, 2) and then to (4, 3), but since (4, 3) is not an empty space, I'll have to re-evaluate my options when I get to (4, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4, 1), I need to find a way to move closer to the goal position (4, 3). Since I've been to (4, 2) before, I know that it's a viable option. I'll move right to (4, 2) and then re-evaluate my options.

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4, 2), I need to find a way to move closer to the goal position (4, 3). However, I notice that the space directly to the right of me, (4, 3), is the goal position, but it's not listed as an empty space. This is a problem, as I've reached a point where I should be able to move directly to the goal.

Since I've explored all other options, I'll assume that the goal position (4, 3) is actually an empty space, and I'll move there.

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original maze, and the empty spaces form a zigzag shape that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal position. The maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it has a similar shape and structure.
