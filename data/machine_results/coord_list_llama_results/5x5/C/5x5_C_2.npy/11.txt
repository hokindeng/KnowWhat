You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (4, 1), and the goal is (4, 3). Since I can move only through empty spaces, I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (4, 1) are:

- Up: Not possible, as (3, 1) is the only empty space above, but it's not the best move to reach the goal.
- Down: Not possible, as there is no empty space below.
- Left: Not possible, as there is a wall to the left.
- Right: Possible, as (4, 2) is an empty space and it's closer to the goal.

My next move will be to the right, to the position (4, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4, 2), I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces to determine the best move.

The possible moves from (4, 2) are:

- Up: Not possible, as there is a wall above.
- Down: Not possible, as there is no empty space below.
- Left: Possible, as (4, 1) is an empty space, but it's not the best move to reach the goal.
- Right: The goal is to the right, but (4, 3) is not in the list of empty spaces. However, I can try to move to the right, as it's the most direct path to the goal.

Wait, there is no empty space at (4, 3), which means it's a wall or an unknown space. But the goal is at (4, 3). This is a contradiction. Since the goal is at (4, 3) and it's not an empty space, I will assume that the maze is not correctly represented, or there is a hidden path.

However, based on the given information, I will try to move to the only available empty space that can potentially lead me to the goal. I will move to the empty space (4, 4) and then try to find an alternative path to the goal.

My next move will be to the right, to the position (4, 4), and then I will reassess the situation.

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L-shape" or a "corner shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form an L-shape, similar to the original maze.
