You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (4, 1), and the goal is (4, 3). Since I can move only through empty spaces, I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (4, 1) are:

- Up: Not possible, as (3, 1) is the only empty space above, but it's not directly above (4, 1) in a way that would help us move towards the goal directly, and moving up would require a subsequent move to the right, which is blocked by walls.
- Down: Not possible, as there are no empty spaces below (4, 1).
- Left: Not possible, as there are no empty spaces to the left of (4, 1).
- Right: Possible, as (4, 2) is an empty space.

Moving right to (4, 2) seems to be the best option, as it brings me closer to the goal (4, 3).

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 2), I need to find a way to reach the goal (4, 3). However, I notice that (4, 3) is not in the list of empty spaces. This means that (4, 3) is actually a wall or an unknown space, but since it's the goal, I will assume it's a reachable space.

Given the current situation, I will try to move to the goal directly. If that's not possible, I will explore other options.

The possible moves from (4, 2) are:

- Up: Not possible, as there are no empty spaces above (4, 2) that would help me move towards the goal.
- Down: Not possible, as there are no empty spaces below (4, 2).
- Left: Possible, but moving left would take me away from the goal.
- Right: This would be the direct move to the goal, but since (4, 3) is not in the list of empty spaces, I'm not sure if it's allowed. However, I will try to move right to (4, 3) as it's the most direct path to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape, but more specifically, it resembles an "L-shape" or an "inverted L-shape" with some additional corridors.

However, if I had to choose a more general shape, I would say that the empty spaces form a "bent tunnel" or a "bent corridor" shape, as it has a clear entrance and exit, and a winding path that connects them.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "bent tunnel" or "bent corridor" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a "bent tunnel" or "bent corridor" shape, similar to the original maze.
