You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (4, 1), and the goal is (2, 0). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves from (4, 1) are:
- Up: (3, 1) is a wall, so it's not possible.
- Down: (5, 1) is out of bounds, so it's not possible.
- Left: (4, 0) is an empty space.
- Right: (4, 2) is an empty space.

Since the goal is (2, 0), which is to the left and up from the current position, I will choose to move left to (4, 0) as the next step. This move gets me closer to the goal and keeps my options open for the next move.

The coordinates of my next move are (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (4, 0), and the goal is (2, 0). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves from (4, 0) are:
- Up: (3, 0) is an empty space.
- Down: (5, 0) is out of bounds, so it's not possible.
- Left: (3, -1) is out of bounds, so it's not possible, and even if I could move left, I would need to move up first.
- Right: (4, 1) is an empty space.

Since the goal is (2, 0), which is to the left and up from the current position, I will choose to move up to (3, 0) as the next step. This move gets me closer to the goal and keeps my options open for the next move.

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (3, 0), and the goal is (2, 0). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves from (3, 0) are:
- Up: (2, 0) is the goal position.
- Down: (4, 0) is an empty space, but it would move me away from the goal.
- Left: (2, -1) is out of bounds, so it's not possible.
- Right: (3, 1) is a wall, so it's not possible.

Since the goal is (2, 0), which is directly up from the current position, I will choose to move up to (2, 0) as the next step. This move will take me directly to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form an L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original. The empty spaces form an L-shape, similar to the original maze.
