You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (4, 1), and the adjacent empty spaces are (4, 0) and (4, 2).

Since the goal position is (2, 0), I will move towards the left to get closer to the goal. Therefore, my next move will be to the empty space (4, 0).

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. The only adjacent empty space is (3, 0).

Since the goal position is (2, 0), I will move towards the top to get closer to the goal. Therefore, my next move will be to the empty space (3, 0).

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces and the goal position. The goal position (2, 0) is directly above me, but it's not an empty space in the list. However, I can infer that it's not a wall either, since it's the goal position.

I will move towards the top to reach the goal position. Therefore, my next move will be to the goal position (2, 0).

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form an L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form an L-shape, similar to the original maze.
