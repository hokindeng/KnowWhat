You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 2), and the goal is to reach position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the current position (2, 2), we need to find adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are constrained by the need to avoid walls and only move through empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the goal is at (4, 4) and the available empty spaces, the best strategy is to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. The closest empty space that moves us in the direction of the goal and is not blocked by a wall is (2, 4) or (3, 3). However, since we can only choose one next move, we should select the one that seems most direct or strategic given the layout.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the constraints and the goal, moving to (3, 3) seems like a strategic choice because it moves us closer to the goal and opens up possibilities for the next move, considering the diagonal movement is allowed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (3, 3). The goal remains at (4, 4).

## Step 2: Identify new possible moves
Given the new position (3, 3), we look for adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are to (2, 2), (2, 4), or (4, 2), as these are the empty spaces closest to the current position.

## Step 3: Determine the best next move towards the goal
Considering the goal is at (4, 4), the best move is one that gets us closer to the goal while avoiding walls. Moving to (4, 2) seems like the most strategic choice because it moves us closer to the goal's x-coordinate and sets us up for a potential next move closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Given the constraints and the goal, moving to (4, 2) is the best choice because it advances us towards the goal and keeps future options open.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the new position and options
The player is now at (4, 2), and the goal is still at (4, 4). We need to find a way to move closer to the goal.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
Given the current position (4, 2), we look for adjacent empty spaces that can bring us closer to the goal. However, there are no empty spaces directly adjacent to (4, 2) that move us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

## Step 3: Consider indirect moves
Since direct moves towards the goal are blocked, we need to consider moving back to a position that could offer a path forward. The empty spaces at (2, 2), (2, 4), and (3, 3) are options, but we need to choose one that could lead to a future move closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose a strategic move
Given the goal is at (4, 4) and considering the layout, moving to (3, 3) might not be the best option since it doesn't directly lead us closer to the goal. Moving to (2, 4) could be strategic because it keeps the option open to potentially move closer to the goal in a future step, considering diagonal movements.

## Step 5: Decide on the next move
Considering the constraints and the goal, moving to (2, 4) seems like a strategic choice because it keeps future options open and could potentially lead to a move closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze form a diagonal or a zigzag pattern that allows movement from the player's position to the goal. However, if we look closely, the empty spaces (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2) form a general shape that can be described as a diagonal line or a staircase, enabling the player to move from one corner to the opposite corner.

## Step 2: Determine the specific shape
Given the arrangement of the empty spaces, the specific shape can be more accurately described as a "staircase" because it resembles the steps of a staircase, allowing diagonal movement across the maze.

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same shape of empty spaces
To create a new maze with the same "staircase" shape of empty spaces, we need to ensure the maze is the same size (5x5) and includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces that form a staircase shape. The new maze should not be an identical copy of the original.

## Step 4: Design the new maze
The new maze will have walls and empty spaces arranged differently but will maintain a staircase shape for the empty spaces to allow a path from P to G.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze
Here is the new maze encoded in the same format as the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

However, to strictly follow the format requested for the final answer, which seems to expect a numerical solution, and given the instructions were to solve a maze and then generate a new one with specific characteristics rather than solve for a number, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the request for the final format. Since the task involves describing a shape and generating a new maze rather than solving for a numerical value, I will provide the answer in the requested format but clarify that the solution involves descriptive and creative elements rather than numerical ones.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$
