You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only to empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 2), and the goal is to reach position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (2, 2), we need to look at the empty spaces to determine the best possible move. The empty spaces are at (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2). Since we can move in any of the eight directions, we need to find the move that brings us closer to the goal (4, 4) while avoiding walls.

## Step 4: Choose the best move
Looking at the empty spaces, moving to (3, 3) seems to be the most logical step as it is closer to the goal (4, 4) compared to the other options and allows for further movement in the direction of the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze are at (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2). By visualizing these points, it appears that the general shape formed by these empty spaces is a diagonal line or a staircase pattern from the top-right to the bottom-left of the maze, but given the limited number of empty spaces, it more specifically resembles a diagonal line with a slight deviation. However, considering the context and the goal of creating a new maze with a similar shape, we can interpret the intended shape as a diagonal line or a "staircase" pattern due to the constraints of the maze layout and the goal of reaching from P to G.

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same size and a similar shape for the empty spaces
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it is the same size as the original (5x5), includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original, and forms a similar "staircase" or diagonal pattern with its empty spaces.

## Step 3: Define the new maze's walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal
Given the constraints and the goal, we can define the new maze as follows:
- Walls: We will adjust the walls to create a new path but maintain the maze's size and ensure the path from P to G is valid.
- Empty spaces: We will create a new set of empty spaces that form a diagonal or "staircase" pattern but are not identical to the original.
- Player position and Goal: These will be placed at the start and end of the new path, respectively.

## Step 4: Specify the new maze
New Maze:
- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
- Empty: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3)
- Player position: (1, 2)
- Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze maintains the same size, offers a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original, and its empty spaces form a diagonal or "staircase" pattern.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1. Staircase or Diagonal}$
