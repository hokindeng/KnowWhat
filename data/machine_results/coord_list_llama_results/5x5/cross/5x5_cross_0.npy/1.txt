You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move. Based on the current player position (2, 2) and the available empty spaces, my next move will be to the position (2, 4), which is adjacent to my current position and is an empty space.

Next move coordinates: (2, 4)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position and let me know the updated state of the maze.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I conclude that:

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "**Staircase**".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar Staircase shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, and its empty spaces form a similar Staircase shape. The player can navigate from the current position (2, 2) to the goal position (4, 4) through the empty spaces.
