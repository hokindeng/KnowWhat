You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 2), and the goal is to reach position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (2, 2), we need to look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are at (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2). However, we can only consider moves that are directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to our current position.

## Step 4: Choose the best next move
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal position, the best move would be to move to a position that brings us closer to the goal (4, 4) while avoiding walls. The position (3, 3) is diagonally adjacent to our current position and is the closest to the goal among the available options.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player's new position at (3, 3), and the previous position (2, 2) is now considered an empty space.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (3, 3), and the goal remains at position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (3, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are now at (2, 2), (2, 4), and (4, 2). We consider moves that are directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to our current position.

## Step 4: Choose the best next move
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal position, the best move would be to move to a position that brings us closer to the goal (4, 4) while avoiding walls. The position (4, 2) is not directly adjacent to the goal but is closer than the other options and does not move us further away from the goal. However, upon closer inspection, moving to (4, 2) does not directly advance us towards the goal due to the wall at (4, 3), which blocks direct progress to (4, 4) from (4, 2). Given the constraints, we should aim to move closer to the goal by reducing the distance in either the x or y axis. However, the direct path to the goal is blocked by a wall at (3, 4) and (4, 3), making a direct approach impossible without backtracking or moving laterally first.

## Step 5: Reconsider the approach
Given the direct path to the goal is blocked, we must reconsider our approach. Moving to (2, 4) could potentially offer a path around the walls, but it moves us away from the goal in terms of the x-axis. However, considering the available moves and the goal, moving to (2, 4) might provide a future path that isn't immediately apparent due to the constraints of the maze.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player's new position at (2, 4), and we need to find a way to move closer to the goal at (4, 4).

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 4), and the goal remains at position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (2, 4), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are now at (2, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 2). We consider moves that are directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to our current position.

## Step 4: Choose the best next move
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal position, the best move would be to move to a position that brings us closer to the goal (4, 4) while avoiding walls. Since we are at (2, 4), moving to (3, 3) would be a logical step as it moves us closer to the goal in terms of the x-axis and does not move us further away in the y-axis.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player's new position at (3, 3), and we need to find a way to move closer to the goal at (4, 4).

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (3, 3), and the goal remains at position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (3, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are now at (2, 2), (2, 4), and (4, 2). We consider moves that are directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to our current position.

## Step 4: Choose the best next move
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal position, the best move would be to move to a position that brings us closer to the goal (4, 4) while avoiding walls. Since the direct path to the goal is blocked by a wall at (3, 4) and (4, 3), we need to find an alternative route. Moving to (4, 2) would be the closest we can get to the goal without hitting a wall, and it sets us up for a potential future move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player's new position at (4, 2), and we need to find a way to move closer to the goal at (4, 4).

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (4, 2), and the goal remains at position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (4, 2), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are now at (2, 2), (2, 4), and (3, 3). However, none of these spaces are directly adjacent to our current position in a way that moves us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Consider the goal's proximity
Since the goal is at (4, 4) and we are at (4, 2), we are in the same column as the goal but two spaces away in the y-axis. The wall at (4, 3) blocks our direct path to the goal.

## Step 5: Realize the limitation
Given the current state of the maze and the rules of movement, we cannot move directly to the goal due to the wall at (4, 3). However, we also cannot move to any of the empty spaces without moving away from the goal, as none of them are closer to the goal than our current position.

## Step 6: Conclude the impossibility of reaching the goal
Given the constraints of the maze and the available moves, it appears that reaching the goal from the current position is impossible without violating the rules of movement or the structure of the maze.

The final answer is: $\boxed{None}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that can be described as a "Z" shape or a zigzag pattern, considering the positions (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2) in relation to the player's starting position and the goal.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and a valid path from P to G
To create a new maze, we need to ensure it has the same size (5x5) and includes a valid path from the player's starting position (P) to the goal (G) while maintaining a "Z" shape in its empty spaces.

## Step 3: Design the new maze's empty spaces to form a "Z" shape
A new maze with a "Z" shape in its empty spaces could have the player start at (1, 1), with empty spaces at (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 4), leading to the goal at (4, 4). However, to maintain the same level of complexity and shape as the original, we will adjust the empty spaces to create a zigzag pattern similar to the original but not identical.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Let's encode the new maze with the player starting at (1, 1) and the goal at (4, 4), ensuring there's a "Z" shaped path formed by the empty spaces.

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 4)

The final answer is: 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 4)
