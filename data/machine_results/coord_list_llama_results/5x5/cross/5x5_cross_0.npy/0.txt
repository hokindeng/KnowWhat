You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 2), and the goal is to reach position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (2, 2), we need to look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are at (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2). Since we can move in any of the eight directions, we need to find which of these empty spaces is accessible from our current position.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Looking at the empty spaces, the closest and most logical move from (2, 2) would be to move to (2, 4) because it's directly accessible by moving right from the current position, and it gets us closer to the goal in a straightforward manner without hitting any walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze are at (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2). When connected, these points form a diagonal line from top-right to bottom-left. However, considering the context of the maze and the requirement to identify a "general shape," it seems more appropriate to interpret the shape in a broader sense. Given the layout and the goal of reaching from (2, 2) to (4, 4), the path resembles a part of a diagonal line but doesn't fully represent a common geometric shape like a square, circle, or triangle due to the limited number of points. For simplicity and based on the given points, we might consider the shape as a "diagonal" in a very general sense, but it's essential to note that with so few points, it's a bit of a stretch to call it a definitive geometric shape without more context.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and a similar shape for the empty spaces
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it's the same size as the original (5x5), includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original, and the empty spaces should form a similar "diagonal" shape in a general sense.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Given the constraints and the goal to replicate a "diagonal" shape, we can create a maze where the empty spaces and the path from P to G are more clearly diagonal. Let's set the player's position to (0, 0) and the goal to (4, 4), with empty spaces creating a diagonal path.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Walls will be placed to block direct horizontal and vertical paths, ensuring the diagonal path is the most straightforward route.

- Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
- Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
- Player position: (0, 0)
- Goal: (4, 4)

This setup maintains the diagonal path requirement, offers a clear path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze.

The final answer is: 
Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 4)
