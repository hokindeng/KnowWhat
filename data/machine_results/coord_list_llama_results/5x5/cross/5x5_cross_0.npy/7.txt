You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will analyze the given information and plan a step-by-step path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Current player position: (2, 2)
Goal position: (4, 4)

Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), I will look for the closest empty space that brings me closer to the goal.

The closest empty space to the current player position (2, 2) is (2, 4), which is two steps to the right, but there is a wall at (2, 3), so I need to find an alternative. Another option is to move diagonally to (3, 3), which is an empty space.

My next move will be to (3, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

Current player position: (3, 3)
Goal position: (4, 4)

Since I am now at (3, 3), I can see that the goal position (4, 4) is just one step down and one step right. However, there is a wall at (3, 4) and (4, 3), so I need to find an alternative.

A possible move is to go down to (4, 3), but it's a wall. Another option is to move diagonally to (4, 2), which is an empty space. This move doesn't bring me directly closer to the goal, but it allows me to avoid the walls and potentially find a path to the goal.

My next move will be to (4, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

Current player position: (4, 2)
Goal position: (4, 4)

Since I am now at (4, 2), I can see that the goal position (4, 4) is just two steps to the right. However, there is a wall at (4, 3), so I need to find an alternative.

A possible move is to go diagonally up to (3, 3), which is an empty space. From there, I can try to find a path to the goal.

My next move will be to (3, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)

Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

Current player position: (3, 3)
Goal position: (4, 4)

Since I am now at (3, 3), I can see that the goal position (4, 4) is just one step down and one step right. However, there is a wall at (3, 4) and (4, 3), so I need to find an alternative.

A possible move is to go diagonally up and right to (2, 4), which is an empty space. From there, I can try to find a path to the goal.

My next move will be to (2, 4).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Since I am now at (2, 4), I can see that the goal position (4, 4) is just two steps down. However, there is a wall at (3, 4), so I need to find an alternative.

A possible move is to go diagonally down and left to (3, 3), which is an empty space. From there, I can try to find a path to the goal.

My next move will be to (3, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Since I am now at (3, 3), I can see that the goal position (4, 4) is just one step down and one step right. However, there is a wall at (3, 4) and (4, 3), so I need to find an alternative.

A possible move is to go down and left to (4, 2), which is an empty space. From there, I can try to find a path to the goal.

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

Current player position: (4, 2)

Since I am now at (4, 2), I can see that the goal position (4, 4) is just two steps to the right. However, there is a wall at (4, 3), so I need to find an alternative.

Unfortunately, I don't have any other options but to go back to a previous position and try a different path. A possible move is to go diagonally up and left to (3, 3), which is an empty space. From there, I can try to find a path to the goal.

My next move will be to (3, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

Current player position: (3, 3)
Goal position: (4, 4)

Since I am now at (3, 3), I can see that the goal position (4, 4) is just one step down and one step right. However, there is a wall at (3, 4) and (4, 3), so I need to find an alternative.

Unfortunately, I've tried all possible moves and it seems that I'm stuck in a loop. I've been to (4, 2) and (3, 3) multiple times, and I don't see any other options to reach the goal.

I must conclude that the maze is unsolvable from the given starting position. There is no path that allows me to reach the goal (4, 4) without going through a wall.

Please let me know if I'm correct or if I've missed something.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Disconnected Z-shape" or a "Broken Zig-Zag". However, if I had to choose a more general shape, I would say that it resembles a "Z-shape" or a "Zig-Zag".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar Z-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is a Z-shape, similar to the original maze. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original, and the path from P to G is different.
