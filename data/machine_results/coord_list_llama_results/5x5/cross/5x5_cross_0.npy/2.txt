You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will analyze the given information and plan a step-by-step path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G).

First, let's visualize the maze:

```
Walls: 
(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)
(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)
(2, 0), (2, 1),          (2, 3)
(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2),          (3, 4)
(4, 0), (4, 1),          (4, 3)

Empty: 
                  (2, 4)
                  (3, 3)
                  (4, 2)

Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)
```

Since we can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), we'll look for the most direct path to the goal while avoiding walls.

From the current player position (2, 2), the most direct path to the goal (4, 4) would be to move diagonally down-right. However, we need to ensure that the next position is an empty space.

The closest empty space to the player position is (2, 4), which is two steps to the right. However, moving directly to (2, 4) does not bring us closer to the goal in a diagonal direction.

A better option would be to move diagonally down-right to (3, 3), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at position (3, 3), let's analyze the maze again.

We're getting close to the goal (4, 4), but we need to navigate around the walls. Since we can move in any of the eight directions, we'll look for the most direct path to the goal.

From our current position (3, 3), we can see that there's a wall to our right (3, 4) and below us (4, 3). However, there's an empty space at (4, 2), which is diagonally down-left from our current position.

Moving to (4, 2) would bring us closer to the goal and give us a chance to move up-right to the goal (4, 4) in the next step.

Therefore, my next move would be to (4, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at position (4, 2), let's analyze the maze again.

We're very close to the goal (4, 4), and we can see that there's a wall to our left (4, 1) and to our right (4, 3). However, the goal (4, 4) is just two steps to the right from our current position.

Since we can move in any of the eight directions, we can move directly to the goal (4, 4) by going two steps to the right.

Therefore, my next move would be to (4, 4), which is the goal position.

Please confirm if we've successfully solved the maze!

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "staircase" or a "zigzag" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same staircase shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, and it includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G) that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a staircase or zigzag shape.
