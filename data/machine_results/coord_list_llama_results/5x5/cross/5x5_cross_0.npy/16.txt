You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only to empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 2), and the goal is to reach position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (2, 2), we need to look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are at (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2). We can only consider moves to these positions that are directly accessible (adjacent) from the current position.

## Step 4: Choose the best next move
Considering the empty spaces, the most direct path towards the goal (4, 4) from the current position (2, 2) would involve moving to a position that gets us closer to the goal. The position (3, 3) is directly in the path towards the goal and is an empty space, making it the best next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player's new position at (3, 3), and the previous position (2, 2) is now an empty space.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (3, 3), and the goal remains at position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (3, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are now at (2, 2), (2, 4), and (4, 2). We need to find a move that brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the best next move
Considering the empty spaces and the goal position, moving directly to the goal is not possible because it is blocked by a wall at (3, 4). However, we can move diagonally to (4, 2), which gets us closer to the goal and sets us up for a potential next move closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player's new position at (4, 2), and the previous position (3, 3) is now an empty space.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (4, 2), and the goal remains at position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (4, 2), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are now at (2, 2), (2, 4), and (3, 3). However, we are now on the same row as the goal and can consider moving directly towards it if there are no walls in the way.

## Step 4: Choose the best next move
Considering the goal position is directly to the right of the player's current position and there are no walls between the player and the goal on the x-axis, but there is a wall at (4, 3) that blocks the direct path, we cannot move directly to the goal. However, we can move diagonally up to (3, 3) and then reassess for a path to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

The player is currently at position (3, 3), and the goal remains at position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (3, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are now at (2, 2), (2, 4), and (4, 2). However, we are now close to the goal and need to find a move that gets us closer.

## Step 4: Choose the best next move
Considering the goal position and the available empty spaces, we can move diagonally to (4, 2) but that would be moving away from the goal in terms of the y-coordinate. However, moving diagonally up and right isn't an option due to the wall at (3, 4). But moving diagonally down and right to the goal is blocked by a wall at (4, 3). Since moving directly right is blocked by a wall at (3, 4), the only viable move to get closer to the goal is to move diagonally up and left to (2, 4), which doesn't directly lead to the goal but sets up a potential path.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a diagonal line or a staircase, but with some deviations. However, if we look closely, we can see that it's more like a zigzag or a modified "Z" shape.


## Step 2: Generate a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same shape.
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a zigzag or a modified "Z" shape. Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)


The final answer is: There is no numerical answer for this problem.
