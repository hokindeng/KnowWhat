You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 2), and the goal is to reach position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (2, 2), we need to look at the empty spaces to determine where we can move. The empty spaces are at (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2). Since we can move in any of the eight directions, we need to find which of these empty spaces is accessible from our current position.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Looking at the empty spaces, (3, 3) is the only position that is directly accessible from (2, 2) because it is adjacent in a diagonal direction, and it is not blocked by a wall. Moving to (3, 3) brings us closer to the goal position (4, 4) and is a valid move through an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze are at (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2). When connected, these points form a diagonal line from the top-right to the bottom-left of the maze. However, considering the overall structure and the goal of finding a path, the shape can be seen as a part of a larger diagonal line or a very simplified "staircase" but given the limited points, it's more accurate to describe it as a diagonal line.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and a path forming the same general shape
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it's the same size (5x5) and has a path from P to G that resembles a diagonal line. We will place the empty spaces, player position, and goal in such a way that they form a new path but maintain the diagonal line shape.

## Step 3: Define the new maze's walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal
Given the constraints and the aim to replicate the diagonal line shape, we can define the new maze as follows:

- Walls will be placed to block direct paths and ensure the maze requires navigation through the diagonal line.
- Empty spaces will be positioned to form a diagonal line from the player's position to the goal, ensuring the path is not identical to the original maze.
- The player's position and the goal will be placed at the ends of this diagonal line.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Here is the encoding for the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

The final answer is: 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)
