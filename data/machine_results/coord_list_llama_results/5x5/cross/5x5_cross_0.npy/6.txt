You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 2), and the goal is to reach position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (2, 2), we need to identify which of the adjacent positions (including diagonals) are empty and thus valid for the next move. The possible moves are constrained by the need to avoid walls and only move through empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the goal is at (4, 4) and the layout of the maze, the best strategy is to move in a direction that gets us closer to the goal while avoiding walls. Since the player is at (2, 2) and there are walls directly to the right and below the player, we need to find a path that navigates around these obstacles.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the constraints and the goal, moving diagonally down and to the right would be ideal, but since (3, 3) is an empty space and moving directly to (3, 3) is not possible due to the wall at (3, 2), we need to find an alternative. The closest empty space that allows progress towards the goal without backtracking is (2, 4), as moving up is not an option due to the wall above the player.

## Step 6: Confirm the move
The move to (2, 4) is confirmed as it is an empty space adjacent to the player's current position and moves the player closer to the goal without violating the maze's rules.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze form a diagonal line from (2, 4) to (3, 3) to (4, 2) which can be considered a part of a larger diagonal line that would connect the player's position (2, 2) to the goal (4, 4) if not for the intervening walls. Thus, the general shape can be described as a "diagonal line" or more broadly, a "staircase" pattern due to the step-like progression through the maze.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape of empty spaces
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it is the same size (5x5) and has a path from the player's position to the goal that resembles a "staircase" or "diagonal line" without being an identical copy of the original maze.

## Step 3: Determine the new positions of walls and empty spaces
Given the need for a "staircase" pattern, we can mirror the original maze's empty spaces across the vertical axis or create a new diagonal path. A simple approach is to shift the diagonal path up or down and adjust the walls accordingly to ensure the maze remains solvable and distinct from the original.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Let's create a new maze where the empty spaces form a similar "staircase" pattern but are positioned differently. We can place the player at (1, 1) and the goal at (3, 3), creating a diagonal path through (2, 2).

## Step 5: Define the new maze's walls and empty spaces
Walls could be placed at positions that block direct horizontal or vertical movement to the goal, ensuring the player must use the diagonal path. However, since we need to provide a complete maze, we'll define walls and empty spaces that adhere to the criteria but allow for a straightforward solution.

## Step 6: Finalize the new maze
Given the constraints and the goal of creating a maze with a similar "staircase" pattern, we define the new maze as follows:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

This maze maintains the "staircase" or "diagonal line" shape formed by its empty spaces, is solvable, and is not an identical copy of the original maze.

The final answer is:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)
