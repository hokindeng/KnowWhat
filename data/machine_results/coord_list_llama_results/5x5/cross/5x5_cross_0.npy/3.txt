You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will analyze the given information and plan a step-by-step path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Current player position: (2, 2)
Goal position: (4, 4)

Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), I will look for the closest empty space that brings me closer to the goal.

The closest empty space to the current player position (2, 2) is (2, 4), which is two steps to the right, or (3, 3), which is one step down and one step to the right. However, since (3, 3) is closer to the goal and more directly aligned with it, I will choose to move to (3, 3).

Next move: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the new situation.

Current player position: (3, 3)
Goal position: (4, 4)

Since I am now at (3, 3), I need to find a way to move closer to the goal. The closest empty space that brings me closer to the goal is (4, 2), but it's not directly aligned with the goal. However, I can move to (4, 2) and then try to find a way to move up to the goal.

Another option is to try to move directly to the goal, but there is a wall at (3, 4) and (4, 3), so I need to find a way to go around it.

Considering the options, I will move to (4, 2), which is one step down and one step to the left, and then try to find a way to move up to the goal.

Next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the new situation.

Current player position: (4, 2)
Goal position: (4, 4)

Since I am now at (4, 2), I can see that the goal is two steps to the right. However, there is a wall at (4, 3) that blocks my direct path to the goal.

I will look for an alternative route. I can move up to (3, 3), which is an empty space, and then try to find a way to move down to the goal. But I already know that (3, 4) is a wall, so that's not a viable option.

Another option is to move to (2, 4), which is two steps up and two steps to the right, and then try to find a way to move down to the goal. However, this would require backtracking, and I'd rather try to find a more direct route.

Wait, I can move diagonally! I can move diagonally up and to the right to (3, 3), and then diagonally down and to the right to the goal. But that's not necessary, I can move diagonally up and to the right to (2, 4) and then diagonally down and to the left is not an option, but I can move diagonally down and to the right to the goal from (2, 4) is not an option either.

However I can move diagonally to (3, 3) and then I will be back to the previous position, or I can try to move to (2, 4) and then I will be 2 steps away, and then try to move to the goal.

Considering the options, I will move diagonally up and to the right to (2, 4).

Next move: (2, 4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "staircase" or a "zigzag" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same staircase or zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a staircase or zigzag shape.
