You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will analyze the given information and plan a step-by-step path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Current player position: (2, 2)
Goal position: (4, 4)

Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), I will look for the closest empty space to the goal position.

The closest empty space to the goal position is (4, 2), but I need to find a path to get there from the current player position (2, 2). I notice that (3, 3) is an empty space that is adjacent to the current player position.

My next move will be to (3, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 3), I need to find a way to get closer to the goal position (4, 4). I notice that (4, 2) is an empty space that is adjacent to my current position, and it's also closer to the goal.

However, I also notice that (2, 4) is an empty space that is diagonally adjacent to my current position, and it's also a good option to consider. But since my goal is to move towards the goal position (4, 4), I think it's better to move towards the right side of the maze.

My next move will be to (4, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 2), I'm close to the goal position (4, 4). However, I notice that there is a wall at (4, 3) that blocks my direct path to the goal.

Since I can move diagonally, I can try to move to (3, 3) and then find a way to get to the goal from there. But I've already been to (3, 3) before, and I know that it's not a straightforward path to the goal from there.

Instead, I notice that (2, 4) is an empty space that is diagonally adjacent to my current position. If I move to (2, 4), I might be able to find a way to get to the goal from there.

However, I realize that moving to (2, 4) would actually take me further away from the goal. A better option would be to wait for a better opportunity to move directly towards the goal.

But since I need to make a move, I will try to move to (3, 3) and reassess my options from there.

My next move will be to (3, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (3, 3). Since I've already been here before, I know that my options are limited. However, I notice that (2, 4) is an empty space that is diagonally adjacent to my current position.

Moving to (2, 4) might not seem like the most direct path to the goal, but it's a viable option. From (2, 4), I might be able to find a way to get to the goal, or at least get closer to it.

My next move will be to (2, 4).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 4), I need to find a way to get closer to the goal position (4, 4). Since I can move diagonally, I notice that the goal position is actually diagonally adjacent to my current position, but there is a wall at (3, 4) that blocks my direct path.

However, I also notice that the goal position is also diagonally adjacent to the empty space at (3, 3). If I can get to (3, 3), I might be able to move to the goal position from there.

My next move will be to (3, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (3, 3) again. Since I've already been here before, I know that my options are limited. However, I notice that the goal position (4, 4) is diagonally adjacent to my current position, but there is a wall at (3, 4) that blocks my direct path.

However, I also notice that the goal position is adjacent to the empty space that would be at (4, 3) if it weren't a wall, and the empty space at (4, 2). If I can get to (4, 2), I might not be able to move directly to the goal, but I will be closer.

Wait, I was already at (4, 2) and I backtracked to (3, 3). I should try to move directly to the goal.

My next move will be to (4, 4).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Z" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a "Z" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 2)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it has the same size and a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, forming a "Z" shape.
