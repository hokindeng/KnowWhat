You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will analyze the given information and plan a step-by-step path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Current player position: (2, 2)
Goal position: (4, 4)

Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), I will look for the closest empty space that brings me closer to the goal.

The closest empty space to the current player position (2, 2) is (2, 4), which is two steps to the right, but there is a wall at (2, 3), so I need to find an alternative. Another option is to move diagonally to (3, 3), which is an empty space.

My next move will be to (3, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3, 3), I need to find a way to get closer to the goal (4, 4). Since there's a wall at (3, 4), I need to find an alternative route.

I notice that there's an empty space at (4, 2), which is diagonally down and to the left from my current position. However, moving to (4, 2) would not bring me closer to the goal. Instead, I'll look for a way to move closer to the goal.

A possible move is to go down to (4, 3), but it's a wall. Another option is to move diagonally down and to the right, but that would put me outside the maze.

The best option seems to be to move to (2, 4), which is an empty space, and then try to find a way to move down towards the goal. However, since I'm trying to move closer to the goal, I'll try to find a more direct path.

Wait, I can move to (2, 4) and then I'll be stuck, or I can try to find another way. Let me rethink this... 

A better option would be to move to (2, 4) and then try to find a way to move down, but I think I can do better than that.

My next move will be to (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2, 4), I need to find a way to get closer to the goal (4, 4). Since I'm at the top-right part of the maze, I need to move down.

I notice that there's a wall at (3, 4), so I need to find an alternative route. I can move diagonally down and to the left to (3, 3), which is an empty space. From there, I can try to find a way to move down towards the goal.

My next move will be to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at position (3, 3). Since I've already been here before, I know that I need to find a way to move down towards the goal.

I notice that there's an empty space at (4, 2), which is diagonally down and to the left from my current position. I can move there and then try to find a way to move right towards the goal.

My next move will be to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4, 2), I'm close to the goal. I need to find a way to move right towards the goal.

Since there's a wall at (4, 3), I need to find an alternative route. However, I notice that the goal (4, 4) is only two steps to the right from my current position.

Unfortunately, I'm blocked by the wall at (4, 3), and I don't have any other options to move right. But I can try to move diagonally up and to the right to (3, 3), and then try to find another way, or I can try to move diagonally up and to the right to (3, 4) but there is a wall, so that is not an option.

Wait, I have another idea. Since I'm already at (4, 2), I can try to move directly to the goal (4, 4), but there is a wall in the way at (4, 3). So that is not possible.

My only option is to move diagonally up and to the right to (3, 3), and then try to find another way.

My next move will be to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at position (3, 3) again. Since I've already been here before, I know that I need to find a way to move down towards the goal.

However, I've already tried moving down and to the right, and I ended up back here. This time, I'll try to think of a different approach.

I notice that I can move diagonally up and to the right to (2, 4), but that would take me away from the goal. I can also move diagonally down and to the left to (4, 2), but I've already been there before.

Wait, I have an idea. Since I'm at (3, 3), I can try to move directly down to (4, 3), but there is a wall. However, I can try to move diagonally down and to the right to (4, 4), which is the goal.

My next move will be to (4, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Z-shape" or a "zig-zag" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same Z-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as a Z-shape or a zig-zag shape.
