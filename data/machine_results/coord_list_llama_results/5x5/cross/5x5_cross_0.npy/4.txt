You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the next best move from the player's position (2,2) would be to move diagonally to (3,3). However, this oversight does not consider the possibility of moving to (2,4) and then reassessing the path.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's position, and the goal. The top left corner is (0,0), and movements can be up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 2: Identify the current situation
The player is at (2,2), and the goal is to reach (4,4). The walls and empty spaces are given. The player must navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal.

## Step 3: Analyze possible next moves
From (2,2), possible moves are limited due to surrounding walls. The player can only move to (2,4) since it is the only adjacent empty space.

## Step 4: Consider the shortest path to the goal
Upon reaching (2,4), the next best move would potentially involve reaching closer to the goal while navigating through empty spaces. This would potentially involve moving to (3,3) or (4,2), as they are closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Select the best next move
Given the current constraints and aiming for the shortest path, moving from (2,2) to (2,4) seems the most logical first step. Then, reassess and potentially move to (3,3) or (4,2).

## Step 6: Provide the next move
The coordinates of the next move should be to an empty space that leads closer to the goal while avoiding walls. Thus, the next move should logically be towards (2,4), given its proximity and the path it potentially opens.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original problem was correctly analyzed to determine the general shape of the corridors and a new maze was created that forms the same shape.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Determine the general shape of the corridors
The empty spaces (2,4), (3,3), and (4,2) form a diagonal line from top right to bottom left.

## Step 2: Identify the shape
The general shape of the corridors can be identified as a diagonal line.

## Step 3: Create a new maze
To create a new maze, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form the same diagonal line shape.

## Step 4: Determine the size of the maze
The original maze has a size of 5x5.

## Step 5: Create the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

However, since this new maze would be identical to the solution of the original maze, we need to create a new one that still forms a diagonal line.

## Step 6: Adjust the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 2)


## Step 7: Final Answer
Given the original prompt's instructions for formatting the answer to provide a description and then the actual answer in a very specific boxed format, I must point out that the answer is actually descriptive and not numerical. However, I will follow the instructions as closely as possible.


The final answer is: The general shape of the corridors is a diagonal line.
Walls: $\boxed{(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)}$
Empty: $\boxed{(2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2)}$
Player position: $\boxed{(2, 3)}$
Goal: $\boxed{(4, 2)}$
