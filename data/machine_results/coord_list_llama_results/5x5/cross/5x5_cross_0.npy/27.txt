You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 2), and the goal is to reach position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (2, 2), we need to look at the empty spaces to determine where the player can move. The empty spaces are at (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2). However, the player can only move to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Since the goal is at (4, 4) and we need to move closer to it, we should prioritize moves that either increase the x-coordinate or the y-coordinate or both, considering the available empty spaces. The most direct path towards the goal, given the constraints, would be to move diagonally down and right. However, since (3, 3) is the only adjacent empty space that allows us to move closer to the goal by increasing both the x and y coordinates, this would be the best move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player's new position at (3, 3), and the previous position (2, 2) is now an empty space.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (3, 3), and the goal remains at position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (3, 3), we look at the empty spaces to determine where the player can move. The empty spaces are now at (2, 2), (2, 4), and (4, 2). We need to find an adjacent empty space that moves us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the best move
Since the goal is at (4, 4) and we are at (3, 3), the most direct path would be to move diagonally down and right to (4, 4). However, this is not possible as (4, 4) is not an adjacent empty space due to the presence of a wall at (3, 4) and (4, 3), which blocks the direct diagonal path. The next best move would be to move to an empty space that increases either the x-coordinate or the y-coordinate. Given the available empty spaces, moving to (4, 2) would increase the x-coordinate, moving closer to the goal, but it does not increase the y-coordinate. However, it's the closest we can get given the constraints of the maze.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player's new position at (4, 2), and the previous position is not relevant for determining the next move.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (4, 2), and the goal remains at position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (4, 2), we look at the empty spaces to determine where the player can move. The empty spaces are now at (2, 2), (2, 4), and (3, 3). However, none of these spaces are adjacent to the player's current position.

## Step 4: Consider the goal's position
Since the goal is at (4, 4) and we are at (4, 2), we share the same x-coordinate. The only moves we need to make are those that increase the y-coordinate to reach the goal.

## Step 5: Determine the best move
Given that we cannot move directly to the goal due to the wall at (4, 3), we must find an alternative. However, upon closer inspection, there's a realization that the previous assessment of available moves was incorrect due to overlooking the possibility of moving around the wall by going back to an empty space that could provide a path around the wall. But, considering the direct path to the goal is blocked by a wall and there are no adjacent empty spaces to move into that would increase the y-coordinate without going through a wall, and given the constraints of the maze and the available empty spaces, there seems to be an oversight in the analysis regarding the direct approach to the goal.

## Step 6: Correct the analysis
Upon reevaluation, considering the direct path to the goal is blocked and the available empty spaces do not offer a straightforward move towards the goal without backtracking, the analysis should focus on finding a path that could potentially lead around the blocking wall, even if it means moving away from the goal temporarily. However, the correct realization should be that, given the maze's constraints and the goal's position relative to the player, the analysis mistakenly overlooked considering a move that directly addresses the challenge posed by the wall blocking the path to the goal.

## Step 7: Realize the oversight in analysis
Given the maze's layout and the goal's proximity, a more accurate analysis would involve considering moves that might not be directly towards the goal but could ultimately lead to it. However, the direct approach should always be the first consideration, taking into account any potential oversight in the analysis of the maze's layout and the player's possible moves.

## Step 8: Correctly determine the best move
Given the direct path is blocked and the need to reassess the approach to the goal, considering the maze's constraints and the goal's position, the analysis should correctly identify a move that aligns with the goal of reaching the destination, even if it means a more detailed examination of the maze's layout is required to find a path around the blocking wall. However, the critical realization is that the goal is blocked by a wall, and the available moves do not directly lead to the goal without navigating around the wall, which suggests a need to reconsider the approach to finding a path to the goal.

## Step 9: Final analysis and move decision
Given the complexities and the need for a detailed examination of the maze to find a correct path, the analysis should focus on identifying a move that offers the potential to move closer to the goal or set up a subsequent move that could lead directly to the goal. Given the constraints and the layout, a move that could potentially set up a path around the blocking wall or directly to the goal, if such a move exists, would be the best choice.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze had empty spaces at (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2), which formed a diagonal or a zigzag path from the player's position to the goal.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces
Given the layout of the empty spaces, the general shape can be described as a "zigzag" or "diagonal" path.

## Step 3: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same shape
To create a new maze, we need to ensure it has the same size (5x5) and includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces. The path should form a zigzag or diagonal shape.

## Step 4: Define the new maze's walls and empty spaces
Let's create a new maze where the empty spaces form a zigzag path. We can place the empty spaces at (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3), and (4, 4) to create a zigzag path from the top-left to the bottom-right of the maze.

## Step 5: Define the player's position and goal
The player's position (P) can be at (1, 1), and the goal (G) can be at (4, 4).

## Step 6: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 4)

The final answer is: 
(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "zigzag" or "diagonal" path.
(2) The new maze is encoded above.
