You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 2), and the goal is to reach position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (2, 2), we need to identify which of the adjacent positions (including diagonals) are empty and thus valid for the next move. The possible moves are constrained by the need to avoid walls.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the goal is at (4, 4) and the layout of the maze, the best strategy is to move in a direction that gets us closer to the goal while avoiding walls. Since the player is at (2, 2) and there's an empty space at (3, 3), moving diagonally to (3, 3) would be the most direct path towards the goal without hitting a wall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (3, 3), which was previously an empty space. The space at (2, 2) is now empty.

## Step 2: Identify new possible moves
Given the player's new position (3, 3), we need to look at the adjacent positions again to find a valid move towards the goal. The goal remains at (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze the best direction to move
Since the goal is to the right and down from the current position, and considering the constraints of the maze, the most direct path would involve moving either right, down, or diagonally down-right if possible.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
However, looking at the empty spaces, there's no direct diagonal or rightward move available. The only viable option to get closer to the goal is to move down to an empty space that would allow further progress towards the goal. Given the empty spaces available, moving to (4, 2) is the closest we can get to the goal without hitting a wall, setting up for a potential next move closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the new position
The player is now at (4, 2), closer to the goal but still needing to navigate around the walls to reach (4, 4).

## Step 2: Evaluate possible moves
Given the player's position at (4, 2), we look for adjacent empty spaces or a path that could lead closer to the goal. Since the goal is directly to the right, we need to find a way to move in that direction without hitting a wall.

## Step 3: Identify a viable path
Noticing the wall at (4, 3) blocks the direct path to the goal, we must find an alternative route. The empty space at (3, 3) suggests a possible path: moving diagonally up-right to (3, 3) could set up a future move closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Given the layout and the goal's position, moving diagonally up-right to (3, 3) is the best option. This move avoids walls and positions the player for a potential next move closer to the goal, possibly leveraging the empty space at (2, 4) or creating a new opportunity.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze form a diagonal path from the top-right to the bottom-left of the maze, but with the given positions, it's more accurate to describe it as a "staircase" or "zigzag" pattern because of the way the player must move to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and a path that forms the same general shape
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it's the same size (5x5), includes a valid path from P to G, and the path forms a similar "staircase" or "zigzag" pattern.

## Step 3: Define the new maze's walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal
Given the constraints and the need to form a similar shape with the empty spaces, we can define the new maze as follows:

- Walls will be placed to block direct paths and ensure the staircase pattern is maintained.
- Empty spaces will form a zigzag or staircase pattern from the player's position to the goal.
- The player's position and the goal will be placed at the start and end of the staircase pattern, respectively.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Here is the new maze encoded in the same format as the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

The final answer is: 
There is no numerical answer for this problem as it asks for a description and a new maze, which are provided above.
