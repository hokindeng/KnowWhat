You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 2), and the goal is to reach position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (2, 2), we need to find an adjacent empty space to move to. The possible moves are constrained by the maze's layout and the presence of walls and empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the goal position (4, 4) and the layout of the maze, the best strategy is to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. Since the player is at (2, 2) and there is an empty space at (3, 3), moving diagonally to (3, 3) would be the most direct move towards the goal while avoiding walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the previous move
The maze layout has changed with the player's new position at (3, 3), and the previous position (2, 2) is now an empty space.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and goal
The player is currently at position (3, 3), and the goal remains at position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (3, 3), we need to find an adjacent empty space to move to. The possible moves are constrained by the maze's layout and the presence of walls and empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the goal position (4, 4) and the layout of the maze, the best strategy is to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. Since the player is at (3, 3) and there is an empty space at (4, 2), moving to (4, 2) would not be the most direct move towards the goal. However, considering the available empty spaces, moving to (2, 4) is not an option as it moves away from the goal, and moving to (2, 2) also does not advance towards the goal. The most viable option is to move to (4, 2) and then reassess for a path to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the previous move
The maze layout has changed with the player's new position at (4, 2), and the previous position (3, 3) is now an empty space.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and goal
The player is currently at position (4, 2), and the goal remains at position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (4, 2), we need to find an adjacent empty space to move to. The possible moves are constrained by the maze's layout and the presence of walls and empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the goal position (4, 4) and the layout of the maze, the best strategy is to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. Since the player is at (4, 2) and the goal is at (4, 4), moving directly to the goal is blocked by a wall at (4, 3). However, there is an empty space at (3, 3) that could potentially lead to a path around the wall. But, a more direct approach would be to notice that the wall does not block movement to the goal if we consider diagonal movement is not possible due to the wall's placement but moving right is the correct direction. However, given the constraints, moving diagonally to the goal is not possible due to the wall, so we must move to an empty space that gets us closer or sets up a path around the wall. Since (3, 3) is the closest empty space that could lead to a path, we should move there.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the previous move
The maze layout has changed with the player's new position at (3, 3), and the previous position (4, 2) is now an empty space.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and goal
The player is currently at position (3, 3), and the goal remains at position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (3, 3), we need to find an adjacent empty space to move to. The possible moves are constrained by the maze's layout and the presence of walls and empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the goal position (4, 4) and the layout of the maze, the best strategy is to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. Since the player is at (3, 3) and the goal is at (4, 4), moving directly right is blocked by a wall at (4, 3), but moving diagonally up and right to (4, 4) is not possible in this step due to the wall. However, moving diagonally down and right is also not possible due to the wall's placement. The closest empty space that could lead to a path is (2, 4), but moving there does not advance us towards the goal directly. Since we've already been at (4, 2) and moving back does not advance us, we must consider other empty spaces. However, given the constraints, the most viable option is to move to (2, 4) and reassess for a path.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout after the previous move

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and goal
The player is currently at position (2, 4), and the goal remains at position (4, 4).

## Step 3: Analyze possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position (2, 4), we need to find an adjacent empty space to move to. The possible moves are constrained by the maze's layout and the presence of walls and empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the goal position (4, 4) and the layout of the maze, the best strategy is to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. Since the player is at (2, 4) and the goal is at (4, 4), moving directly right is not blocked by walls in the direction of the goal but there are no empty spaces directly to the right. However, moving down to (3, 4) is blocked by a wall, and moving diagonally to (3, 3) is the most viable option as it gets closer to the goal and avoids walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Considering the goal position (4, 4) and the layout of the maze, the best strategy is to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. Since the player is at (3, 3) and the goal is at (4, 4), moving directly right and down is the most direct path, but it is blocked by a wall at (4, 3). However, moving to (4, 2) is the closest we can get to the goal without being blocked by a wall and sets up a potential path around the wall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  2\right)}$

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the goal position (4, 4) and the layout of the maze, the best strategy is to move towards the goal while avoiding walls.

Since the player is at (3, 3) and the goal is at (4, 4), moving directly right and down is the most direct path, but it is blocked by a wall at (4, 3). However, moving to (4, 2) does not advance us towards the goal as we've already been there. Given the constraints, the most viable option is to move to (2, 4) but that also does not advance us towards the goal directly. However, since we can't move directly to the goal due to the wall, we can try moving to (2, 4) and reassess for a path.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a zigzag or a staircase, but given the constraints and the movement allowed (up, down, left, right, and diagonals), it's more accurate to describe it as a disconnected or broken diagonal line with some adjacent spaces allowing for movement around the walls.

## Step 2: Determine the name of the general shape
Given the description, the general shape can be considered a "Broken Diagonal".

## Step 3: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same shape
To create a new maze, we need to ensure it's the same size (5x5) and has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces. The maze should not be an identical copy of the original, but the empty spaces should form a "Broken Diagonal" shape.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Here is a new maze encoded in the same format as the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 4)

The final answer is: 
For (1), the general shape is a "Broken Diagonal".
For (2), the new maze is provided above.
