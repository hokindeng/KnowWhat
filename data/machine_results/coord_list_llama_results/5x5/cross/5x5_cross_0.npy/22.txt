You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will analyze the given information and plan a step-by-step path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Given the current player position is (2, 2) and the goal is (4, 4), and considering the positions of the walls and empty spaces, my next move would be to an adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal.

The closest empty space to the player position (2, 2) that is also closer to the goal (4, 4) is (2, 4). However, considering diagonal movements are allowed and looking for the most efficient path, moving directly towards the goal while avoiding walls is preferable.

Given the constraints and aiming for the shortest path, my next move would be to (3, 3), as it is diagonally adjacent, is an empty space, and brings me closer to the goal (4, 4).

Next move: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Considering the updated maze and the current player position (3, 3), the goal is still (4, 4). Since I am now closer to the goal but still need to navigate around the walls, my next move should bring me even closer to the goal while avoiding obstacles.

Given the available empty spaces, moving directly to the goal is not possible due to the wall at (3, 4). However, I can move to an adjacent empty space that would position me better for the next step towards the goal.

The most logical next move, aiming to get closer to the goal, would be to (4, 2), as it is an empty space and positions me closer to the goal, albeit not directly adjacent to it. However, considering the goal is to move towards (4, 4) and there's a direct path after this move, it's the best option.

Next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the current player position (4, 2), the goal (4, 4) is now within reach. Since I am on the same row as the goal and there are no walls between my current position and the goal, I can move directly towards it.

However, I notice there is a wall at (4, 3), which means I cannot move directly to the goal in a straight line along the row. But since diagonal movements are allowed, I can bypass this wall by moving diagonally to the goal.

Next move: (4, 4)

This move should bring me directly to the goal, solving the maze.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "staircase" or more specifically, a diagonal staircase.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar diagonal staircase shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form a diagonal staircase shape, similar to the original maze.
