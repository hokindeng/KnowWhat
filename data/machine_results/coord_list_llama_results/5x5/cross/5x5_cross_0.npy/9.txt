You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will analyze the given information and plan a step-by-step path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G).

First, let's visualize the maze:

```
Walls: 
(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)
(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)
(2, 0), (2, 1),          (2, 3)
(3, 0), (3, 1),          (3, 4)
(4, 0), (4, 1),          (4, 3)

Empty: 
                  (2, 4)
                  (3, 3)
                  (4, 2)

Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)
```

From the current player position (2, 2), I can move to the adjacent empty space (2, 4) or try to find another path. Since the goal is to reach (4, 4), I will prioritize moving towards the right and down.

My next move will be to (2, 4), as it is the closest empty space that brings me closer to the goal.

Next move: (2, 4)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "staircase" or a "zigzag" shape.

To create a new maze with the same shape, I will generate a new set of coordinates for the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position.

Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original and features a staircase-shaped path from the player position to the goal position. The empty spaces form a zigzag pattern, allowing the player to navigate through the maze and reach the goal.
