You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will analyze the given information and plan a step-by-step path from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Current player position: (2, 2)
Goal position: (4, 4)

Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), I will look for the closest empty space that brings me closer to the goal.

The closest empty space to the current player position (2, 2) is (2, 4), which is two steps to the right, but I can also consider moving diagonally to (3, 3) which is also an empty space and closer to the goal in terms of overall distance.

My next move will be to (3, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3, 3), I need to plan my next move to get closer to the goal (4, 4).

Since I'm currently at (3, 3), I can see that the goal is just one step to the right and one step down. However, there's a wall at (3, 4) that blocks my direct path to the goal.

I notice that there's an empty space at (4, 2), but moving there would take me away from the goal. Instead, I'll focus on getting closer to the goal by moving down to the same row as the goal.

My next move will be to (4, 3), but wait, there's a wall at (4, 3)! In that case, I'll move to the closest empty space that brings me closer to the goal. Since I'm already at (3, 3), I can move to (4, 2) and then try to find a way to the goal from there.

My next move will be to (4, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4, 2), I need to plan my next move to get closer to the goal (4, 4).

Since I'm already on the same row as the goal, I just need to move to the right to reach the goal. However, there's a wall at (4, 3) that blocks my direct path to the goal.

I notice that there's an empty space at (3, 3), which is diagonally up and to the right from my current position. I can move there and then try to find a way to the goal from that position.

However, I also notice that I can move diagonally up and to the right to (3, 3) and then I would be back to a previous position, or I can try to move directly to the goal (4, 4) by going around the wall at (4, 3). Since I'm on the same row as the goal, I can try to move directly to the goal.

My next move will be to (4, 4), the goal position.

Please let me know if I've successfully solved the maze!

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "staircase" or a "zigzag" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same staircase or zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form a staircase or zigzag shape, similar to the original maze.
