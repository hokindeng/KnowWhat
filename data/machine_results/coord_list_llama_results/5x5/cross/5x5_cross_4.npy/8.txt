You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the next step can only be the position immediately above the current position. However, this assumption is incorrect as it doesn't consider all possible adjacent empty spaces, including diagonals.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current player position
The current player position is given as (4, 0).

## Step 2: Identify the goal position
The goal position is given as (2, 0).

## Step 3: Determine the available adjacent empty spaces
From the current position (4, 0), we can see that the available adjacent empty spaces are (3, 1) and (4, 2), but the most promising one to move closer to the goal is (3, 1) since it's closer to the goal position.

## Step 4: Choose the best adjacent empty space to move to
The best next move is to position (3, 1) since it is the only available adjacent empty space that is also closer to the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position
The current player position is given as (3, 1).

## Step 2: Identify the goal position
The goal position is given as (2, 0).

## Step 3: Determine the available adjacent empty spaces
From the current position (3, 1), we can see that the available adjacent empty spaces are (2, 2) and (4, 2), but neither of these directly leads closer to the goal in a straight path. However, we can consider (2, 2) as a viable option since it's diagonally closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the best adjacent empty space to move to
Since we cannot move directly to the goal due to the wall at (2, 1), the best next move is to position (2, 2), which brings us closer to the goal and potentially sets up a path around the wall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position
The current player position is given as (2, 2).

## Step 2: Identify the goal position
The goal position is given as (2, 0).

## Step 3: Determine the available adjacent empty spaces
From the current position (2, 2), we can see that the only available adjacent empty space that leads closer to the goal is not directly accessible due to the wall at (2, 1). However, we can consider (3, 1) as a viable option to potentially find another path.

## Step 4: Choose the best adjacent empty space to move to
Since we cannot move directly to the goal due to the wall at (2, 1), the best next move is to position (3, 1), which may allow us to find an alternative route to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position
The current player position is given as (3, 1).

## Step 2: Identify the goal position
The goal position is given as (2, 0).

## Step 3: Determine the available adjacent empty spaces
From the current position (3, 1), we can see that the only available adjacent empty space that could potentially lead closer to the goal is (2, 2).

## Step 4: Choose the best adjacent empty space to move to
The best next move is to position (2, 2), which we previously occupied and is the closest empty space that could potentially lead to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position
The current player position is given as (2, 2).

## Step 2: Identify the goal position
The goal position is given as (2, 0).

## Step 3: Determine the available adjacent empty spaces
Unfortunately, from the current position (2, 2), there are no new available adjacent empty spaces that directly lead to the goal. The position (2, 1) is blocked by a wall.

## Step 4: Consider alternative paths or spaces
Since we cannot move directly to the goal due to the wall at (2, 1), and we've already explored the other paths, it seems we are stuck in an infinite loop between (2, 2) and (3, 1) due to the limited options provided by the maze's structure and the rules of movement.

## Step 5: Realize the limitation
Given the constraints and the rules of the maze, it appears that there is no viable path to the goal (2, 0) from the current position (2, 2) without breaking the rules or assuming additional empty spaces not provided.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
Upon reviewing the original maze, it appears that the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a diagonal line or a diagonal path with one extra space connected at the top. However, since we're looking for a general shape and considering the entire path from start to goal, the path itself doesn't strictly adhere to common geometric shapes like a straight line, a square, a circle, etc., due to its limited and specific nature. The closest description would be a "diagonal path" or simply a "path with a diagonal segment," but to fit it into a more recognizable geometric or general shape category is challenging due to its simplicity and uniqueness. For the sake of providing an answer, let's call it a "Modified Diagonal."

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape of empty spaces
Given the constraints and the requirement to mimic the "Modified Diagonal" shape within a new maze of the same size (5x5), we will create a maze that includes a path from a new starting point (P) to a new goal point (G), ensuring that the empty spaces form a similar diagonal-like path.

## Step 3: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original
Let's define the new maze:

- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4)
- Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)
- Player position (P): (1, 2)
- Goal (G): (3, 2)

However, upon re-evaluation, it seems the initial attempt to define a new maze with the same "Modified Diagonal" path characteristics was not fully successful in capturing the exact nature of the original path due to the oversimplification of the path's description. The task requires a path that not only adheres to the diagonal line more closely but also allows for a correct transition from the start to the goal, including diagonals.

Given this, the revised attempt to create a maze that more closely adheres to the original requirements while accurately capturing the diagonal essence would involve a more complex path that may not strictly follow the diagonal due to the limitations in the original maze's design and the movement rules. The original maze's unique structure and the specific rules governing movement make it challenging to replicate a path that is both diagonal and leads directly from a new start to a new goal without mirroring the original maze exactly.

Thus, the challenge in creating a new maze that meets all criteria while strictly adhering to the diagonal path becomes apparent, indicating a potential oversight in the initial analysis of the path's shape and the limitations it imposes on maze design within the given constraints.

The final answer is: 

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2)
Player position (P): (1, 2)
Goal (G): (3, 2)
