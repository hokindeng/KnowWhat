You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the next step can only be chosen from the given empty spaces and the goal position. However, in a maze-solving problem, we should consider all adjacent positions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) of the current player position, as long as they are not walls.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current player position and the goal position.
The current player position is given as (4, 0), and the goal position is given as (2, 0).

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current position.
From the current position (4, 0), we can potentially move in any of the eight directions: up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the feasible moves.
Since we can only move through empty spaces and we must avoid walls, we need to check which of the potential moves from step 2 are not walls and are either empty spaces or the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next step from the feasible moves.
Given the current player position is at the edge of the maze and considering the walls and empty spaces provided, we can logically infer potential moves by considering the nature of the maze. However, we can only accurately determine the best next step by analyzing the immediate surroundings of the current position, which are not explicitly detailed for all adjacent positions in the given problem statement.

## Step 5: Select the most logical move based on typical maze-solving strategies.
Since the direct path to the goal involves navigating through or around walls, the first logical step would generally involve moving into an empty space that brings us closer to the goal or sets us up for a future move that does so, taking into account the rules of movement (any of the eight directions).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\text{(3, 0)}}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Based on the coordinates of the empty spaces (2, 2), (3, 1), and (4, 2), it appears that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is an "L" shape, considering the player's starting position and the goal.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and a valid path from P to G.
The original maze has a size of 5x5. We need to create a new maze with the same size and a valid path from P to G that forms an "L" shape.

## Step 3: Determine the new coordinates for the empty spaces, player position, and goal.
To create a new maze, we need to choose different coordinates for the empty spaces, player position, and goal. Since the general shape should be an "L" shape, we can choose new coordinates that form this shape.

## Step 4: Define the new maze.
Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (1, 0) is a wall, so we choose (4, 2) as the new player position:
Player position: (4, 2)
However, since the coordinates for the player and goal given in the prompt do not form a valid maze, we must update them:
Goal: (2, 1) is a wall, so we choose (2, 4), however this too is a wall, an alternative is (3, 1).

However since we require the player position and goal position not to be a wall and to form a valid maze it is best we correct them to the following new settings.

Player position: (3,2)
Goal: (2,3)
But to keep the shape we designated we must give a new value to the player position that also keeps the path in "L" Shape which resembles the shape in part (1).
To meet this and also validate the requirement that it is not a wall let's try setting it to:
Player position: (2, 2)


The final answer is: $\boxed{\text{Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 2)}}$
