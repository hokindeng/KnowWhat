You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. 

First, let's analyze the maze:

Given the coordinates of walls, empty spaces, the current player position (P = 4, 0), and the goal (G = 2, 0), we can visualize the maze but for simplicity, we will treat it as a set of given points. My goal is to move from P to G without touching any walls, moving only through empty spaces.

From the player position at (4, 0), we can see there is an empty space at (4, 2) directly to the right and two spaces up from the current position, and another empty space at (3, 1) diagonally up to the left. However, there's no direct empty space leading towards our goal that doesn't involve moving through walls or going out of bounds. The direct path to the goal is obstructed by walls.

Since we are allowed to move in any diagonal direction as well as the cardinal directions, let's consider the options:

- To move towards the goal, we would ideally want to reduce the y-coordinate (move up) since our goal is at y=0.
- We can't move up from our current position because there's a wall.
- The closest y-coordinate reduction that's viable involves moving to an empty space that could eventually let us navigate up towards our goal.

Given the empty spaces, moving from (4, 0) to (3, 1) would be a viable move since it allows us to navigate closer to our goal by reducing the x-coordinate (moving left) and provides a more flexible position to potentially move up towards our goal. It's a tactical move that allows for potential future moves up towards our goal or towards other empty spaces that could lead to the goal.

Thus, the coordinates of my next move are (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (3, 1), the goal is to move towards (2, 0) while avoiding walls.

Considering the available empty spaces:

- Moving directly to the goal is not possible due to the wall at (3, 0) and the wall at (2, 1).
- There's an empty space at (2, 2) which is diagonally up and to the right from the current position.
- There's also an empty space at (4, 2) but moving there would increase the distance from the goal.

Given the constraints and the objective to move towards the goal, the best option is to move to the empty space at (2, 2). This move gets us closer to the x-coordinate of the goal (reduces x-coordinate) and provides a potential future path to navigate down towards our goal, depending on the available moves after this one.

Thus, the coordinates of my next move are (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at (2, 2), we have a relatively straightforward path towards the goal at (2, 0).

We notice that moving directly down from (2, 2) would put us at the goal (2, 0) if it weren't for the restrictions on movement through walls or out of bounds. However, there is no wall directly below us at (2, 1) that blocks a move down to the goal in terms of maze constraints.

Since the goal is directly below the current position, the best option is to try and move down to (2, 1) to get closer to the goal and then assess the next move, but unfortunately (2, 1) is not empty. However since (2, 1) isn't empty does not affect the case since we can reach the goal from the current location.

But considering the positions we can go to, none of the empty space positions make us closer to (2,0), in fact, they either maintain the same distance or actually get us further away. However we see (2,0) has an x coordinate of 2 the same as the current position (2, 2) hence being able to reach it directly if we move down in the direction of coordinates.


In a real game scenario we cannot just move into a non empty location so in that scenario more information would be needed for the final move(s), I'd be moving to the location that best helps my human instinct on puzzles like these and since it is just one step away in a typical puzzle like scenario we just need one more little piece of clear understanding of (2,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "Z" shape.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (1, 0)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar "Z" shape, and there is a valid path from the player position to the goal through the empty spaces. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it has the same size and shape characteristics.
