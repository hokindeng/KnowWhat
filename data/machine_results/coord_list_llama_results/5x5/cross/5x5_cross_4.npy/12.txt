You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. 

First, I need to analyze the current maze and available moves:

- Walls: I should avoid these.
- Empty: I can move to these. The closest one from the player's current position (4, 0) is (3, 1) and (4, 2).
- Since diagonal moves are allowed, I can consider (3, 1) for my next move as it's adjacent to (4, 0).

My next move would be to (3, 1). 

Please update the maze with this new position and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 1), I'll consider the available empty spaces.

Since (2, 0) is the goal, but it's not directly reachable because of the wall at (3, 0) and (2, 1), I'll move to a space that brings me closer to the goal or allows for a future move towards the goal.

Given the empty spaces, my best move is to (2, 2), as it's closer to the goal and allows for potential future moves towards (2, 0).

My next move would be to (2, 2).

Please update the maze with this new position and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 2), I can see that the goal (2, 0) is within reach, but I still need to navigate around the wall at (2, 1).

However, since I'm allowed to move diagonally, I can attempt to reach the goal directly.

My next move would be to (2, 0), moving diagonally around the wall at (2, 1) and (3, 0) or alternatively aiming for a spot adjacent to the goal if a diagonal path is considered invalid.

If this is not possible due to the constraints of the game, I would consider a different path. But based on the given rules, this move should be allowed.

Please update the maze with this new position and let me know the outcome.

(I am aware that if this move is not possible, my alternative path would likely involve backtracking and exploring other options, but given the rules provided, this seems like the most direct and logical next step.)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a zigzag.

(2) Here is a new maze with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)  // corrected, to be similar to the original P
 -> Player position: (0, 2) 
Goal: (4, 4) -> (2, 4) // setting as goal results to no direct goal path so changed -> goal corrected 
Goal: (2,0) -> to reflect start with value Answer revised:
