You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. Based on the current maze configuration:

1. Since I am at the player position (4,0), I will examine my adjacent empty spaces. Given I can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally, my only valid options for movement are limited by the positions listed as empty spaces. Given my position, the closest empty space is (4, 2), as moving directly up or diagonally towards the goal would not be possible due to the presence of walls.

My first move would be to move to the empty space (4, 2).

After this move, I'll reassess the maze for the next possible step, considering my new position will be (4, 2). 

However, since you requested only the first step and not the full path to the goal in this prompt, I'll conclude here for the initial response.

Next move: (4, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze appears to be a zigzag or a modified "Z" shape, given the limited number of empty spaces and their positioning. For simplicity, let's refer to it as a "zigzag" pathway.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size, with the empty spaces forming a similar zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position (P): (0, 4)
Goal (G): (0, 0)

This new maze meets the criteria: it's the same size as the original, includes a valid zigzag-shaped path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a zigzag or "Z"-like pathway.
