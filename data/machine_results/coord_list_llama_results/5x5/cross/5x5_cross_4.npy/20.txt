You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move.

From my current position (4, 0), I can move to any adjacent empty space. Since I can move in eight directions (up, down, left, right, and four diagonals), I'll consider the possible moves:

Up: (3, 0) is a wall, so this move is not possible.
Down: (5, 0) is outside the maze, so this move is not possible.
Left: (4, -1) is outside the maze, so this move is not possible.
Right: (4, 1) is a wall, so this move is not possible.
Diagonal up-left: (3, -1) is outside the maze, so this move is not possible.
Diagonal up-right: (3, 1) is an empty space!
Diagonal down-left: (5, -1) is outside the maze, so this move is not possible.
Diagonal down-right: (5, 1) is outside the maze, so this move is not possible.

Based on the possibilities, my next move will be to (3, 1).

My next position will be (3, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

My new position: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (3, 1), I'll evaluate the possible moves:

Up: (2, 1) is a wall, so this move is not possible.
Down: (4, 1) is a wall, so this move is not possible.
Left: (2, 1) and then to (2, 0) looks interesting, but (2, 1) is a wall, so I'll need to find an alternative route. (3, 0) is a wall, so moving directly left is not possible.
Right: (3, 2) is a wall, so this move is not possible.
Diagonal up-left: (2, 0) is the goal, but it's blocked by the wall at (2, 1). 
Diagonal up-right: (2, 2) is an empty space!
Diagonal down-left: (4, 0) is an empty space!
Diagonal down-right: (4, 2) is an empty space, but it doesn't bring me closer to the goal.

Since I want to move closer to the goal, I'll choose the diagonal up-right move, which will allow me to continue searching for a path to the goal.

My next position will be (2, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting closer to the goal.

From my current position (2, 2), I'll evaluate the possible moves:

Up: Not directly, since (2, 1) is a wall. However, I might be able to find an alternative route.
Down: (3, 2) is a wall, so this move is not possible.
Left: (2, 1) is a wall, so moving directly left is not possible.
Right: (2, 3) is a wall, so this move is not possible.
Diagonal up-left: Still blocked by the wall at (2, 1).
Diagonal up-right: Not possible, as (1, 3) and (1, 2) are walls and there is no empty space to move.
Diagonal down-left: (3, 1) is an empty space!
Diagonal down-right: Not possible, as (3, 3) is a wall and there is no empty space to move.

My next move will be to (3, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

My new position: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems I've been here before.

From my current position (3, 1), I'll re-evaluate the possible moves:

Since I was here before, I already know that moving up, down, left, and right is not possible. The diagonal moves also have the same results. However, I can try the other diagonal move that I didn't choose previously.

Diagonal up-right: (2, 2) is an empty space!

My next move will be to (2, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

My new position: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (2, 2) again.

Upon re-examining the maze, I notice that the only way to get closer to the goal (2, 0) is to go around the wall at (2, 1). Since I've tried all other directions and found no alternative, I will backtrack to (3, 1) and then try to move to (4, 0), hoping to find a path to the goal.

My next move will be to (3, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

My new position: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at (3, 1), my next move will be to (4, 0). This will allow me to move around the wall at (3, 0) and potentially find a path to the goal.

My next position will be (4, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

My new position: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (4, 0), I'll move to (3, 1) to continue trying to find a path around the walls to the goal.

However, I notice that I can also try to move diagonally to (3, 1) is one option but alternatively I can also try moving to a different empty space. Moving to (4, 2) might allow me to continue navigating around the maze.

My next position will be (4, 2) but then again I will see no clear next viable move if I go here but my next position will indeed be (4, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.



 My new position: (4, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, a valid path from P to G, and the same L-shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors):

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 4)

Note that this new maze has the same L-shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors), but it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The player position and goal position have also changed.
