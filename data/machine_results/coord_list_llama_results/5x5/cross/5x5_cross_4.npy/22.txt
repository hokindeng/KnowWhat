You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the next best move should be an empty space that is closer to the goal and is not blocked by a wall. However, the solution incorrectly chooses a space that is diagonally adjacent to the player position, but it also chooses a space that does not provide the shortest path to the goal. In a maze-solving problem, the goal is to find the shortest path to the goal while avoiding walls.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
First, visualize the maze by plotting the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position on a grid.

## Step 2: Determine possible moves
From the player's current position (4, 0), check all adjacent positions (including diagonals) to see which ones are empty spaces and not blocked by walls.

## Step 3: Calculate distances to the goal
For each possible move identified in step 2, calculate the distance to the goal (2, 0) to determine which move would bring the player closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the possible moves and their distances to the goal, choose the move that is not blocked by a wall and brings the player closer to the goal, also taking into account the overall shortest path to the goal. Since there are no empty spaces adjacent to the player position, we need to analyze the maze layout to find the shortest path.

## Step 5: Identify the shortest path
Analyzing the maze layout, we can see that the shortest path to the goal is to move the player up to (3, 0), then up to (2, 0). However, (3, 0) is blocked by a wall. We need to find an alternative path.

## Step 6: Choose the alternative path
A possible alternative path is to move the player right to (4, 1), but (4, 1) is blocked by a wall. Another alternative path is to move the player right to (4, 2), which is an empty space.

## Step 7: Select the next move
Since moving up is not an option and moving right to (4, 1) is blocked, the next best move is to move right to (4, 2), which is an empty space and provides a possible path to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original solution correctly solves the maze problem, and there is no step that can be considered incorrect for this new task.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the shape formed by the empty spaces
Looking at the original maze, we can observe that the empty spaces (corridors) form a general "Z" shape.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze that meets the given criteria, we need to rearrange the empty spaces and walls while maintaining the same overall "Z" shape.

## Step 3: Rearrange the maze elements
Rearrange the empty spaces to form a new "Z" shape. One possible arrangement is to place the empty spaces at (1, 1), (2, 2), and (3, 3).

## Step 4: Add the player and goal positions
Place the player position at (0, 0) and the goal position at (4, 4) to ensure a valid path exists.

## Step 5: Finalize the new maze
Encode the new maze using the same format as the original.

## Step 6: Output the new maze
Output the new maze.


The final answer for part 1 is: The general shape formed by the empty spaces is "Z".

The final answer for part 2 is: 

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 4)
