You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the next step can only be determined by excluding the positions that lead to an immediate dead end. However, this approach is incorrect as it does not guarantee a path to the goal. A more systematic approach, such as backtracking or a breadth-first search (BFS), should be used to ensure that all possible paths are explored.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the problem and the maze layout.
We have a 2D maze with specific coordinates denoting walls, empty spaces, a player position, and a goal position. We need to navigate from the player position (4,0) to the goal position (2,0) without hitting any walls.

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves.
We can move in any of the eight directions: up, down, left, right, and four diagonals. However, we can only move to an empty space.

## Step 3: Find the adjacent empty spaces to the player position.
We start at (4,0). Looking at the maze layout, we see that the only adjacent empty space is (4,2) horizontally and no space vertically. Since the empty space is two steps away, we also consider (4,1), but it's a wall. So, we have a possible move to (4,2) in two steps, but we need an intermediate step. We should move to a position from which we can continue towards the goal.

## Step 4: Use BFS to find the shortest path.
Using BFS, we start from the player position and explore all possible moves level by level. The BFS algorithm will ensure that we find the shortest path to the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the BFS result.
After performing BFS, we find that the shortest path is to move diagonally up and to the right, or we test adjacent spaces and we cannot move directly to (2,0) which is the goal because there are walls in the way so we must try all possible moves. Among them, moving up is blocked by a wall. Thus, we can only move right from (4,0), trying to go around the wall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "Z" shape or a "zigzag" pattern.

Here is a new maze of the same size that meets the criteria:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

The new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces. The general shape formed by the empty spaces is also a "Z" shape or a "zigzag" pattern. The new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but rather a new instance of a maze with the same shape.
