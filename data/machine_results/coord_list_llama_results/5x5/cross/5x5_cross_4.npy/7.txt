You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. 

First, I need to analyze the current maze and available moves:

- Walls: I should avoid these.
- Empty: I can move to these. The closest one from the player's current position (4, 0) is (3, 1) and (4, 2).
- Since diagonal moves are allowed, I can consider (3, 1) for my next move as it's adjacent to (4, 0).

My next move would be to (3, 1). 

Please update the maze with this new position and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 1), I can examine the adjacent empty spaces:

- Empty: (2, 2) is the closest one, and since diagonal moves are allowed, I can consider it for my next move.

However, I also notice that (2, 2) is not directly adjacent to the goal (2, 0). If I move to (2, 2), I might be creating more distance between myself and the goal.

Given that there is no other adjacent empty space to move to that's closer to the goal, I'll move to (2, 2) in the hopes of finding a future path to the goal.

My next move would be to (2, 2).

Please update the maze with this new position and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 2), I see that the goal (2, 0) is very close, but I have to navigate around the wall at (2, 1). 

Since I'm currently at (2, 2), I don't have any immediately adjacent empty spaces to move to. However, I can try moving back to (3, 1), which I previously occupied, and see if I can find an alternative route to the goal from there.

My next move would be to (3, 1).

Please update the maze with this new position and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at (3, 1), I need to find a new path to the goal (2, 0).

Unfortunately, I don't have a direct path to the goal due to the wall at (3, 0) and (2, 1). The closest empty space to the goal that I can move to is not directly accessible.

However, I can try moving to (4, 0), which is an empty space. From there, I can reassess the maze and look for a new opportunity to reach the goal.

My next move would be to (4, 0).

Please update the maze with this new position and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 0), I've reached a point where I can potentially move back towards the goal.

I'll examine the adjacent empty spaces:

- Empty: (3, 1) is adjacent and has been visited before, but it's a viable option to re-explore.

Since diagonal moves are allowed, I can move back to (3, 1) and reassess the maze from there. Perhaps I can find a new path to the goal (2, 0) that wasn't apparent before.

My next move would be to (3, 1).

Please update the maze with this new position and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at (3, 1), I'll re-examine the maze:

- Walls: Blocking my direct path to the goal (2, 0) are the walls at (3, 0) and (2, 1).
- Empty: (2, 2) is a possibility, but I've been there before and couldn't find a path to the goal from there.

Since I'm stuck, I'll try to explore other empty spaces and potentially find a new path. 

I notice (4, 2) is an adjacent empty space that I haven't visited recently. Moving there might give me a new perspective on the maze.

My next move would be to (4, 2).

Please update the maze with this new position and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 2), I can see the maze from a different angle:

- Walls: Still blocking my path to the goal (2, 0) are the walls at (3, 0) and (2, 1).
- Empty: I see (3, 1) and (2, 2) as potential moves, but I've been to those spaces before and couldn't find a path to the goal from there.
- The goal (2, 0) seems out of reach from here.

However, I can try to move to (3, 1) again, hoping to find a new path or revisit old paths to see if I missed something.

My next move would be to (3, 1).

Please update the maze with this new position and let me know the outcome.

(Note: If I get stuck in a loop, please let me know, and I can try a different approach or reset the maze.)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at (3, 1), I realize I've been stuck in a loop and revisiting the same spaces multiple times. It's time to rethink my approach.

Upon re-examining the maze, I notice that I've been focusing on the upper-right part of the maze, trying to find a path to the goal (2, 0). However, I might have missed something.

Let me try to approach the goal from a different angle. Since the goal is at (2, 0), I should focus on getting closer to the left edge of the maze.

My next move would be to (4, 0), which is an empty space closer to the left edge.

Please update the maze with this new position and let me know the outcome.

(Note: If I get stuck again, I might need to reset the maze or try a different approach.)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 0), I can see that I'm still quite far from the goal (2, 0), and the wall at (3, 0) is blocking my direct path.

Since I've already explored the upper-right part of the maze, my next move would be to move to a space that might give me a better chance of finding a path to the goal.

Unfortunately, the only adjacent empty space is (3, 1), which I've visited multiple times before.

However, I notice that the wall at (3, 0) might be the key to finding a path to the goal. If I can find a way to get past or around that wall, I might be able to reach the goal.

My next move would be to think about the maze structure and try to find a pattern or a weakness in the wall layout.

Since I've been stuck in a loop before, I'll take a risk and make a bold move.

I'll move to (3, 1) and reassess the maze from there.

Please update the maze with this new position and let me know the outcome.

(Note: If I get stuck again, I might need to reset the maze or try a different approach.)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (3, 1) again. Given the current state of the maze, I don't have any new options or insights.

It seems I've exhaustively explored the maze and cannot find a path to the goal (2, 0) from my current position.

My next move would be to acknowledge that I'm stuck and request assistance or guidance.

Can you please provide a hint or clarify if there's a solution to this maze? Alternatively, if the maze is unsolvable, please let me know so I can restart or move on to a new challenge.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "Inverted L" shape or an "L" shape, with the long arm pointing towards the bottom of the maze and the short arm pointing towards the left side.

However, closer inspection reveals that the corridors could be seen as forming a zig-zag shape or a broken diagonal line, but since I got stuck, I'll go with the "Broken diagonal line".

(2) Here is a new maze that meets the specified criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please note that the new maze has the same size as the original (5x5), and its corridors form a broken diagonal line shape. The player can navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal. The new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze.
