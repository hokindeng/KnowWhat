You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the next best move should be diagonal to decrease the distance in both axes equally. However, this does not take into account the restrictions imposed by the presence of walls and the availability of empty spaces. A more accurate approach should consider the actual layout of the maze and the possible moves from the current player position.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current player position and the goal position.
The player position is (4, 0), and the goal is (2, 0).

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current player position.
The player can move up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. We need to check which of these moves are valid by examining the empty spaces.

## Step 3: Examine the maze layout to find valid moves.
From the current player position (4, 0), we need to move towards the goal. The most direct approach is to move up and left. However, we can see that there are walls blocking the way if we try to move diagonally or directly left. Thus, the first move should be up if possible or right if necessary.

## Step 4: Choose the next move.
Given the restrictions on moving up and left, the best approach is to move right since moving directly up is blocked by the wall at (3, 0). So, we need to find a way around the maze by navigating the empty spaces.


## Step 5: Select the most appropriate move based on the analysis.
After analyzing the maze, we see that moving diagonally up-right is not possible because there's a wall at (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), and other positions blocking the direct path up. Thus, we first need to find a viable path towards the goal. Considering the widely available walls in the path, and the available steps to be either via going up-right diagonally from (4,0), which leads us towards (3, 1) or right from (4, 0) which is (4, 1) if this move will push us into a wall.


## Step 6: Analyze possible moves further.
Moving directly to (3, 1) or (4, 1) would not be wise from (4,0) since there is either another wall or a wall along the appropriate transports on both of those paths. For next, you can choose which step diagonal movement is optimally recommended from (4,0). Based on provided value one more ahead albeit contradictably header walls blocking these runners,(3, 1) ain't encoded unavailable meeting furter.


## Step 7: Conclusion.
However, since diagonal movement is more advantageous, (3, 1) could become right point according expression based viable square movement possible bring effort into decreasing axial length encoding goes on euclidean movement downwards continuing denote succinct move containing afforded adj ( udef `\ ' ), current particles directly weigh downwards


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original solution approach should still apply, but now we're closer to the goal and have a clearer path.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current player position and the goal position.
The player position is (3, 1), and the goal is (2, 0).

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current player position.
The player can move up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. We need to check which of these moves are valid by examining the empty spaces.

## Step 3: Examine the maze layout to find valid moves.
From the current player position (3, 1), we need to move towards the goal. The most direct approach is to move up and left to get closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move.
Given the current position and the goal, moving diagonally up-left is not possible due to a wall at (2, 1). The next best move is to move directly up to (2, 1), but that is also blocked. Thus, we should try to move left or right to an open space.

## Step 5: Select the most appropriate move based on the analysis.
After analyzing the maze, we see that moving left from (3, 1) will result in hitting the wall at (3, 0). Thus, we need to move to an empty space that can bring us closer to the goal.


## Step 6: Find the closest empty space that can lead to the goal.
Since we cannot move left or directly up, the next best move is to find an empty space that might allow a better path. However, considering our analysis, a better approach would be to move up if possible or find a diagonal move that does not block our future movements.


## Step 7: Look for the optimal path to minimize steps necessary to get closer to (2,0).
Note moving diagonally occasionally upward movement usually progress decrease transport movement down hopefully ending competition and reaches least preferred overhead cost since bump preference note explained until wall noted left right Further dropped removed rule freedom movement decreases tendencies freeing warns dropped specials trailed legislation emphasizing pop elastic belts.


## Step 8: Conclusion.
The optimal move, for now, would be (2, 2). So we can move diagonally up-right.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original solution approach is still applicable.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current player position and the goal position.
The player position is (2, 2), and the goal is (2, 0).

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current player position.
The player can move up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. We need to check which of these moves are valid by examining the empty spaces.

## Step 3: Examine the maze layout to find valid moves.
From the current player position (2, 2), we need to move towards the goal. The most direct approach is to move left.

## Step 4: Choose the next move.
Given the current position and the goal, moving left is the most direct path.

## Step 5: Check for any blocking walls.
Since we are moving left from (2, 2) to reach the goal (2, 0), we should check if there are any blocking walls. There is a wall at (2, 1) but not between (2, 2) and (2, 1).


## Step 6: Execute the chosen move.
We can move to (2, 1) and then determine the next step from there.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  1\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "Z-shape" or a "Staircase shape".


Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same Z-shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (1, 1)


This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces, forming the same Z-shape. It is not an identical copy of the original maze.
