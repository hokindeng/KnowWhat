You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the next best move should be an empty space that is closer to the goal and is not blocked by a wall. However, the solution incorrectly chooses a space that is diagonally adjacent to the player position, but it also chooses a space that does not provide the shortest path to the goal. In a maze-solving problem, the goal is to find the shortest path to the goal while avoiding walls.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
First, visualize the maze by plotting the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position on a grid.

## Step 2: Determine possible moves
From the player's current position (4, 0), check all adjacent positions (including diagonals) to see which ones are empty spaces and not blocked by walls.

## Step 3: Calculate distances to the goal
For each possible move identified in step 2, calculate the distance to the goal (2, 0) to determine which move would bring the player closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the possible moves and their distances to the goal, choose the move that is not blocked by a wall and brings the player closer to the goal, also taking into account the overall shortest path to the goal. Since there are no empty spaces adjacent to the player position, we need to analyze the maze layout to find the shortest path.

## Step 5: Identify the shortest path
Analyzing the maze layout, we can see that the shortest path to the goal is to move the player up to (3, 0), then up to (2, 0). However, (3, 0) is blocked by a wall. We need to find an alternative path.

## Step 6: Choose the alternative path
A possible alternative path is to move the player right to (4, 1), but (4, 1) is blocked by a wall. Another alternative path is to move the player right to (4, 2), which is an empty space.

## Step 7: Select the next move
Since moving up is not an option and moving right to (4, 1) is blocked, the next best move is to move right to (4, 2), which is an empty space and provides a possible path to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original solution correctly solves the maze problem, but it doesn't address the two new requests: identifying the general shape formed by the empty spaces and generating a new maze with the same shape.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces
Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left. However, considering the player position and the goal position, the empty spaces form an "L" shape.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same shape
To generate a new maze with the same "L" shape, we need to create a new set of walls and empty spaces that form an "L" shape, while keeping the same size and providing a valid path from the player position to the goal position.

## Step 3: Create the new maze
Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 0), (4, 2), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

However, the above new maze has the player's starting position on a wall, which is not valid.


## Step 4: Revise the new maze
We need to revise the new maze to ensure that it has a valid path from the player position to the goal position.


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0), (4, 2), (4, 0)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)


However, this maze has the same empty spaces as the original one but with some changes in the wall positions.


## Step 5: Revise the new maze again
We need to revise the new maze again to ensure that it has a different configuration of empty spaces while maintaining the "L" shape.


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)


However, this maze has the player's starting position and goal which can't be reached through the "L" shaped path.


## Step 6: Revise the new maze again
We need to revise the new maze again to ensure that the player's starting position and goal can be reached through the "L" shaped path.


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)


However, this maze has a wall in (2,2) position which makes the empty space (2, 0) not reachable from the player's position.


## Step 7: Revise the new maze again
We need to revise the new maze again to ensure that the player can reach the goal.


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)


The final answer is:


The general shape formed by the empty spaces is an "L".

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)
