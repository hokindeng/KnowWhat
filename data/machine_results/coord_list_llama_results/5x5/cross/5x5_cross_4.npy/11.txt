You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will attempt to solve it.

From the player position (4, 0), my next move will be to the empty space (4, 2) since it's the only adjacent empty space. However, I will move to (3, 1) first, as it's a better strategic move to get closer to the goal.

My next move is to (3, 1).

Please update the maze and let me know the new state.

Note: I'll be using a breadth-first search approach to solve the maze, exploring all possible paths level by level to ensure the shortest path to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, my next move will be to the empty space (2, 2).

This move gets me closer to the goal (2, 0) while avoiding the walls.

My next move is to (2, 2).

Please update the maze again.

Note: The strategy remains the same, aiming for the shortest path to the goal using available empty spaces.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 2), I want to move closer to the goal (2, 0). However, I'm blocked by the wall at (2, 1).

In this case, I need to backtrack a bit to find an alternative route. I'll move to (3, 1) to explore other possibilities.

My next move is to (3, 1).

Please update the maze.

Note: This move is part of the backtracking strategy to find an alternative route to the goal. I may need to revisit some empty spaces to find the correct path.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (3, 1). I'll explore other possibilities to reach the goal. Since the goal (2, 0) is to the left and top of my current position, I'll try to move closer in that direction.

Unfortunately, I'm blocked by the wall at (3, 0). So, I'll move to the empty space (4, 0) to explore further possibilities.

My next move is to (4, 0).

Please update the maze.

Note: I'll continue to explore different paths until I find the correct one to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 0), I see that I'm still not closer to the goal (2, 0). Since I've explored the right and down directions, I'll move back up to explore other possibilities.

My next move is to (3, 1) again.

Please update the maze.

Note: This move is another backtracking step to explore alternative routes to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Back at (3, 1) again! This time, I'll try to move to (2, 2) to get closer to the goal (2, 0).

My next move is to (2, 2).

Please update the maze.

Note: I'm trying to find a way to reach the goal by moving closer to it, even if it's not a direct path.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (2, 2). The goal (2, 0) is close, but I'm blocked by the wall at (2, 1).

Unfortunately, I've explored all possible paths, and I couldn't find a way to reach the goal (2, 0) directly. Since the goal is blocked by a wall, I conclude that there is no possible path to the goal from the given maze configuration.

I'll admit that I couldn't find a solution to this maze.

Please confirm if I'm correct or provide further guidance if I've missed something.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "inverted L" shape or an "L" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze with empty spaces that form an "L" shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)


This maze is not identical to the original maze but forms the same "L" shape with the empty spaces. There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces.
