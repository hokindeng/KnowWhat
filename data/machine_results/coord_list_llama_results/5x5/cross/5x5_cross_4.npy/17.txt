You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. 

First, I need to analyze the current maze and available moves:

- Walls: I should avoid these.
- Empty: I can move to these. The closest one from the player's current position (4, 0) is (3, 1) and (4, 2).
- Since diagonal moves are allowed, I can consider (3, 1) for my next move as it's adjacent to (4, 0).

My next move would be to (3, 1). 

Please update the maze with this new position and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 1), I'll consider the available empty spaces.

- Since I've just come from (4, 0), moving back there might not be the best choice, unless necessary.
- (4, 2) is an option but doesn't seem to lead directly towards the goal (2, 0).
- The goal (2, 0) is above and slightly to the left of my current position. However, it's not directly reachable due to the wall at (3, 0) and other walls.
- (2, 2) seems like a promising choice because it's closer to the goal and might allow for more movement options in the next step.

Considering the diagonals and the goal's location, my next move would be to (2, 2).

Please update the maze with this new position and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), I can assess the situation:

- I've managed to get closer to the goal (2, 0).
- There is a wall directly below the goal at (3, 0) which blocks a straightforward path, and also a wall directly to the left of the goal isn't an issue since I am on the same x-coordinate as the goal.
- Given that I'm at (2, 2), and the goal is (2, 0), the direct path upwards seems viable.

Since I can move directly up towards the goal and there are no walls mentioned at (2, 1) is a wall, I'll need to reconsider my approach. Since (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), and (1, 4) are all walls and there is also a wall at (2, 1) that means I would need to go around them if I could. Given the current state of the board I will move right to (4, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze appears to be a broken or staggered "L" shape (considering the empty spaces at (2, 2), (3, 1), and (4, 2) as forming an "L"). However, considering the complexity of accurately describing shapes in text without visual aid, and given the path can also be considered a collection of segments with one being diagonal, it could be argued to form other shapes or simply a path with no specific geometric shape without more context.

(2) Since the path could be argued to resemble a form of "L" shape but with more complexity due to diagonal movement and staggered positions, creating a new maze that captures this essence while providing a valid path requires creativity. Here is a new maze of the same size, with the goal of maintaining a path that could be loosely described as an "L" shape but with a unique arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)

Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)

Player position: (4, 2)

Goal: (2, 0)

This maze maintains the size and complexity of the original while providing a unique path that captures the essence of a staggered or broken shape, necessitating diagonal and non-linear movement to solve it.
