You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move. 

To reach the goal position (2, 0) from the current player position (4, 0), I will move up and to the left. Since there's a wall directly above me, I will try to move diagonally up and to the left, or move left and then up. The nearest empty space to my left is (4, 2) and then I can try to move up from there.

The coordinates of my next move are (4, 1) -> no, there is a wall; so, I will move to the empty space: (4, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "inverted L" shape, more specifically a zigzag L, but roughly resembling an inverted L.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a similar inverted L shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 4) -> corrected position to put on the opposite end of the path from goal. Position (1,0) stays on an edge.
 (Updated start as described; to make clear) Position start: (1 , 1)  
Goal: (1, 0)


Corrected cells with that corridor avoiding obviously unsolvable path from (0,4):


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1,2) 
Goal: (1, 1)
