You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. Based on the current maze configuration:

Since my current position is (4, 0), my possible next moves are limited to empty spaces that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to my current position.

The closest empty spaces to my current position (4, 0) are (3, 1) and (4, 2). Since I am trying to reach the goal (2, 0) in as few steps as possible, moving diagonally to a position closer to the goal is preferred. However, the diagonal path to (3, 1) seems to be the most direct approach to get closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move will be to (3, 1).

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my current position at (3, 1) and considering the empty spaces available, I'm looking to move closer to the goal (2, 0).

Since there's a wall at (3, 0), my direct path down to the goal is blocked. However, I see an opportunity to move closer diagonally to the goal by going to the empty space at (2, 2).

From (2, 2), I might be able to find a way around the wall at (2, 1) and proceed towards the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 2), I'll try to move closer to the goal (2, 0).

Since the direct path to the goal is still blocked by the wall at (2, 1), I'll look for an alternative route. Given the available empty spaces, I can move back to (3, 1) or explore the possibility of moving to (4, 2), but neither of these moves seems to bring me closer to the goal directly.

However, I notice that the empty space at (3, 1) could allow me to move further down to (4, 0), which in turn might provide an opportunity to approach the goal from a different angle.

For now, I'll move back to (3, 1), as it presents more options for the next step.

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 1).

(Note: I'm aware that this move takes me away from the goal slightly, but it's a strategic move to set up a potential path forward.)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (3, 1). Considering my goal is to reach (2, 0) and my current position, I will now move to (4, 0).

This move allows me to position myself to potentially move up towards the goal, and from (4, 0), I might find an alternative route to reach (2, 0).

The coordinates of my next move are (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (4, 0). With my current position and the available empty spaces, I see that the most direct path towards the goal (2, 0) is blocked by the wall at (3, 0).

However, I can move diagonally to (3, 1), which gets me one step closer to the goal and also closer to the empty space at (2, 2). This move also sets me up for potential further moves that might lead to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (3, 1) again. It seems I've reached a familiar point in the maze. Given my current position and the available empty spaces, my next move will be to (2, 2).

This move gets me closer to the goal and allows me to re-evaluate the maze from a new position. Perhaps I can find an alternative route to the goal from (2, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (2, 2) again. At this point, I realize that the maze's configuration forces me to move away from the goal and then come back. Given my current position, I'll try a different approach.

I'll move to (3, 1) one more time, but this time I'll plan to move further to (4, 0) and then explore other options from there.

However, I notice that I've tried this route before. To break the cycle, I must think of an alternative. Considering the maze structure, I realize that I may have missed an opportunity.

Unfortunately, I don't see any other viable options from (2, 2). I'll make the familiar move to (3, 1) and try to re-evaluate.

Wait, there might be another way. The goal is at (2, 0), which is only two spaces away from my current position. If I can move up to (1, 2) or to (2, 1), that would put me right next to the goal.

But these spaces are blocked by walls. This might indicate that the maze is not solvable with the given configuration and rules.

Please confirm if the maze is indeed solvable or if I need to adapt my approach further.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "L-Shape" or "broken L-Shape" since it resembles a broken L shape with a vertical and horizontal segment connected at the middle.

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-Shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 2)

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and the general shape of its empty spaces forms a recognizable L-Shape.
