You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

Since my current player position is (4, 0) and my goal is (2, 0), I will move diagonally up and left to get closer to the goal. However, I need to ensure that I don't hit any walls. Looking at the empty spaces, I see that (3, 1) and (4, 2) are not in a straight line to the goal, but (3, 1) could be a possible stepping stone.

I will move to (3, 1) as my next step, as it is an adjacent empty space and might provide a path towards the goal.

Next move: (3, 1)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I'll plan my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've reached (3, 1) and the maze has been updated. Now, I will analyze my next step.

Since my current player position is (3, 1) and my goal is (2, 0), I want to move closer to the goal. However, the wall at (3, 0) blocks my direct path to the goal. I need to find an alternative route.

I notice that (2, 2) is an empty space and relatively close to the goal. I will move to (2, 2) as my next step, as it is an adjacent empty space and might provide a path towards the goal.

Next move: (2, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I'll plan my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've reached (2, 2) and the maze has been updated. Now, I will analyze my next step.

Since my current player position is (2, 2) and my goal is (2, 0), I'm very close to the goal, but the wall at (2, 1) blocks my direct path. However, I can move diagonally to the goal.

Next move: (2, 0)

I will attempt to move directly to the goal, as it is an adjacent position and within diagonal reach.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I'll determine if I've successfully reached the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)

This new maze has the same 5x5 size as the original maze, a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape, which was the same shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
