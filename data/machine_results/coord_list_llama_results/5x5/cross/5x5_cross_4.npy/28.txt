You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will attempt to solve it.

From the player position (4, 0), my next move will be to (3, 1). 

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will plan the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, my next move will be to (2, 2). 

However, this move won't bring me directly closer to the goal, but rather puts me in a better position for the next steps. 

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will plan the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting closer to the goal. 

From my current position (2, 2), my next move will be to (2, 0), but that's blocked by a wall at (2, 1), and there are no adjacent empty spaces that I can move to in a way that gets me directly closer to the goal. However, I can backtrack to (3, 1) which has the potential to help me find an alternative route to the goal in the long run.

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will plan the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (3, 1), my next move will be to (4, 0) in a attempt to explore possible routes on the right side of the maze that could eventually connect back to the left.

However, if I move to (4, 0) and try to find a path, the alternative path will be long, with moves where I move right then up and then move leftwards back towards the goal. But I will do so if needed, The next step in that case would simply be (4, 0).

The coordinates of my next move are (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (4, 0), I'll continue trying to find a route that would eventually get me back to the goal position. The next step would be moving to (4, 2) in order to keep exploring the right side of the maze for any potential connections to the left.

However, given that no direct connection to the left seems apparent after that move, my following moves would have to keep exploring alternative options, potentially going up and left if possible, after every new step. But for now I will make this current move. 

The coordinates of my next move are (4, 2).

Please update the maze, and I will plan the next step.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, a valid path from P to G, and an L-shaped corridor:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 2), (2, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 2)

Note that this new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and features an L-shaped corridor.
