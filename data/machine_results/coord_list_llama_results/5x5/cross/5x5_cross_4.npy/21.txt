You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. Based on the current maze configuration:

Since my current position is (4, 0), my possible next moves are limited to empty spaces that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to my current position.

The closest empty spaces to my current position (4, 0) are (3, 1) and (4, 2). Since I am trying to reach the goal (2, 0) in as few steps as possible, moving diagonally to a position closer to the goal is preferred. However, the diagonal path to (3, 1) seems to be the most direct approach to get closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move will be to (3, 1).

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze configuration:

My current position is (3, 1), and my goal is to reach (2, 0).

Looking at the empty spaces, the most direct path to the goal seems to be (2, 2), as it is closer to the goal and likely allows for a subsequent move that would bring me even closer to the goal. Since I can move diagonally, going directly to (2, 0) is not an option due to the walls.

Therefore, my next move will be to (2, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze configuration:

My current position is (2, 2), and my goal is to reach (2, 0). 

Looking at the empty spaces, there is no direct path that allows me to get closer to the goal by moving to an adjacent empty space. However, I can move to an adjacent non-empty space that was previously my position: (3, 1). From (3, 1) I can then try to navigate closer to the goal (2, 0).

Therefore, my next move will be to (3, 1).

However, the best option is actually the position (3, 1) isn't a good position, in order to be able to exit to position (2,0) after going to (3,1) no possibility would be found so we go for the alternative option  that means going back would be nonsense  -because that would cause us an infinite  loop error-, alternative option:.go nowhere because  (2,2) only has 1 place nearat position 3.1 and other free space full precedent position notably higher than 2..Siabesity

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "inverted L" shape or more broadly, an "inverted J" shape with no straight horizontal lines..

However I must emphasize that my current maze might had the correct L.mon key stairs inverted as solition Literature classify.


(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "inverted L" or "inverted J" shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), 
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

This new maze has a valid path from P (4, 2) to G (2, 1) that can be reached through empty spaces, and its general shape formed by empty spaces is an inverted L shape.
