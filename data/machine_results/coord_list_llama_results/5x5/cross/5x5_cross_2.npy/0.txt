You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the player can move in any diagonal direction or up, down, left, right. However, given the constraints of the maze and the positions provided, there's an incorrect assumption about the available moves. The player's best next move is not (2, 4) because that would be moving into a wall based on the provided maze layout. Instead, we should look for an empty space that is closer to the goal and is actually accessible.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal.
The player is currently at position (3, 4) and needs to reach the goal at position (1, 2).

## Step 2: Identify accessible empty spaces from the current position.
Considering the current position (3, 4), the accessible empty spaces are (2, 3) and (3, 2), as they are directly adjacent to the current position.

## Step 3: Determine the optimal next move.
To get closer to the goal (1, 2), moving directly towards it while avoiding walls is essential. Between (2, 3) and (3, 2), (2, 3) is closer to the goal in a free path without walls.

## Step 4: Choose the next step.
Based on the assessment, moving to (2, 3) is the optimal next step as it is an empty space adjacent to the player's current position and brings the player closer to the goal without hitting any walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None, but the correct next steps need to be determined based on the current maze state and goal.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal.
The player is currently at position (2, 3) and needs to reach the goal at position (1, 2).

## Step 2: Identify accessible empty spaces from the current position.
Considering the current position (2, 3), the directly accessible empty spaces that lead closer to the goal without hitting walls need to be identified. Given the walls and empty spaces, moving diagonally to (1, 4) is the only viable option that brings the player closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

## Step 3: Determine the optimal next move.
Given the constraints of the maze and the goal position, the optimal next move is to (1, 4) as it sets up for a potential move closer to the goal in subsequent steps without directly running into a wall.

## Step 4: Choose the next step.
Based on the assessment, moving to (1, 4) is the optimal next step as it utilizes the available empty space to potentially set up a closer move towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None, but the correct next steps need to be determined based on the current maze state and goal.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal.
The player is currently at position (1, 4) and needs to reach the goal at position (1, 2).

## Step 2: Identify accessible empty spaces from the current position.
Considering the current position (1, 4), and given the need to get closer to the goal (1, 2), directly moving towards the goal along the same x-coordinate is ideal. However, there's a wall at (1, 3) blocking the direct path.

## Step 3: Determine the optimal next move.
Given the wall at (1, 3) blocks the direct path, the player must consider alternative moves that will eventually lead closer to the goal without hitting walls. Moving to an empty space that offers a path around the wall or closer to the goal is essential.

## Step 4: Choose the next step.
Since the goal is at (1, 2) and there's a wall at (1, 3), moving diagonally or sideways to avoid the wall while getting closer to the goal is necessary. Given the available empty spaces, a diagonal move is not directly possible to an empty space, so re-evaluating direct accessibility to the goal is necessary.

Given the only viable option and the maze layout, considering a correction in understanding available moves:

A closer inspection reveals that given the maze's constraints and the goal's position relative to the player, a direct move towards the goal along the y-axis is blocked by a wall, but considering the last known position of empty spaces, there was a mistake in identifying accessible empty spaces for direct movement towards the goal.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None, but the correct assessment of the shape and generation of a new maze are required.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Given the original maze's empty spaces at (1, 4), (2, 3), and (3, 2), and considering their positioning relative to each other, they form a diagonal line or a staircase pattern from the top right to the bottom left of the maze. Thus, the general shape can be described as a "staircase" or "diagonal line".

## Step 2: Generate a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same shape.
The new maze should have the same dimensions (5x5) and a staircase or diagonal line shape formed by the empty spaces. However, the positions of the empty spaces and walls should differ from the original maze.

## Step 3: Determine the positions of the empty spaces for the new maze.
To maintain the staircase or diagonal line shape, the new empty spaces could be placed at positions that form a diagonal line from top left to bottom right or any other configuration that maintains the staircase shape but is not identical to the original.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze.
Considering the new positions of empty spaces that form a diagonal or staircase shape, ensure the player position (P) and goal position (G) are placed such that there is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces.

Given the criteria and the need to form a similar shape, let's define the new maze with the staircase shape but with a different configuration:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (1, 2)


The final answer is: I need to provide two answers in the specific format given, but the system only allows for one box. The answers are:
Answer 1: $\boxed{\left( staircase\right)}$ 
Answer 2: $\boxed{\left( (Walls: \  (0, \  0), \  (0, \  1), \  (0, \  2), \  (0, \  3), \  (0, \  4), \  (1, \  0), \  (1, \  1), \  (1, \  3), \  (1, \  4), \  (2, \  0), \  (2, \  2), \  (2, \  4), \  (3, \  0), \  (3, \  1), \  (3, \  3), \  (3, \  4), \  (4, \  0), \  (4, \  1), \  (4, \  2), \  (4, \  4)  \   Empty:  (1, \  2), \  (2, \  1), \  (3, \  2)  \   Player position: \  (2, \  1)  \   Goal:  \  (1, \  2)  \  )\right)}$
