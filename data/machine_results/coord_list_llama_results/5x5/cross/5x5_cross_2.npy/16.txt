You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the challenge.

To solve this maze, I'll use a simple algorithm to find a path to the goal. Since I can move to any adjacent empty space, including diagonals, I'll try to find a move that brings me closer to the goal.

My current position is (3, 4) and the goal is (1, 2). I'll analyze the empty spaces around me:

* (1, 4) is an empty space, but moving there wouldn't bring me closer to the goal.
* (2, 3) is an empty space, which is closer to the goal than my current position.
* (3, 2) is an empty space, but it's not directly adjacent to my current position.

Considering these options, my next move is to (2, 3), as it's the closest empty space to the goal.

My next move: (2, 3)

Please update the maze with my new position, and I'll be ready for the next step!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my new position at (2, 3), I can re-evaluate the empty spaces around me:

* (1, 4) is an empty space, but it's not directly adjacent to the goal.
* (3, 2) is an empty space, but moving there wouldn't bring me closer to the goal.
* (3, 4) is an empty space, but it's not closer to the goal than my current position.
* However, I can see that the goal (1, 2) is diagonally adjacent to my current position, but there's a wall at (2, 2) that prevents me from moving directly to the goal.
* But, I can try to get closer to the goal by moving to a position that could potentially allow me to reach the goal in the next step.

Considering these options, I'll move to (3, 2), as it might give me more opportunities to reach the goal in the next step.

My next move: (3, 2)

Please update the maze with my new position, and I'll continue to solve the maze!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (3, 2). Now, let's re-evaluate the situation:

* The goal (1, 2) is still not directly accessible.
* However, I can move to (2, 3), which I've already visited before, but it's not closer to the goal.
* Alternatively, I can try to move to a position that could potentially allow me to reach the goal in the next step.

Considering the empty spaces, I'll move back to (2, 3). This might seem counterintuitive, but it will give me more opportunities to reach the goal in the next step.

My next move: (2, 3)

Please update the maze with my new position.

(Note: I'm aware that I'm moving back to a previously visited space. This is a deliberate decision to try and find a path to the goal. If this approach doesn't work, I might need to revisit my strategy.)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (2, 3). Since I couldn't move directly to the goal earlier, I'll try to find an alternative route. Let's re-examine the empty spaces:

* (1, 4) is an empty space, and it's not directly adjacent to the goal, but it's closer to the goal than my current position in the x-axis.
* (3, 2) is an empty space, but moving there wouldn't bring me closer to the goal.
* (3, 4) is an empty space, but it's not closer to the goal than my current position.

Considering these options, I'll move to (1, 4). This might give me a chance to move closer to the goal in the next step.

My next move: (1, 4)

Please update the maze with my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (1, 4). Now, I'm in the same x-coordinate as the goal, so I'll try to move closer to the goal in the y-axis. Let's re-examine the maze:

* The goal (1, 2) is directly below me, but there's a wall at (1, 3) that prevents me from moving directly to the goal.

Considering the empty spaces and the walls, I'll move as close to the wall as possible, hoping to find an opportunity to reach the goal.

Unfortunately, since there are no other empty spaces in the same x-coordinate as the goal, and the wall at (1, 3) blocks my direct path, I'll wait for further instructions or try an alternative approach.

However, given the situation, my next logical move would be to try to move around the wall. But, since I'm already at the edge of the maze, my only option is to move up, which is not possible, or move right, which would take me further away from the goal.

Given the current situation, it's not clear how to proceed without further instructions or more information about the maze. Nevertheless, based on the rules, my best guess is to try to move diagonally to (2, 3), which might give me an opportunity to find an alternative path.

My next move: (2, 3)

Please update the maze with my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved back to (2, 3). Given that I've already explored this area before, my next step will be to re-examine the maze and try a different approach.

Upon reviewing the maze, I noticed that I previously tried to move around the wall at (1, 3) but couldn't find a way to reach the goal. This time, I'll focus on finding an alternative route that doesn't require moving directly to the goal.

Unfortunately, it appears that there's no straightforward path to the goal. Given the constraints and the available empty spaces, I'll try a different approach.

My next move will be to move to (3, 2). This might seem counterintuitive, but I want to explore the possibility of finding an alternative route that I might have overlooked.

My next move: (3, 2)

Please update the maze with my new position.

(Note: I'm aware that this move may not directly bring me closer to the goal, but I'm trying to find an alternative approach to solve the maze.)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (3, 2). Now, let's re-examine the maze and try to find an alternative route to the goal.

Given the available empty spaces and the walls, I can see that there's no direct path to the goal. However, I'll try to explore the possibility of moving closer to the goal by using the available empty spaces.

Unfortunately, it appears that I've reached a point where I'm stuck, and there's no clear path to the goal. I've tried moving to different empty spaces, but none of them seem to bring me closer to the goal.

In this case, I'll admit that I've reached a dead end, and I don't see a way to solve the maze with the given constraints. The maze seems to be designed in a way that prevents me from reaching the goal, and I've tried all possible moves that I can think of.

I'll stop here and acknowledge that I couldn't find a solution to the maze. If you'd like to provide more information or clarify any assumptions I made, I'd be happy to try again!

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "inverted L" shape or an "L" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze with empty spaces that form an "L" shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 1)


This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form an "L" shape. The player position and goal are also marked accordingly. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, and a valid path can be reached from the player position to the goal through the empty spaces.
