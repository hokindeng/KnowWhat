You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search algorithm. I will explore all possible paths from the current position and choose the shortest path that leads to the goal position.

From the current player position (3,4), I can move to the following adjacent empty spaces:

* (3, 2)
* (2, 3)

Since (2, 3) is closer to the goal position (1, 2), I will choose to move to (2, 3).

My next move is to (2, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2,3), I can move to the following adjacent empty spaces:

* (3, 2)
* (1, 4)
* (3, 4)
* (1, 2) 

Since (1, 2) is the goal position, I will choose to move to (1, 2).

However, I notice that (1, 2) is not in the list of empty spaces, which means that my move may not be valid. But (1, 4) is in the list of empty spaces, and I can move to (1, 4) first and then try to find a way to (1, 2).

My next move is to (1, 4).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1,4), I can see that the goal position (1,2) is nearby, but it is blocked by a wall at (1,3). I will need to find a different path to reach the goal.

Since I am already at (1,4), I can move to any adjacent empty space. However, I see that there are no adjacent empty spaces except for (2,3), (3,2) and (3, 4) which are two steps away.

My next move is to (2, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2,3), I can see that the goal position (1,2) is not directly accessible due to the wall at (1,3) and (2,2). However, I can move to the empty space at (3,2) and explore further options.

My next move is to (3, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3,2), I can move to the following adjacent empty spaces:

* (2, 3)
* (3, 4)

I have already explored the path from (2,3) earlier, so I will choose to move to (3, 4) to explore a new path.

However, I realize that moving to (3, 4) will take me further away from the goal position (1, 2). Upon reviewing the maze, I realize that I have explored all possible paths and it seems that I have reached a dead end.

Unfortunately, I must admit that I have failed to find a path to the goal position (1, 2) from the initial position (3, 4) due to the maze structure.

If there was a mistake in my previous moves or if the maze is solvable, please let me know so I can re-evaluate the maze. Otherwise, I conclude that the maze is unsolvable.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) Disconnected diagonal line segments.

The original maze had a few disconnected empty spaces that formed short diagonal line segments.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria, with empty spaces that form a similar shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and has empty spaces that form disconnected diagonal line segments, similar to the original maze. Note that the new maze is not an identical copy of the original.
