You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. 

First, let's analyze the given maze information:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Since we can move in any of the 8 adjacent directions (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), let's find the nearest available empty space to move towards the goal. 

A potential next step would be to move diagonally up and left to (2, 3). This move will position us in a spot where we can potentially make progress towards the goal location in future steps.

So, my next move would be to: (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

Since I'm at (2, 3) and the goal is (1, 2), a logical next step would be to try to move closer to the goal. However, (1, 3) is a wall, and (2, 2) is also a wall. 

A potential next step would be to move diagonally up and left to (1, 4), which is an empty space. This move would allow us to progress towards the goal location, albeit indirectly, since we cannot move directly to (1, 2) or (1, 3) due to walls.

So, my next move would be to: (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1, 4) and the goal is (1, 2), my next move should be to move closer to the goal.

Since I'm already at the correct x-coordinate (1) for the goal, I should try to decrease the y-coordinate to approach the goal. However, I notice that (1, 3) is a wall, which blocks my direct path to the goal.

But I can move diagonally down and left to (2, 3), which is an empty space, to potentially find an alternative route to the goal in future steps.

So, my next move would be to: (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at (2, 3), let's reassess the situation.

To reach the goal at (1, 2), I need to move diagonally up and left, but (1, 3) is a wall, and (2, 2) is also a wall. I also don't want to go back to (1, 4) since that wouldn't make progress.

A possible next step would be to move down to (3, 2), which is an empty space. From there, I might be able to find an alternative route to the goal in future steps.

So, my next move would be to: (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 2) and the goal is (1, 2), a logical next step would be to try to move closer to the goal, which is directly up. However, I have a wall at (2, 2) and (1, 3) is also a wall to the left of my desired goal, with another wall at (2, 1) two spaces up and one space left.

Since my movement options are somewhat constrained by the nearby walls, I could try moving up diagonally to (2, 3), an empty space. This move would help me progress towards the goal and potentially find an alternative route to (1, 2) in future steps.

So, my next move would be to: (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (2, 3) again. I still need to find a way to reach (1, 2).

After re-evaluating the maze, I notice that I've explored most of the potential paths. However, I haven't tried moving up to (1, 4) and then potentially moving left to find an alternative route.

Wait, I've already tried that path! I need to think of something else.

Let me take a closer look at the maze... Ah, I think I can try moving back down to (3, 2) and then maybe find another path from there.

But that's not a new move. I need to think of something else.

After re-evaluating the maze again, I notice that I can try moving diagonally down and right to (3, 4), an empty space. This move might not seem directly related to the goal, but it's a new area to explore, and maybe I'll find a way to reach the goal from there.

So, my next move would be to: (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 4) and the goal is (1, 2), my next step should be to move closer to the goal.

Since (2, 4) is a wall, my options are limited. However, I can move diagonally up and left to (2, 3), an empty space. This move will allow me to progress towards the goal location, albeit indirectly.

From (2, 3), I may be able to find a path to the goal in future steps.

So, my next move would be to: (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at (2, 3) and the goal is (1, 2), I realize that I've reached a dead end in my exploration of the maze.

However, upon reviewing my previous attempts, I notice that I haven't tried one specific move: moving back to (3, 2). I've been there before, but it's worth exploring the options from that location again.

Wait, that's not a new move.

Upon further analysis, I see that I've exhausted all the possible paths and strategies. It seems that there's no possible solution to the maze with the given layout of walls and empty spaces.

Unfortunately, I must conclude that the maze has no solution, and it's not possible to reach the goal from the starting position.

Am I correct to assume that this is the case?

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems I was wrong about the maze having no solution. Since I'm back at (3, 2) again, I'll review the options.

I've tried many paths before, but I notice that I haven't found a way to reach the goal yet. One option is to go back to (2, 3), but I've been there many times before.

Wait, I think I'll try to go back to (3, 4). It's a location I've visited before, but maybe I can find something I missed earlier.

So, my next move would be to: (3, 4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a "broken L-shape" since it's not a perfect L, but rather a combination of horizontal and vertical segments.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (2, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape or broken L-shape.
