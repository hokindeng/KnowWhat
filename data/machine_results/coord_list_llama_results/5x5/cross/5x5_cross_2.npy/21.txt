You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search algorithm. Since I can only move through empty spaces, my next move will be to one of the adjacent empty spaces. 

From the current player position (3, 4), the only adjacent empty space is not directly listed, which means I need to examine all empty spaces to find the closest one that would be a valid move considering diagonal movements. Among the given empty spaces, (1, 4) seems like a candidate because it's closer than the others when considering diagonal steps.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 4) or directly to (1, 4) if diagonal moves are counted as single steps, but since (2, 4) is listed as a wall, I cannot move there, leaving me with no choice but to consider a move that isn't directly listed but can be inferred. However, given the provided empty spaces, a direct diagonal move to (1, 4) is the most logical and closest step towards reaching the goal. Thus, my answer is based on this logical inference despite the rules implying a direct move to any adjacent space including diagonals.

Given this context and reevaluating my capabilities, the logical step would be to an unlisted but implied connective empty space towards (1, 4), but directly selecting (1, 4) without an explicit mention of a path to it means I've jumped in reasoning without an intermediate step like considering paths to adjacent non-wall spaces directly connected to the player.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a diagonal line from top right to bottom left.


Here's a new maze that forms the same shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (0, 2)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (4, 0)


This maze has the same size as the original, and it includes a path from P to G through empty spaces. It's not an identical copy, but the general shape of the empty spaces still forms a diagonal line.
