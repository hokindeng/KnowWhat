You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the challenge.

To solve this maze, I'll use a simple algorithm: I'll explore the available options from the current position and move to the one that gets me closer to the goal. Since I can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), I'll evaluate each possible move and choose the best one.

From the current player position (3, 4), I can see that there are only two empty spaces to move to: (2, 3) and (3, 2). Since the goal is at (1, 2), I'll choose the move that gets me closer to the goal.

My next move is to (3, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I'll plan my next move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors)**

After analyzing the original maze, I can see that the empty spaces form a roughly diagonal or "staircase" shape, connecting the bottom-right corner (where the player starts) to the top-left part of the maze (where the goal is).

**2. A new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape**

Here is a new maze with the same size and staircase-like shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 0)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a staircase-like shape, but the wall and empty space placements are different from the original maze.
