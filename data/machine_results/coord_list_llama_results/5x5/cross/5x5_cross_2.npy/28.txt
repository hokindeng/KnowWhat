You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the player can move in any diagonal direction or up, down, left, right. However, given the constraints of the maze and the positions provided, there's an incorrect assumption about the available moves. Specifically, the problem states that the player can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position, but it does not specify that the player can move through walls or outside the boundaries of the maze to get to an empty space. The error lies in the understanding of what constitutes an "adjacent" empty space given the maze's layout.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the constraints of movement.
The player can move up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an empty space that is directly adjacent to the current position, without going through walls.

## Step 2: Identify all adjacent empty spaces to the current player position.
From the current player position (3, 4), the adjacent empty spaces need to be identified. Given the empty spaces are (1, 4), (2, 3), and (3, 2), and considering the maze layout and movement constraints, the only valid move that respects the maze's boundaries and wall constraints is moving to space (1, 4) as it is the only directly accessible empty space from (3, 4).

## Step 3: Determine the best next move based on the goal position.
The goal is (1, 2), and the current position is (3, 4). Given the directly accessible empty spaces, the move to (3, 2) is not possible directly from (3, 4) without crossing a wall or moving outside the maze boundaries, which is not allowed. The only valid and directly accessible move is to (1, 4), which also starts moving the player closer to the goal position in terms of the distance on the x-axis.

## Step 4: Choose the next position based on the closest distance to the goal that is achievable within the constraints of the maze.
Considering the only valid move is to (1, 4), this becomes the best next move as it's the only move that advances the player towards the goal without violating the maze's rules.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Given the coordinates of the empty spaces (1, 4), (2, 3), and (3, 2), it appears that the general shape formed by these spaces is a diagonal line or a staircase pattern from top-right to bottom-left.

## Step 2: Determine the size of the original maze.
The original maze is a 5x5 grid, as indicated by the coordinates ranging from (0, 0) to (4, 4).

## Step 3: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same shape.
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we can rotate the diagonal line or staircase pattern to run from top-left to bottom-right, or we can shift the positions of the empty spaces while maintaining the same diagonal orientation.

## Step 4: Define the new maze.
Let's define a new maze where the empty spaces form a similar diagonal or staircase pattern but with different coordinates.

## Step 5: Specify the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position for the new maze.
For the new maze, we can set the walls to block direct paths while allowing a diagonal or staircase path through the empty spaces.

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4)

Player position (P): (4, 4) is a wall in the new maze, so let's place the player at (3, 4) which is part of the path.

Goal (G): (1, 1) is not a valid goal since it is a wall, so let's place the goal at (1, 3) which is part of the path.

## Step 6: Finalize the new maze description.
The general shape of the empty spaces in the original maze is a diagonal line or staircase. Here is the new maze:

The final answer is: 

Diagonal/Staircase

 Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4)

Player position: (3, 4)

Goal: (1, 3)
