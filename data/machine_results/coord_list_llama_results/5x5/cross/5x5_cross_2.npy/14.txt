You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the player can move in any diagonal direction or up, down, left, right. However, given the constraints of the maze and the positions provided, there's an error in determining the viable adjacent position. The correct calculation should consider the actual adjacent empty spaces given the player's current position.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 2D grid with coordinates ranging from (0,0) to (4,4). Walls are denoted by specific coordinates, and there are also coordinates for empty spaces, the current player position, and the goal position.

## Step 2: Identify the goal
The goal is to navigate from the current player position (P) at (3,4) to the goal position (G) at (1,2), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 3: Determine the viable movement options
Given the current player position (3,4), we need to consider the available empty spaces to move towards the goal position. The provided empty spaces are (1,4), (2,3), and (3,2). The closest and most direct viable empty space towards the goal from the player position is at (3,2).

## Step 4: Plan the initial move
Since we aim to move towards the goal position (1,2), the most logical first move would be towards the adjacent position (3,2) as it directly moves closer to the goal without hitting any walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original problem didn't require this analysis, but rather it was part of the subsequent instructions.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the general shape of the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze.
By examining the coordinates provided for the empty spaces (1,4), (2,3), and (3,2), it appears the general shape formed by these empty spaces is a diagonal line from top right to bottom left.

## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size that forms the same shape with its empty spaces.
To generate a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to place walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position in a way that forms a diagonal line from top right to bottom left, similar to the original maze but not an identical copy.

## Step 3: Place the walls and empty spaces in the new maze.
Given the maze size is a 5x5 grid, we can position walls around the perimeter and place the empty spaces in a diagonal line from top right (0,4) to bottom left (4,0). For simplicity, we place the player position near the start of the diagonal line and the goal position near the end.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original.
Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (3,0), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)
Empty: (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0)
Player position: (0,4)
Goal: (4,0)

The final answer is: Mazes do not require a boxed answer.
