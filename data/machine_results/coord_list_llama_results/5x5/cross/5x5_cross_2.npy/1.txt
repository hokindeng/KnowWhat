You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the challenge.

To solve this maze, I'll use a simple algorithm: I'll explore the available options from the current position and move to the one that gets me closer to the goal. Since I can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), I'll evaluate all possible moves and choose the one that minimizes the distance to the goal.

From the current player position (3, 4), I have the following available moves:

* Up: Not possible (wall)
* Down: Not possible (out of bounds)
* Left: (3, 3) is a wall, but (3, 2) is an empty space (diagonal move)
* Right: Not possible (out of bounds)
* Up-Left: Not possible (wall)
* Up-Right: Not possible (out of bounds)
* Down-Left: Not possible (out of bounds)
* Down-Right: Not possible (out of bounds)

After evaluating the options, I'll move to (3, 2), as it is the only available empty space that gets me closer to the goal.

My next move is: (3, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors)**

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

**2. A new maze with the same shape**

Here's a new maze with the same size (5x5) and an L-shaped corridor:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and its corridors form an L-shape. It is not an identical copy of the original maze.
