You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the next best move from the player's position (3,4) would be to move diagonally to (2,3). However, this fails to consider the direct path to the goal. The correct approach should directly aim for the goal (1,2) from the player's current position, considering the constraints of the maze.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the Maze Layout
First, visualize the maze layout based on the given coordinates for walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position.

## Step 2: Determine Possible Moves
From the player's current position (3,4), identify all possible moves to adjacent empty spaces. Given the maze constraints, the player can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze Path to Goal
Analyze the possible paths from the current player position to the goal position (1,2), taking into account the need to avoid walls and only move through empty spaces.

## Step 4: Choose the Next Move
Considering the need to move towards the goal position and the restrictions imposed by the maze, determine the best next move. Since the goal is at (1,2) and there's an empty space at (2,3), but considering a more direct path to the goal is not possible due to the wall layout, we need to consider a viable path that steers closer to the goal while avoiding obstacles.

## Step 5: Select the Optimal Direction
Given the current position and the goal position, and the fact that we cannot move directly to the goal due to the walls, we should aim to move to an empty space that gets us closer to the goal while navigating through the maze's restrictions.

## Step 6: Provide the Move Coordinates
Considering the empty spaces available and the goal to reach, the optimal move from the current player position (3,4) directly towards the goal (1,2) is actually constrained by the maze. Thus, we have to identify a feasible move that aligns with reaching the goal efficiently.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the General Shape Formed by the Empty Spaces
The empty spaces in the original maze are at coordinates (1,4), (2,3), and (3,2). By visualizing these points, it can be observed that they form a diagonal line. Thus, the general shape formed by the empty spaces can be described as a diagonal line or a diagonal path.

## Step 2: Create a New Maze with the Same Shape of Empty Spaces
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, the size of the maze must remain 5x5, it must include a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, it must not be an identical copy of the original maze, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces must resemble a diagonal line.

## Step 3: Design the New Maze Layout
The walls and empty spaces need to be rearranged to create a new maze that allows for a path from a new player position (P) to a new goal position (G), ensuring the path resembles a diagonal line.

## Step 4: Encode the New Maze
Encode the new maze using the same format as the original, specifying the coordinates of the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position. The maze needs to ensure that the path from P to G follows a diagonal line, similar to the original maze but not identical.

## Step 5: Specify the New Maze Coordinates
Given the constraints and requirements, a possible new maze could have the following configuration:
- Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,3), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (1,3), (2,4)
- Empty: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4)
- Player position: (1,4) is not feasible as per new empty spaces, so let's correct it to (1,2)
- Goal: Considering the diagonal path, a suitable goal could be (3,4)

However, upon further inspection, the new configuration provided above doesn't comply perfectly with the instructions as it directly takes parts from the thought process without adjusting for an entirely new maze that strictly follows the diagonal path requirement and provides a new, unique setup. To correct this and provide a valid answer according to the instructions:

Given the realization that the attempt to generate a new maze in Step 5 was flawed, and to adhere strictly to the format and provide a correct answer as requested:

The final answer is: There is no direct answer provided in the reasoning that adheres to the requested format due to the error in generating a new maze in Step 5.
