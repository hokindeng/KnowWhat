You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the player can move in any diagonal direction or to any adjacent square, including those that are not horizontally or vertically adjacent. However, the problem statement says that the player can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. But, the player can only move to a square that is directly adjacent, not to any non-adjacent empty square.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the movement rules.
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). Movement can be up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 2: Identify the player's starting position and the goal position.
The player starts at (3, 4) and needs to reach (1, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze possible first moves from the player's current position.
Given the player's starting position at (3, 4), we need to identify which of the adjacent positions are empty. The adjacent positions are (3, 3), (3, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), and (4, 5). However, (3, 5) is out of the maze, and (2, 5), (4, 4), and (4, 5) are walls, and (4, 3) is also a wall.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on available options and the goal position.
Since the goal is at (1, 2), we need to move closer to it while avoiding walls. The empty adjacent square to (3, 4) that moves us towards the goal is (3, 3).

## Step 5: Move to the chosen position and update the player position.
Move to (3, 3). However, (3, 3) is a wall, not an empty space. Let's re-analyze the possible moves.


## Step 6: Re-analyze possible moves.
We need to move to an adjacent empty space. The only empty adjacent space to (3, 4) is (2, 4). However, (2, 4) is a wall. Let's look for a diagonal move. The empty spaces are (1, 4), (2, 3), and (3, 2), and one of them is diagonally adjacent to the current player's position.

## Step 7: Choose the correct diagonal move.
The only diagonally adjacent empty space is (2, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the movement rules.
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). Movement can be up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and the goal position.
The player is at (2, 3) and needs to reach (1, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze possible next moves from the player's current position.
Given the player's current position at (2, 3), we need to identify which of the adjacent positions are empty. The adjacent positions are (2, 2), (2, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), and (3, 4). However, (2, 2), (2, 4), (1, 3), and (3, 3) are walls.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on available options and the goal position.
Since the goal is at (1, 2) and it is diagonally adjacent to the current player's position, and (1, 2) is the goal position.

## Step 5: Move to the chosen position and update the player position.
Move to (1, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Based on the coordinates provided for the empty spaces in the original maze, (1, 4), (2, 3), and (3, 2), it appears the general shape formed by these spaces is a diagonal line from top-right to bottom-left.


## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same size and a valid path from P to G that forms the same shape as identified in Step 1.
To create a new maze with the same characteristics, we need to ensure it is 5x5, has a path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and the path forms a diagonal line from top-right to bottom-left.


## Step 3: Decide on the positions for P and G in the new maze.
Let's place P at (1, 4) and G at (4, 1) to create a diagonal path from top-right to bottom-left.


## Step 4: Determine the empty spaces needed to form the diagonal path.
Given P is at (1, 4) and G is at (4, 1), the empty spaces should form a diagonal line: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), and (4, 1).


## Step 5: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original.
The new maze will have the same walls as the original but with the new positions for P, G, and the empty spaces forming a diagonal line from top-right to bottom-left.


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 1)

The final answer is: For 1: $\boxed{diagonal}$
For 2: 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 1)
