You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the challenge.


After analyzing the maze, I will make my next move. Since the goal position is at (1, 2), I need to move in that direction while avoiding walls and using only empty spaces. My current position is at (3, 4).


I noticed that there is an empty space at (3, 2) and also at (2, 3). These two spaces are diagonally adjacent to each other, and both are relatively closer to the goal position than my current position.


My next move will be to (3, 2) since it is adjacent to my current position and brings me closer to the goal.


The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:


(1) An "L" shape.


The original maze had empty spaces at (1, 4), (2, 3), and (3, 2), which formed an "L" shape. This shape can be seen by visualizing the empty spaces as a corridor that makes a 90-degree turn.


Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 2)


In this new maze, the empty spaces at (1, 3), (2, 2), and (3, 4) form an "L" shape, similar to the original maze. The player can navigate from the starting position (1, 4) to the goal position (3, 2) by moving through the empty spaces. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape formed by the corridors.
