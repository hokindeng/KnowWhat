You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the challenge.

To solve this maze, I'll use a simple algorithm to find a path to the goal. Since I can move to any adjacent empty space, including diagonals, I'll explore all possible directions from the current player position.

From the player position (3, 4), I can move to:

* Up: (2, 4) - blocked by a wall
* Down: out of bounds
* Left: (3, 3) - blocked by a wall
* Right: out of bounds
* Up-left: (2, 3) - empty space!
* Up-right: out of bounds
* Down-left: out of bounds
* Down-right: out of bounds

My next move will be to the empty space (2, 3). This is a valid move since it's an adjacent empty space.

So, my response is: (2, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I'll be ready for the next step!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2, 3).

From the player position (2, 3), I can move to:

* Up: (1, 3) - blocked by a wall
* Down: (3, 3) - blocked by a wall
* Left: (2, 2) - blocked by a wall
* Right: (2, 4) - blocked by a wall
* Up-left: (1, 2) - the goal!
* Up-right: (1, 4) - empty space, but not the goal
* Down-left: (3, 2) - empty space, but not the goal
* Down-right: (3, 4) - empty space, but not the goal

Since I can see the goal (1, 2) from my current position, my next move will be to the goal (1, 2). This is a valid move since it's an adjacent empty space.

So, my response is: (1, 2)

Please let me know if I've reached the goal successfully!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors)**

After analyzing the original maze, I would say that the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a **Z-Shape** or a **Staircase Shape**.

**2. A new maze with the same shape**

Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces that form a Z-Shape or Staircase Shape:
```
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 4)
```
In this new maze, the empty spaces form a Z-Shape or Staircase Shape, similar to the original maze. The player position is at (3, 1), and the goal is at (1, 4). The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it meets all the criteria.
