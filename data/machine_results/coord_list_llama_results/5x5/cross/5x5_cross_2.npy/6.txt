You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the challenge.


After analyzing the maze, I decided to make my next move to (3, 3) -> no, wait, that's a wall.


My next move will be to (2, 4) -> no, that's a wall.


Let me think again...


Alright, I will move diagonally to (2, 3).


The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the update.


From my current position at (2, 3), I see that I'm getting close to the goal, but there's a wall at (2, 2).


Let me think... my next move will be to (1, 4) and then navigate from there.


The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1, 4), I'm above the goal position, but I need to get past the wall at (1, 3).


Since I can move diagonally, my next move will be to (2, 3), and then I can reassess.


The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at (2, 3), I'll try to get closer to the goal position.


My next move will be to try and get around the wall at (1, 3) by moving diagonally to (3, 2).


The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting closer!


Since I'm now at (3, 2), I'll try to move directly towards the goal position.


Unfortunately, I see a wall at (2, 2), so I'll move to the empty space above it, which is not an option.


Let me think... I can try moving to (2, 3) and see if I can find a path from there.


The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at (2, 3), I'll try to get closer to the goal position.


Let me think... since I'm one step away from the goal column, I'll move diagonally to get around the wall at (2, 2) and the wall below at (1, 3) isn't a problem as the goal (1,2) is above it


The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

What a great challenge!


After analyzing the original maze, I have concluded that:


(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a Staircase.


(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)


This new maze has a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces, which form the same Staircase shape. The path goes from (1, 4) to (2, 2) by navigating through the stairs: (1, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 2)
