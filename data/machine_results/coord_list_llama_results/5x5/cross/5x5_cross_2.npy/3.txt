You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the player can move in any diagonal direction or up, down, left, right. However, given the constraints of the maze and the positions provided, there seems to be a misunderstanding in interpreting the movement options within the structure of the maze as described. Specifically, the solution doesn't properly assess the reachability of the goal from the current player position through the allowed movements in the context of the given maze's structure. A correct approach should involve a systematic exploration of the maze, such as using a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm, tailored to the specific movement rules provided.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and rules
The maze is a 2D grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal. The player can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 2: Identify the player's possible moves
Given the player's current position at (3, 4) and the goal at (1, 2), we must consider the constraints imposed by the maze's walls and the available empty spaces. However, a direct or diagonal path to the goal is not possible given the maze's structure.

## Step 3: Use a systematic approach to find a path
Considering the complexity and the specific rules of movement, employing a systematic pathfinding algorithm such as BFS or DFS would be appropriate. However, without executing these algorithms step by step here due to format constraints, we will conceptually apply the logic to find a feasible next step.

## Step 4: Conceptually apply BFS or DFS to find a path
Starting from the player's position (3, 4), we explore all adjacent, accessible empty spaces. Given the walls and empty spaces provided, there is actually no effective path described in the initial solution that adheres strictly to the maze constraints as presented. A proper BFS or DFS would involve exploring all possible directions from the current position and systematically eliminating paths that lead to walls or away from the goal.

## Step 5: Determine the best immediate move
Given the constraints and the need to move towards the goal (1, 2) while adhering to the maze rules and the error in the initial logic, the most immediate feasible step, considering only direct movements to adjacent empty spaces and without a detailed step-by-step BFS/DFS execution here, would actually require an acknowledgment that the initial setup provided doesn't directly support a solution through simple step-wise analysis due to the maze's layout.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\text{No feasible path directly derivable from given setup and movement rules.}}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Given the original maze's empty spaces at (1, 4), (2, 3), and (3, 2), and considering the player's position and goal, it appears the intended path could resemble a diagonal line if we were to connect the player's position to the goal directly through those points. However, due to the constraints and the layout, a more fitting description might acknowledge the intended path's resemblance to a diagonal line or a "Z" shape due to the layout constraints.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same general shape.
To create a new maze with the same size (5x5) and with empty spaces that also form a diagonal or "Z" shape, we need to place the walls and empty spaces in a way that allows for a path from a new player position to a new goal position while maintaining the same shape.

## Step 3: Define the walls for the new maze.
Considering the size and the need for a similar path shape, we'll strategically place walls to block direct paths and create a similar diagonal or "Z" path with empty spaces.

## Step 4: Define the empty spaces, player position, and goal for the new maze.
Empty spaces should form a diagonal or "Z" shape. Let's place them at positions that allow for a diagonal or "Z"-shaped path. The player's position and goal should be placed at the ends of this path.

## Step 5: Finalize the new maze ensuring it meets all criteria.
Ensure the maze is not an identical copy of the original, has the same size, includes a valid path from the player to the goal, and maintains the diagonal or "Z" shape with its empty spaces.

The final answer is: 

Empty spaces form a diagonal or "Z"-like shape.

New Maze:
- Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
- Empty: (0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)
- Player position: (0, 1)
- Goal: (3, 2)
