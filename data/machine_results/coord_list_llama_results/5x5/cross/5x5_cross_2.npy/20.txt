You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the challenge.

To solve this maze, I'll use a simple algorithm to find a path to the goal. Since I can move to any adjacent empty space, including diagonals, I'll try to find a move that brings me closer to the goal.

My current position is (3, 4) and the goal is (1, 2). I'll analyze the empty spaces around me:

* (1, 4) is an empty space, but moving there wouldn't bring me closer to the goal.
* (2, 3) is an empty space, which is closer to the goal than my current position.
* (3, 2) is an empty space, but it's not directly adjacent to my current position.

Considering these options, my next move is to (2, 3), as it's the closest empty space to the goal.

My next move: (2, 3)

Please update the maze with my new position, and I'll be ready for the next step!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my current position at (2, 3) and the goal at (1, 2), my next step is to try to get closer to the goal.

The empty spaces around me are:

* (1, 4) is an empty space, but moving there wouldn't bring me closer to the goal.
* (3, 2) is an empty space, but moving there would also not bring me closer to the goal.
* (3, 4) is an empty space, but it's also not a move that brings me closer to the goal.

However, I notice that the goal is just one step away diagonally. Unfortunately, there is a wall at (1, 3), which prevents me from moving directly to the goal.

But I can try to get around that wall by moving to a position that will allow me to reach the goal on the next move.

After analyzing the maze, I realize that I need to get to (1, 4) to have a clear path to the goal.

My next move: (1, 4)

Please update the maze with my new position, and I'll be ready for the next step!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my current position at (1, 4) and the goal at (1, 2), my next move is straightforward.

I'll simply move down to the goal, but since there's a wall at (1, 3), I'll move diagonally to avoid it.

In this case, I'll move to the goal directly.

My next move: (1, 2)

Please update the maze with my new position. I should have reached the goal!

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors)**

The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "Staircase" or a "Zig-Zag" pattern.

**2. A new maze with the same shape**

Here's a new maze with the same size and a similar "Staircase" or "Zig-Zag" pattern:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from the player position to the goal. The empty spaces form a similar "Staircase" or "Zig-Zag" pattern, but the maze is not an identical copy of the original.
