You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the player can move in any diagonal direction in addition to the up, down, left, and right directions. However, upon reviewing the problem again, it's clear that the maze's constraints and the given empty spaces indicate that diagonal movement is indeed an option, but the chosen next move (2, 4) is incorrect because it doesn't lead directly towards the goal and there's a closer empty space at (3, 2) which was overlooked.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is represented by a list of wall coordinates, a list of empty space coordinates, a player position, and a goal position. The top-left corner is (0,0), and movements can be up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 2: Analyze the current player position
The player is at position (3, 4), and the goal is to reach (1, 2).

## Step 3: Identify the closest empty space that leads to the goal
Looking at the empty spaces: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), the closest one to the player that leads towards the goal without backtracking is (3, 2).

## Step 4: Determine the best immediate move
Given the available options, the most direct path towards the goal from the player's current position is (3, 2), as it does not involve moving away from the goal and utilizes the maze's structure efficiently.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
Looking at the coordinates of the empty spaces in the original maze: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), it appears that they form a diagonal line or a staircase shape from the top-right to the bottom-left of the maze.


## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with the same shape of empty spaces
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to generate new wall and empty space coordinates that form the same diagonal or staircase shape, but are not identical to the original maze.


## Step 3: Define the new maze's walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position
New Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
New Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
New Player position: (3, 1)
New Goal: (1, 3)


## Step 4: Ensure the new maze is valid and solvable
The new maze has the same size as the original (5x5), includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a diagonal or staircase shape.


The final answer is: 


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)
