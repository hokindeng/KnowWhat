You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the challenge.


After analyzing the maze, I will make my next move. Since the goal position is at (1, 2), I need to move in that direction while avoiding walls and using only empty spaces. Currently, the player position is at (3, 4).

My next move will be to move diagonally to the empty space at (2, 3). This move will bring me closer to the goal position while avoiding walls.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (2, 3).


Please update the maze with my new position, and I'll be ready for the next step!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After analyzing the updated maze, I see that I need to get closer to the goal position at (1, 2). Since I'm currently at (2, 3), I'll move to the empty space at (3, 2), which is diagonally down and to the left of my current position, and then I can try to find a path upwards and to the left towards the goal position in subsequent moves.


However, since I can move in eight directions and one space (cardinal and intercardinal), I also checked the spaces adjacent to the goal, and noticed that if I move diagonally upwards and to the left to the position (1, 4), it is only one space away (diagonal) from the goal (1,2), in position to move right towards it in the subsequent turn.


Therefore, I will make my next move to (1, 4) to position myself for a potential goal on the following move.


So, the coordinates of my next move are: (1, 4).

Let me know the updated maze!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1, 4) and my goal is at (1, 2), I notice that I can directly move left to reach the goal since the x-coordinate is the same.


So, I'll make my next move to the goal position itself!


The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 2).


Please update the maze and let me know if I've solved it successfully!

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Fun task!


(1) After analyzing the original maze, I'd say that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "Hook" or a " Bent L" shape.


(2) Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "Hook" or "Bent L" shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 2)


This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and forms a recognizable "Hook" or "Bent L" shape with its empty spaces.


Have fun solving it!
