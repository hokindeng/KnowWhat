You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the player can move in any diagonal direction in addition to the up, down, left, and right directions. However, upon reviewing the problem again, it's clear that the player can indeed move in any diagonal direction within the empty spaces. But the oversight is in not considering the diagonal moves in the solution steps provided.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the maze layout and the player's movement options.
The player can move to any empty space adjacent to the current position. The maze layout and the coordinates of the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position will guide the movement choices.

## Step 2: Identify the closest empty space to the player's current position that moves towards the goal position.
From the player's current position at (3, 4), the closest empty space moving towards the goal (1, 2) while avoiding walls is diagonally at (2, 3).

## Step 3: Determine the direction of movement to reach the identified empty space.
The player can move diagonally to (2, 3), as this space is empty and more directly aligns with the goal position (1, 2).

## Step 4: Provide the coordinates of the next move based on the analysis.
Given the available movement options and the need to avoid walls while moving towards the goal, the best next move from (3, 4) would be diagonally to (2, 3).

## Step 5: Consider subsequent moves to ensure a path to the goal.
After reaching (2, 3), the next logical move towards the goal (1, 2) would be diagonally to (1, 2), but since we need to provide the immediate next move from the player's current position (3, 4), we focus on the move to (2, 3).

# Correct Answer

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original approach correctly analyzes the maze and identifies the next best move.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the updated maze layout and the player's new position.
Considering the player's new position at (2, 3) and the goal at (1, 2), we need to find a path through the empty spaces that avoids walls.

## Step 2: Identify the closest empty space to the player's current position that moves towards the goal position.
The closest empty space is not directly adjacent in a way that moves closer to the goal due to the presence of walls. However, we can move to an empty space that could potentially lead to the goal.

## Step 3: Determine the direction of movement to reach the identified empty space.
Since we are at (2, 3) and the goal is at (1, 2), but there's a wall at (1, 3) and (2, 2), we need to consider moving to an empty space that could eventually lead to the goal.

## Step 4: Consider the available empty spaces and their potential for leading to the goal.
The empty spaces are (1, 4), (3, 2), and (3, 4). Moving to (3, 2) or (3, 4) does not directly advance towards the goal but moving to (1, 4) does in a way, as it gets us closer to the goal's column, and from there, we might find a path down to the goal.

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the next move based on the analysis.
Given the need to avoid walls and the layout of the empty spaces and the goal, the next move from (2, 3) would logically be to (1, 4), as this is the only move that gets us closer to the goal's X-coordinate.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original approach correctly identifies the need to move towards the goal but does not overlook potential moves.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal.
Given the player's position at (1, 4) and the goal at (1, 2), with a wall at (1, 3), we need to find a path around the wall.

## Step 2: Identify potential moves towards the goal.
Moving directly down to the goal is blocked by a wall at (1, 3), so we need to consider moving to an adjacent empty space that could lead to the goal.

## Step 3: Examine the available empty spaces.
The available empty spaces are (2, 3), (3, 2), and (3, 4). Since moving to (3, 4) does not advance us towards the goal directly and moving to (3, 2) involves going around the wall, we consider (2, 3) as it has the potential to move closer to the goal in the subsequent move.

## Step 4: Choose the best move.
Considering the need to avoid walls and the goal's position, moving diagonally to (2, 3) is an option to potentially get closer to the goal by avoiding the wall at (1, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

1. A right-angled zigzag or a stairstep shape.

To generate a new maze that meets the criteria, I present:

2. New Maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

This new maze has the same 5x5 size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is also a right-angled zigzag or stairstep, recognizing the same pattern as in the original maze.
