You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 3.
The original solution suggests moving diagonally to (3, 3). However, this ignores a closer and more direct path through (2, 2), which is an available empty space adjacent to the current player position (1, 1), albeit diagonally.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal
The player's current position is at (1, 1), and the goal is to reach (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the current position
From (1, 1), considering the constraints of the maze, the player can move to the following empty spaces: (2, 2).

## Step 3: Determine the best move
Among the possible moves, the best option is to move to (2, 2), as it brings the player closer to the goal and does not move away from the goal's column unnecessarily.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal
The player's current position is at (2, 2), and the goal is to reach (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the current position
From (2, 2), considering the constraints of the maze, the player can move to the following empty spaces: (1, 1), (3, 1), or (3, 3).

## Step 3: Determine the best move
Among the possible moves, moving to (1, 1) would backtrack, which is not ideal. The best option is to move to (3, 3) because it does not move directly away from the goal and keeps the player in a position to potentially move towards the goal in the next step, given the maze's constraints.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal
The player's current position is at (3, 3), and the goal is to reach (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the current position
From (3, 3), considering the constraints of the maze, the player can move to the following empty spaces: (2, 2).

## Step 3: Determine the best move
Among the possible moves, moving to (2, 2) is the only viable option and brings the player closer to the goal.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal
The player's current position is at (2, 2), and the goal is to reach (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the current position
From (2, 2), considering the constraints of the maze, the player can move to the following empty spaces: (1, 1) or (3, 1) or (3, 3).

## Step 3: Determine the best move
Among the possible moves, moving to (1, 1) would allow the player to potentially move up to the goal in the next step, given the maze's constraints.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal
The player's current position is at (1, 1), and the goal is to reach (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the current position
From (1, 1), considering the constraints of the maze, there are no direct moves to empty spaces. However, the goal is within reach if we consider it as a potential move since it's adjacent and there are no walls in the way of the goal itself, just a lack of listed empty spaces leading directly to it.


## Step 3: Determine the best move
Given the constraints and the goal's position, moving directly to the goal (1, 3) is the best and only logical move, assuming the maze allows movement into the goal position directly from the current player position.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The original maze had empty spaces that formed a shape resembling a diagonal line or a slash (/), connecting the top-left to the bottom-right of the maze but with a specific configuration that allowed movement from (1, 1) to (1, 3) through certain steps.


## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same general shape.
A new maze with the same size as the original and empty spaces that form a similar diagonal line or slash (/) shape but in a different configuration would meet the criteria. Here is a new maze encoded in the same format as the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)


The final answer is: There is no numerical answer for this problem as it requires descriptive and creative responses rather than numerical solutions.
