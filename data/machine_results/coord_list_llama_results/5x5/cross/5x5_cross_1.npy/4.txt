You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the challenge!

To solve this maze, I'll use a simple algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal. Since the maze is small, I can analyze it manually.

From the current player position (1, 1), I'll look for adjacent empty spaces. I can see that the only adjacent empty space is (2, 2), which is diagonally down-right.

So, my next move is to (2, 2).

New player position: (2, 2)

Please provide the updated maze, and I'll plan my next move!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 2), I need to find a way to reach the goal position (1, 3).

Looking at the maze, I notice that I can move to the empty space (1, 1) diagonally up-left, which would put me on the same row as the goal position.

However, since my ultimate goal is to reach (1, 3), I'd rather move closer to it. I can move to (3, 1) or (3, 3), but I'll choose (3, 3) because it's closer to the goal row.

So, my next move is to (3, 3).

New player position: (3, 3)

Please provide the updated maze, and I'll plan my next move!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting closer to the goal!

From the current player position (3, 3), I need to find a way to reach the goal position (1, 3).

Since I'm on the same column as the goal, I'll try to move up towards it. However, (2, 3) is a wall, so I need to find another way.

I can move to (3, 1) and then try to find a path to the goal. 

So, my next move is to (3, 1).

New player position: (3, 1)

Please provide the updated maze, and I'll plan my next move!

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would say that the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a "zig-zag" or a "staircase" shape.

Here's a new maze with the same size (5x5) and the same shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

This new maze has a zig-zag or staircase-shaped path, just like the original one, but it's not an identical copy. The path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G) can be reached by moving through the empty spaces.
