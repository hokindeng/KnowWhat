You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (1, 1), and the goal is (1, 3). The available empty spaces are (2, 2), (3, 1), and (3, 3).

Since I can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonal), I will try to get closer to the goal. The most direct path would be to move right, but (1, 2) is a wall. Therefore, I will try to move diagonally to get closer to the goal.

My next move will be to (2, 2), as it is the closest empty space that brings me closer to the goal.

Next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 2), I need to find a way to get closer to the goal (1, 3). Since I'm blocked by a wall at (1, 2) and (2, 3), I'll try to move to a position that will allow me to get around the wall.

I notice that (3, 1) and (3, 3) are empty spaces. Moving to (3, 3) would put me in a position to potentially move diagonally to the goal, but it's not a direct path. Moving to (3, 1) would not bring me closer to the goal.

However, I can try to move to (1, 1), which is now an empty space. From there, I might be able to find a way to move closer to the goal.

My next move will be to (1, 1).

Next move: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at (1, 1), I'll try to find a way to get closer to the goal (1, 3). Since I'm blocked by a wall at (1, 2), I'll try to move around it.

I notice that (2, 2) is an empty space, and I've been there before. However, I can try to move diagonally to (2, 2) and then potentially move to a position that will allow me to reach the goal.

But wait, I can also try to move directly to the goal by jumping over the wall at (1, 2) to the empty space that is the goal (1, 3). Unfortunately, I am not allowed to jump over walls.

My next move will be to (2, 2), and from there, I'll try to find a way to get closer to the goal.

Next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (2, 2) again. Since I've already explored the option of moving to (1, 1), I'll try to find another way to get closer to the goal (1, 3).

I notice that (3, 3) is an empty space, and it's diagonally adjacent to the goal. If I can move to (3, 3), I might be able to find a way to move to the goal from there.

My next move will be to (3, 3).

Next move: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 3), I'll try to find a way to get closer to the goal (1, 3). Since I'm diagonally adjacent to the goal, I'll try to move diagonally to the goal.

However, I notice that (2, 2) is an empty space, and it's closer to the goal than my current position. I can try to move diagonally to (2, 2) and then potentially move to the goal.

But wait, I can also try to move directly to the goal (1, 3). Since I'm diagonally adjacent to the goal, I can move diagonally to the goal.

My next move will be to (1, 3), which is the goal.

Next move: (1, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Z" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a "Z" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a "Z" shape.
