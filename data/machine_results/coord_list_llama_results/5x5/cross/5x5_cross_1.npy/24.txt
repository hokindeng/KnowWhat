You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The walls are denoted by coordinates, and the empty spaces are also given. The player starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach the goal at (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the current position
From the player's current position (1, 1), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the best next move
Looking at the maze, we see that moving directly to the goal (1, 3) is blocked by a wall at (1, 2). We need to find an alternative route. The closest empty space to the player's current position is (2, 2), which is diagonally up and to the right.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Given the constraints of the maze and the goal, the best next move is to (2, 2). This move gets us closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Re-evaluate the maze after the previous move
The player is now at (2, 2), and the goal remains at (1, 3). We need to find a way to get closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the new position
From (2, 2), we can consider moving in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal) to an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze for the best next move
Since the goal is at (1, 3) and there's a wall at (1, 2), we cannot move directly to the goal. However, we can move diagonally down and to the left to (1, 1), which is now an empty space, or we can move down to (3, 1) or (3, 3) to try and find a path around the walls.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the options, moving to (1, 1) gets us closer to the goal but still leaves the wall at (1, 2) as an obstacle. Moving to (3, 1) or (3, 3) does not directly advance us towards the goal but provides options for future moves. Given the direct approach is blocked, we should consider alternative paths that might allow us to circumvent the wall blocking the goal.

## Step 5: Select the most promising move
Given the constraints and the need to find an alternative path, moving to (3, 3) seems the most promising as it keeps us in the vicinity of the goal and provides the most flexibility for the next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the new position and options
The player is now at (3, 3), and the goal is still at (1, 3). We need to navigate around the walls to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the current position
From (3, 3), we can consider moving to any adjacent empty space. Given the walls, our options are limited.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze for the best next move
Since the goal is at (1, 3) and we are at (3, 3), we need to move left to get closer to the goal. However, there's a wall at (2, 3), blocking our direct path. We must find an alternative route.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Given the wall at (2, 3), we cannot move directly left. However, we can move up to (2, 2), which is an empty space. This move gets us closer to the goal vertically and provides a potential path to move around the wall blocking our direct path to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Re-evaluate the maze and options
The player is back at (2, 2), and the goal remains at (1, 3). We need to find a way to navigate around the walls to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the current position
From (2, 2), we can consider moving to any adjacent empty space. Given the walls and the empty spaces, our options are limited.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze for the best next move
Since the goal is at (1, 3) and we are at (2, 2), we need to move left and down to get closer to the goal. However, there's a wall at (1, 2), blocking our direct path left, and a wall at (2, 3), blocking our direct path down. We must find an alternative route.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Given the walls blocking our direct paths, we can move diagonally down and to the left to (1, 1), which is an empty space. This move gets us closer to the goal horizontally and provides a potential path to move around the walls blocking our direct path to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the new position and options
The player is now at (1, 1), and the goal is at (1, 3). We need to navigate around the walls to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the current position
From (1, 1), we can consider moving to any adjacent empty space. Given the walls, our options are limited.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze for the best next move
Since the goal is at (1, 3) and we are at (1, 1), we need to move down to get closer to the goal. However, there's a wall at (1, 2), blocking our direct path. But we notice that the goal (1, 3) is just below the wall, and there's no wall at the goal's position.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Given the wall at (1, 2), we cannot move directly down to (1, 2), but we can move down to (1, 3) as it is an empty space and our goal. This move gets us directly to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze had empty spaces at (2, 2), (3, 1), and (3, 3), which formed a diagonal or a zigzag shape. However, considering the path from the player's position to the goal, the general shape can be seen as a diagonal line with a detour or a step, resembling a stair or an "L" shape with an additional step.

## Step 2: Determine the name of the general shape
Given the configuration of the empty spaces and the path from the player to the goal, the general shape can be described as a "stair" or a "zigzag" but most closely resembles a "step" shape or a modified "L" shape. However, the most fitting description considering the maze's constraints and the path's nature would be a "zigzag" or "staircase" shape, acknowledging the diagonal movement with a detour.

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same size and a path forming the same general shape
To create a new maze, we need to ensure it's the same size (5x5), has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original, and forms a "zigzag" or "staircase" shape with its empty spaces.

## Step 4: Define the new maze
Let's define the new maze with the player position (P) at (1, 1), the goal (G) at (3, 3), and empty spaces that form a zigzag or staircase shape. We'll place walls to ensure the path from P to G is not a straight line but follows the desired shape.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze
Here is the new maze encoded in the same format as the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

However, to strictly follow the format requested for the final answer, which seems to expect numerical values only, and given the instructions were to provide the name of the shape and a new maze but the format doesn't accommodate for the description of the shape or the detailed maze layout as requested, I'll adjust accordingly for the final answer section, focusing on the numerical aspect which doesn't apply directly here.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$
