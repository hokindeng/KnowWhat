You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move. Based on the current player position (1, 1) and the available empty spaces, my next move will be to the position (2, 2).

This is because (2, 2) is an empty space adjacent to the current player position, and it looks like it might be a good stepping stone to eventually reach the goal position (1, 3).

So, my next move is: (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I'll plan my next move.

From my current position (2, 2), I can see that (1, 1) is now an empty space, but I've already been there. The goal position (1, 3) is still not accessible directly.

However, I can see that (3, 1) is an empty space adjacent to my current position, and it might lead to a path that can eventually reach the goal. Since (3, 3) is also an empty space, it's possible that I can use (3, 1) as a stepping stone to get to (3, 3) and then try to find a way to the goal.

So, my next move is: (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

From my current position (3, 1), I can see that the empty space (3, 3) is a good candidate for my next move. It's adjacent to my current position, and it's also relatively close to the goal position (1, 3).

Additionally, (3, 3) is a more central position, which might give me more options for my next move. I can try to find a way to the goal from there.

So, my next move is: (3, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and L-shaped corridors:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Note that this new maze has an L-shaped corridor, just like the original, but it is not an identical copy. The empty spaces are positioned differently, but the overall L-shape is still recognizable.
