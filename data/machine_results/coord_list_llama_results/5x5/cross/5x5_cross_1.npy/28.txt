You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will analyze the given information and plan a step-by-step path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Given the current player position is (1, 1) and the goal is (1, 3), and considering the positions of the walls and empty spaces, the most direct path would involve moving right towards the goal. However, there's a wall at (1, 2), which means I cannot move directly to the goal.

Considering the available empty spaces, a viable path involves moving down to (2, 1) and then diagonally up-right to (1, 3), but since (2, 1) is a wall, this path is not possible. The correct approach is to move down to (3, 1), which is an empty space, and then find a way to navigate closer to the goal from there.

Given the constraints and the layout, my next move would be to (3, 1), as it's the only immediate empty space accessible from (1, 1) that could potentially lead to a path towards the goal.

Next move: (3, 1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "Z-shape" or a "zigzag".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar Z-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a Z-shape, similar to the original maze. The player can navigate from the starting position (1, 1) to the goal position (3, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape and structure.
