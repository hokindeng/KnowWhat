You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution suggests moving diagonally to (3, 3). However, this does not bring the player closer to the goal position (1, 3) in an efficient manner. The correct approach is to find a path that moves horizontally or vertically towards the goal without immediately resorting to diagonal movements when a more direct path is available.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the maze layout and the movement options
First, we need to understand the layout of the maze, including the positions of the walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in eight directions: up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals. We must avoid walls and only move to empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position at (1, 1), we look at the empty spaces to determine possible moves. The empty spaces are at (2, 2), (3, 1), and (3, 3).

## Step 3: Evaluate which move brings us closer to the goal
To reach the goal position (1, 3), we need to find a move that helps us make progress towards it. Moving directly to (1, 3) is not possible as there is a wall at (1, 2). The most direct approach would be to move as close as possible to the goal without being blocked by a wall.

## Step 4: Choose the best next move
Considering the available options and the fact that we are trying to get closer to (1, 3), the best next move would be to move down to (3, 1), which is the closest empty space that brings us in line with the x-coordinate of the goal.

## Step 5: Update the current position
Once we moved to (3, 1), we update the maze to reflect this new position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "Diagonal Line with a Branch".

To generate a new maze that meets the criteria, here is a new maze with the same size and a path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, forming a similar shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, and the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a diagonal line with a branch, which is similar to the original maze. The path from P to G can be reached through empty spaces, and the maze is not an identical copy of the original.
