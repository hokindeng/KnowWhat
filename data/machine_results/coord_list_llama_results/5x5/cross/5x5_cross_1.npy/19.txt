You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will analyze the given information and plan a step-by-step path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Given the player position is at (1, 1) and the goal is at (1, 3), and considering the positions of the walls and empty spaces, the most direct path would involve moving right towards the goal. However, there's a wall at (1, 2) blocking the direct path.

The closest empty space to the player that moves towards the goal, considering diagonal and orthogonal movements, is (2, 2). This space is not directly blocked by walls from the player's current position and offers a potential path towards the goal by navigating around the wall at (1, 2).

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state and the player's current position at (2, 2), the goal is still at (1, 3). Since the direct path to the goal is blocked by a wall at (1, 2) and now also by the wall at (2, 3) for a potential rightward move, I need to find an alternative route.

The closest empty space that could potentially lead to the goal, considering the constraints, is (3, 3). Moving to this position does not directly approach the goal but sets up for a potential diagonal or orthogonal move in the next step that could bring the player closer to the goal by navigating around the blocking walls.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state and the player's current position at (3, 3), the goal is still at (1, 3). Since the player is now positioned to potentially move towards the goal, considering diagonal movements are allowed, a direct diagonal move towards the goal would be the most efficient.

However, there's a wall at (2, 3) that blocks a direct diagonal path to the goal. But, noticing the empty space at (2, 2), a diagonal move to this position could set up for a subsequent move closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state and the player's current position at (2, 2), the goal is still at (1, 3). Since the player is now closer to the goal but still blocked by the wall at (1, 2) for a direct leftward move and the wall at (2, 3) for a direct upward move, a diagonal move towards the goal is the best option.

Considering the empty space at (1, 1) is not directly helpful for reaching the goal, and the goal itself is just one position up and to the left of the current position, but blocked by walls for direct movement, the most direct path considering diagonal movement would actually involve moving to the goal position directly if it were not for the rules of movement through empty spaces.

However, upon reevaluation, given the diagonal movement capability and the current position at (2, 2), the goal at (1, 3) is actually within a diagonal move's reach. The presence of walls directly above and to the left doesn't restrict a diagonal move to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be directly to the goal at (1, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze appears to be a diagonal or a zigzag line, but given the limited number of empty spaces, it's more accurately described as a simple diagonal line with a slight deviation. However, if we were to generalize the shape considering the path taken from the start to the goal, it could be seen as forming a rough "Z" shape or a zigzag pattern due to the diagonal and orthogonal moves required to navigate through the maze.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag or "Z" shape. The maze is encoded in the same format as the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 2)

This new maze maintains the same size as the original and includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G) through the empty spaces, forming a zigzag or "Z" shape. It is not an identical copy of the original maze but retains the same general shape formed by its empty spaces.
