You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation:

My current position is (1, 1) and I need to reach (1, 3). I have three possible moves: up, down, or right. Since moving up would put me into a wall, and moving left is not an option, I'll consider moving right or down.

If I move right, I would end up at (1, 2), which is a wall.

If I move down, I would end up at (2, 1), which is also a wall.

However, if I move diagonally down-right to (2, 2), I would end up in an empty space, which is a valid move.

My next move will be to (2, 2).

Please update the maze with my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation:

My current position is (2, 2) and I need to reach (1, 3). I have eight possible moves: up, down, left, right, and four diagonals. Since moving left or down would put me into a wall, and moving right is also not an option, I'll consider moving up or diagonally up.

If I move up, I would end up at (1, 2), which is a wall.

If I move diagonally up-left to (1, 1), I would end up in an empty space, which is a valid move. However, this move would not bring me closer to the goal.

If I move diagonally up-right to (1, 3), I would end up directly at the goal, which is the best possible outcome.

My next move will be to (1, 3).

Please let me know if this move is correct and if I have solved the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L" shape.

The corridors form an L shape, which connects the starting position to the goal position.

Here is a new maze that meets the specified criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze (5x5) and includes a valid path from the player position (1, 1) to the goal position (3, 3) that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is still an L shape. The maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it maintains the same shape of the corridors.
