You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The walls are denoted by coordinates, and the empty spaces are also given. The player starts at position (1, 1), and the goal is to reach (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the current position
From the current position (1, 1), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the best next move
Looking at the maze, we see that the goal position (1, 3) is to the right of the current position. However, there is a wall at (1, 2), so we cannot move directly to the right. We need to find an alternative path.

## Step 4: Find the best next move
Considering the possible moves, we can move down to (2, 1), but that would lead us further away from the goal. We can also move diagonally to (2, 2), which is an empty space. This move would bring us closer to the goal and potentially create a path to the right.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Re-evaluate the maze layout after the previous move
The maze layout has changed with the player now at position (2, 2). The goal remains at (1, 3), and the empty spaces have been updated.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the new current position
From the current position (2, 2), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, while avoiding walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the best next move
Given the goal position (1, 3) is diagonally up and to the right of the current position, but there is a wall at (1, 2) and (2, 3), we cannot move directly to the goal. We need to find a path around the walls.

## Step 4: Find the best next move
Considering the possible moves, moving up to (1, 2) is blocked by a wall. Moving right to (2, 3) is also blocked by a wall. However, moving diagonally up and left to (1, 1) is a valid move to an empty space. This move does not directly approach the goal but sets up for a potential next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Re-evaluate the maze layout after the previous move
The maze layout has the player back at position (1, 1). The goal remains at (1, 3), and the empty spaces are unchanged.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the new current position
From the current position (1, 1), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, while avoiding walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the best next move
Given the goal position (1, 3) is to the right of the current position, but there is a wall at (1, 2), we cannot move directly to the right. We need to find a path around the wall.

## Step 4: Find the best next move
Considering the possible moves, moving down to (2, 1) is blocked by a wall. However, moving diagonally down and right to (2, 2) is a valid move to an empty space. This move sets up for a potential next move towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

## Step 4: Find the best next move
Considering the possible moves, moving up to (1, 2) is blocked by a wall. Moving right to (2, 3) is also blocked by a wall. However, moving diagonally down and left to (3, 1) is a valid move to an empty space. This move does not directly approach the goal but sets up for a potential next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze form a diagonal or zigzag shape, but more generally, it can be described as a "staircase" shape.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same size and shape of empty spaces
To create a new maze with the same size and staircase shape of empty spaces, we need to rearrange the walls and empty spaces while maintaining a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Create the new maze
Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 2)

The final answer is: 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 2)
