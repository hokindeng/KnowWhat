You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 3.
The original solution suggests moving diagonally to (3, 3). However, this overlooks a more direct and efficient approach by not considering all adjacent positions thoroughly, particularly not evaluating the potential of moving right to (1, 2) before deciding on a diagonal move. Since the goal is at (1, 3), moving right first would actually position the player closer to the goal without the need for a diagonal move.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Evaluate the current player position and the goal position.
The player is currently at (1, 1) and needs to get to (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify the empty spaces around the current player position.
Given the empty spaces are (2, 2), (3, 1), and (3, 3), we can see that none of these are directly adjacent to the player. However, since diagonal moves are allowed, we should also consider positions that could potentially lead us closer to the goal with the least amount of moves.

## Step 3: Identify the most direct path to the goal considering the constraints.
Given the constraint that the player can only move through empty spaces, and the goal is at (1, 3), it's clear the direct path would be to move right, but first, we need to determine if moving right is feasible by checking if there are walls in the way. The position directly to the right (1, 2) is a wall, and so is moving up or down directly from (1, 1). This suggests we actually cannot move right directly to (1, 2) as initially intuited.

## Step 4: Consider a diagonal or alternative move.
Given the direct path to the right is blocked by a wall at (1, 2), a diagonal move seems the best option, as initially concluded but for sharper reasoning. Since (3, 1) and (3, 3) are both empty and diagonal moves are allowed, moving diagonally down and right to (3, 3) is indeed the correct approach, as it bypasses the wall and moves towards the goal in the fewest steps possible.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the evaluation.
The next move should indeed diagonally down and right to (3, 3) but with the correction in reasoning that it's after ruling out a direct move to the right, understanding the wall's placement, and accurately determining this as the best path considering the maze's constraints.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original problem doesn't require a step-by-step solution but rather asks for identifying the shape formed by the empty spaces in the given maze and creating a new maze of the same size where the empty spaces form the same shape.


# Correct Solution

## Part 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces.
Given the empty spaces are (2, 2), (3, 1), and (3, 3), if we plot these on a grid, we can see they somewhat resemble a diagonal line with a slight deviation, but in a very general and broad interpretation, one might describe the shape as a "diagonal line" with some liberties taken for the deviation. However, given the strict interpretation of shapes and the requirement for precision in describing geometric forms, it's more accurate to say the shape doesn't neatly fit a simple geometric description like a line, square, triangle, etc., but for the sake of this exercise, we could loosely describe it as forming a "broken diagonal."

## Part 2: Create a new maze of the same size with the same shape formed by empty spaces.
To create a new maze of the same size (5x5) with a similar "broken diagonal" shape, we can assign new wall and empty space positions while ensuring the maze isn't an identical copy and maintains a valid path from P to G.

New Maze:

- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4)
- Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)
- Player position: (1, 1)
- Goal: (3, 3)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a straight line (hence can be more accurately described) but maintains the essence of connecting from one part of the maze to another in a somewhat diagonal manner (given the P and G positions), thus aligning with the spirit of forming a path through empty spaces albeit with a more straightforward geometric interpretation.

However, since the task requires maintaining the original description for the sake of continuity, it's acknowledged that the interpretation of the shape remains as initially broadly categorized, even though the new example does not have the exact same complexity in its "diagonal" configuration.

New Maze in the required format but adhering strictly to the instruction without deviating into explanations within the format:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

The final answer is:

This response doesn't fit the requested format for providing the answer in a box since the question asks for a descriptive name of the shape and a new maze configuration, not a numerical answer.
