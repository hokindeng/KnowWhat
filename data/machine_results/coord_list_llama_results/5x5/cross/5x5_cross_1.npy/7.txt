You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 3.
The original solution suggests moving diagonally to (3, 3). However, this ignores a closer and more direct path through (2, 2), which is an available empty space adjacent to the current player position (1, 1), albeit diagonally.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal
The player's current position is at (1, 1), and the goal is to reach (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the current position
From (1, 1), considering the constraints of the maze, the player can move to the following empty spaces: (2, 2).

## Step 3: Determine the best move
Among the possible moves, the best option is to move to (2, 2), as it brings the player closer to the goal and does not move away from the goal's column unnecessarily.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal
The player's current position is at (2, 2), and the goal is to reach (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the current position
From (2, 2), considering the constraints of the maze, the player can move to the following empty spaces: (1, 1), (3, 1), or (3, 3).

## Step 3: Determine the best move
Among the possible moves, moving to (1, 1) would backtrack, and moving to (3, 3) would move away from the goal's column. The best option is to move to (3, 1), as it sets up a potential path to the goal while minimizing backtracking.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal
The player's current position is at (3, 1), and the goal is to reach (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the current position

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze form a diagonal shape that can be described as a "staircase" or "zig-zag" pattern, but more generally, it's a diagonal line connecting the empty spaces.


## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same size and shape of empty spaces
To create a new maze with the same size and a similar diagonal shape of empty spaces, we need to redefine the positions of the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal.


## Step 3: Define the new maze
New maze:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (3, 2), (1, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (1, 2)


The final answer is: (1) diagonal line, 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (3, 2), (1, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (1, 2)
