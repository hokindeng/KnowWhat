You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the challenge.


After analyzing the maze, I believe my next move should be to (2, 2), which is an empty space adjacent to my current position.


So, my next move is: (2, 2)


Please update the maze and let me know the result!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (2, 2), I see that I can move to (3, 1), (3, 3), or try to get closer to the goal by moving to (1, 1).


However, moving to (1, 1) would take me further away from the goal, and moving to (3, 3) doesn't seem to provide any immediate advantage.


Therefore, I decide to move to (3, 1).


So, my next move is: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 1), I want to move closer to the goal. I notice that there's an empty space at (3, 3), which is adjacent to my current position.


Moving to (3, 3) seems like a good option, as it brings me closer to the goal without putting me in a position where I'm blocked by walls.


So, my next move is: (3, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Fun task!


(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a **diagonal line**.


(2) Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same diagonal line shape:


Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 3)

This new maze has the same diagonal line shape formed by the empty spaces, but the path is in a different position and orientation than the original maze.
