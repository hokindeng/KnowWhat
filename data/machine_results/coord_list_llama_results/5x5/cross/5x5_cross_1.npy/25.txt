You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the challenge.


After analyzing the maze, I realize that I can move from the player position (1, 1) to the adjacent empty space (2, 2) or (1, 0) is a wall, (1, 2) is a wall.


However, I can also move to (3, 1), another adjacent empty space.


Since my goal is (1, 3), I will choose to move to (2, 2), as it is closer to the goal.


So, my next move is: (2, 2).


Please update the maze accordingly, and I'll plan my next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I can see that I've moved to (2, 2).


Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that (3, 1), (3, 3) are available, as well as the previous player position (1, 1).


However, since my goal is (1, 3), I want to try to get closer to it.


I can see that I can move to (1, 1) which is a good strategic move, because then I can attempt to move up (but this is blocked) or attempt to move right and reach the goal.


My next move is: (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at (1, 1), my goal is still (1, 3), which is just two spaces to the right.


However, I can see that (1, 2) is a wall, so I won't be able to move directly to the goal.


But I can try to go around the wall by moving diagonally or moving down and then right.


Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that (3, 1), (2, 2), and (3, 3) are available.


Since my goal is (1, 3), I want to try to get closer to it.


I can move to (2, 2), but I was already there before, and it didn't bring me closer to the goal.


But moving to (3, 1) won't bring me closer either.


So I will choose (3, 3) because then I might be able to find a diagonal path to the goal.


However I can simply try to move to the right anyway since that is where the goal is.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would say that:


(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces is an "L-shape" or a "corner shape", since the empty spaces are located in a way that forms a corner or an L-shape.


(2) Here's a new maze with the same size, with empty spaces that form an L-shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)


This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from the player position to the goal that can be reached through the empty spaces. The general shape formed by the empty spaces is also an L-shape.
