You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The current player position is at (1, 1) and the goal position is at (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From the current player position (1, 1), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze
Looking at the maze, we can see that the only possible move from the current player position (1, 1) is to move right to (1, 2) or down to (2, 1) or diagonally to (2, 2). However, (1, 2) is a wall, and (2, 1) is also a wall.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
The only possible move is to move diagonally to (2, 2), which is an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
The maze is still a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The current player position is now at (2, 2) and the goal position is still at (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From the current player position (2, 2), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze
Looking at the maze, we can see that the only possible move from the current player position (2, 2) is to move up to (1, 2), but it's a wall, or move left to (2, 1), but it's also a wall, or move right to (2, 3), but it's a wall, or move down to (3, 2), but it's a wall. However, we can move diagonally to (1, 1) or (3, 1) or (3, 3).

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since moving diagonally to (1, 1) would move us away from the goal, we should move to either (3, 1) or (3, 3). However, moving to (3, 3) would put us in a better position to reach the goal in the next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
The maze is still a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The current player position is now at (3, 3) and the goal position is still at (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From the current player position (3, 3), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze
Looking at the maze, we can see that the only possible move from the current player position (3, 3) that brings us closer to the goal is to move up to (2, 3), but it's a wall. However, we can move diagonally to (2, 2).

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since moving diagonally to (2, 2) is the only move that brings us closer to the goal, we should move to (2, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
The maze is still a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The current player position is now at (2, 2) and the goal position is still at (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From the current player position (2, 2), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze
Looking at the maze, we can see that the only possible move from the current player position (2, 2) that brings us closer to the goal is to move up and to the right to (1, 3), but since we can't move through walls, we can move diagonally up and to the left to (1, 1).

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since moving diagonally to (1, 1) is the only move that brings us closer to the goal, we should move to (1, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
The maze is still a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The current player position is now at (1, 1) and the goal position is still at (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From the current player position (1, 1), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze
Looking at the maze, we can see that the goal position (1, 3) is to the right of the current player position (1, 1). However, there is a wall at (1, 2) that blocks the direct path.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since we can't move directly to the goal, we need to find an alternative path. We can move diagonally to (2, 2), which is an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
The maze is still a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The current player position is now at (2, 2) and the goal position is still at (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From the current player position (2, 2), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze
Looking at the maze, we can see that the goal position (1, 3) is to the up and right of the current player position (2, 2). However, there is a wall at (2, 3) that blocks the direct path to the right, and a wall at (1, 2) that blocks the direct path up.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since we can't move directly to the goal, we need to find an alternative path. We can move diagonally up and to the left to (1, 1), but that would move us away from the goal. However, we can try to move up to (1, 2) but it's a wall, or we can try to move right to (2, 3) but it's also a wall. The only possible move that brings us closer to the goal is not available.

## Step 5: Re-evaluate the maze
Upon re-evaluation, we can see that the goal is actually blocked by walls and the only way to reach it is to move diagonally from a position that is not blocked by walls.

## Step 6: Choose an alternative move
We can move diagonally up and to the left to (1, 1), and then try to find an alternative path to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
The maze is still a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The current player position is now at (1, 1) and the goal position is still at (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves

## Step 3: Analyze the maze
Looking at the maze, we can see that the goal position (1, 3) is to the right of the current player position (1, 1). However, there is a wall at (1, 2) that blocks the direct path.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since we can't move directly to the goal, we need to find an alternative path. We can move diagonally to (2, 2), which is an empty space.

## Step 5: Plan the next moves
From (2, 2), we can move diagonally to (1, 3), which is the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "Diagonal Line" or a "Staircase" shape, but more specifically, it can be described as a "Disjointed Diagonal" or a "Broken Diagonal" since it's not a perfect diagonal line.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same shape
To generate a new maze with the same shape, we need to create a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces that form a disjointed diagonal shape.

## Step 3: Create the new maze
Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 2)

The final answer is: 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 2)
