You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The current player position is at (1, 1) and the goal position is at (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From the current player position (1, 1), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze
Looking at the maze, we can see that the only possible move from the current player position (1, 1) is to move right to (1, 2) or down to (2, 1) or diagonally to (2, 2). However, (1, 2) is a wall, and (2, 1) is also a wall.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
The only possible move is to move diagonally to (2, 2), which is an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
The maze is still a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The current player position is now at (2, 2) and the goal position is still at (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From the current player position (2, 2), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze
Looking at the maze, we can see that the only possible move from the current player position (2, 2) is to move up to (1, 2), but it's a wall, or move down to (3, 2), but it's also a wall, or move left to (2, 1), but it's a wall, or move right to (2, 3), but it's a wall, or move diagonally to (1, 1), which is an empty space, or move diagonally to (3, 1), which is also an empty space, or move diagonally to (3, 3), which is an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since moving diagonally to (1, 1) would move us away from the goal, we should move diagonally to (3, 1) or (3, 3). However, moving to (3, 1) would also move us away from the goal. Therefore, the best move is to move diagonally to (3, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
The maze is still a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The current player position is now at (3, 3) and the goal position is still at (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From the current player position (3, 3), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze
Looking at the maze, we can see that the only possible move from the current player position (3, 3) is to move up to (2, 3), but it's a wall, or move down to (4, 3), but it's a wall, or move left to (3, 2), but it's a wall, or move right to (3, 4), but it's a wall, or move diagonally to (2, 2), which is an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since moving diagonally to (2, 2) is the only possible move that doesn't involve moving into a wall, we should move diagonally to (2, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
The maze is still a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The current player position is now at (2, 2) and the goal position is still at (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From the current player position (2, 2), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze
Looking at the maze, we can see that the only possible move from the current player position (2, 2) is to move up to (1, 2), but it's a wall, or move down to (3, 2), but it's a wall, or move left to (2, 1), but it's a wall, or move right to (2, 3), but it's a wall, or move diagonally to (1, 1), which is an empty space, or move diagonally to (3, 1), which is an empty space, or move diagonally to (3, 3), which is an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since moving diagonally to (1, 1) would move us closer to the goal, we should move diagonally to (1, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
The maze is still a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The current player position is now at (1, 1) and the goal position is still at (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From the current player position (1, 1), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze
Looking at the maze, we can see that the only possible move from the current player position (1, 1) is to move right to (1, 2), but it's a wall, or move down to (2, 1), but it's a wall, or move diagonally to (2, 2), which is an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
However, we can also see that the goal position (1, 3) is just two spaces to the right of our current position. We can't move directly to the goal because of the wall at (1, 2), but if we could get past that wall, we could reach the goal.

## Step 5: Re-evaluate possible moves
Given the proximity of the goal, we should try to move closer to it. Since we can't move directly to the goal, we should try to move to a position that would allow us to move closer to the goal on our next turn.

## Step 6: Choose the next move
In this case, our best option is to move diagonally to (2, 2), which would put us in a position to potentially move closer to the goal on our next turn.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
The maze is still a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The current player position is now at (2, 2) and the goal position is still at (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From the current player position (2, 2), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze
Looking at the maze, we can see that the only possible move from the current player position (2, 2) is to move diagonally to (1, 1), which is an empty space, or move diagonally to (3, 1), which is an empty space, or move diagonally to (3, 3), which is an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
However, we can also see that the goal position (1, 3) is just one space up and one space right of our current position. We can't move directly to the goal because of the wall at (2, 3) and (1, 2), but if we could get past those walls, we could reach the goal.

## Step 5: Re-evaluate possible moves
Given the proximity of the goal, we should try to move closer to it. Since we can't move directly to the goal, we should try to move to a position that would allow us to move closer to the goal on our next turn.

## Step 6: Choose the next move
In this case, our best option is to move diagonally to (1, 1), which would put us in a position to potentially move closer to the goal on our next turn.

## Step 7: Alternative move
However, moving diagonally to (1, 1) would put us in a position we've already been in. Instead, we could try moving diagonally to (3, 3) and see if we can find an alternative path to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
The maze is still a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The current player position is now at (3, 3) and the goal position is still at (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From the current player position (3, 3), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze
Looking at the maze, we can see that the only possible move from the current player position (3, 3) is to move diagonally to (2, 2), which is an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since moving diagonally to (2, 2) is the only possible move that doesn't involve moving into a wall, we should move diagonally to (2, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
The maze is still a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The current player position is now at (2, 2) and the goal position is still at (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From the current player position (2, 2), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze
Looking at the maze, we can see that the only possible move from the current player position (2, 2) is to move diagonally to (1, 1), which is an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since moving diagonally to (1, 1) is the only possible move that doesn't involve moving into a wall, we should move diagonally to (1, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
The maze is still a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The current player position is now at (1, 1) and the goal position is still at (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From the current player position (1, 1), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze
Looking at the maze, we can see that the goal position (1, 3) is just two spaces to the right of our current position. However, there is a wall at (1, 2) that blocks our path.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Unfortunately, there is no possible move that can take us closer to the goal without going through a wall or an already visited space.

## Step 5: Re-evaluate the maze
Upon re-evaluation, we realize that we have explored all possible paths and there is no way to reach the goal without going through a wall.

## Step 6: Admit defeat
We must admit that the maze is unsolvable from the current position.

However, I must provide a move. In this case, I will choose to move to a previously visited space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "Disconnected Diagonal".

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same shape
To generate a new maze with the same shape, we need to create a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces that form a Disconnected Diagonal shape.

## Step 3: Create the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (2, 3)

The final answer is: 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (2, 3)
