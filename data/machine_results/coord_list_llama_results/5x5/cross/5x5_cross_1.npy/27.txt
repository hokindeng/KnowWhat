You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will analyze the given information and plan a step-by-step path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Given the player position is at (1, 1) and the goal is at (1, 3), and considering the positions of the walls and empty spaces, the most direct path would involve moving right towards the goal. However, there's a wall at (1, 2) blocking the direct path.

The closest empty space to the player that moves towards the goal, considering diagonal and orthogonal movements, is (2, 2). This space is one step diagonally down and to the right from the player's current position.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the player's new position at (2, 2), the goal remains at (1, 3). Since the direct path up to the goal is blocked by a wall at (1, 2) and (2, 1) is also a wall, I need to find an alternative route.

Considering the available empty spaces, moving to (3, 1) does not bring me closer to the goal in a meaningful way, and moving to (3, 3) could potentially offer a path back towards the goal through a future move.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the player's new position at (3, 3), the goal remains at (1, 3). Since I am now at the same y-coordinate as the goal, I should aim to move directly towards it, which means going up.

However, there's a wall at (2, 3) blocking the direct path up. Considering diagonal movements, I can move diagonally up and to the left to get closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 2), as it is the closest empty space that moves me in the direction of the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the player's new position at (2, 2), the goal remains at (1, 3). Since I am now closer to the goal, I should aim to move directly towards it.

Considering the available empty spaces and the walls, I can move diagonally up and to the left to get closer to the goal, but I would end up at (1, 1) which is not the goal. However, from (1, 1) I could potentially move right to the goal if I can get past the wall at (1, 2).

Since I have no other options to move closer to the goal, my next move would be to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the player's new position at (1, 1), the goal remains at (1, 3). Since I am now at the same x-coordinate as the goal, I should aim to move directly towards it, which means going right.

However, there's a wall at (1, 2) blocking the direct path right. But I can move right to the goal if I can get past this wall, which I can do by moving to the goal directly since it is adjacent to my current position and the wall at (1, 2) does not block a diagonal move to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 3), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "Z" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a "Z" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form a "Z" shape, similar to the original maze.
