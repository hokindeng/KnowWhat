You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution suggests moving diagonally to (3, 3). However, this overlooks the possibility of moving directly down from (1, 1) to (2, 1), which is not an empty space but also not allowed because it's a wall. Then it overlooks the possibility of moving down from (1, 1) to (2, 2) directly, which is allowed and is closer to the goal in terms of the number of steps needed to reconsider the path to the goal.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1:  Assess the current position and the goal.
The player is at position (1, 1) and needs to get to (1, 3). The direct path is blocked by walls, so a detour is necessary.

## Step 2:  Evaluate possible moves from the current position.
From (1, 1), possible moves are to adjacent empty spaces. The closest empty spaces are at (2, 2), (3, 1), and (3, 3).

## Step 3:  Identify the best immediate move.
The most straightforward move is to go down from (1, 1) to (2, 2), removing the thought of going to (3, 1) or (3, 3) immediately because (2, 2) is closer.

## Step 4:  Confirm the chosen path does not contain walls.
By moving down to (2, 2), we are not directly hitting a wall, so this move is allowed.

## Step 5:  Execute the move.
The next move is to the position (2, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
This is a new turn in the maze.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1:  Assess the current position and the goal.
The player is at position (2, 2) and needs to get to (1, 3). The path needs to be found through available empty spaces.

## Step 2:  Evaluate possible moves from the current position.
From (2, 2), possible moves are to adjacent empty spaces. However, given the current position, a direct move up and to the right is needed but blocked by a wall, so the only viable options are to move down or to move left and up.

## Step 3:  Identify the best immediate move.
Given the constraints, a logical move is to go up and around or directly to an empty space that is closer to the goal. The closest empty space that makes sense is at (1, 1), then move to (1,3) if possible or go to (3, 1) or (3, 3) as alternatives.

## Step 4:  Choose the most direct path to the goal from the alternatives.
Moving up directly is not possible because it hits a wall. However, moving diagonally up-left to (1, 1) is the closest move that is directly closer to the goal that is feasible in terms of distance.

## Step 5:  Execute the move.
The next move is to the position (1, 1), but the goal is closer if the path is open; if not, go for (3, 1) or (3, 3).

## Step 6: Check if the path directly to the goal is open.
Since the path from (1, 1) directly to (1, 3) is evaluated and found open from (1, 1), the immediate next step from the original current position of (1, 1) suggested previously could be skipped with this assessment and elaborate that the best path is found to be to move up-left then move up-right.

## Step 7: Elaborate the best alternative
Since we already know the end goal to reach, once in (1,1), the direct path for the next move should be directly to (1,3), so the elaboration from assessment was to go directly to (1, 3).

## Step 8: Confirm that move and allocate back the original step.
Based on position

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
This is an analysis task based on the previous maze.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1:  Determine the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Given the coordinates of the empty spaces in the original maze: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), we can observe that they form a diagonal or a bent line from one side of the maze to the other, passing through or around the center. However, since there are not enough points, the most we can say is it forms a diagonal line or a possible "L" shape when considering the path from the player's position to the goal.

## Step 2:  Create a new maze that meets the specified criteria with the same size (5x5) and a valid path from P to G, ensuring it's not an identical copy but retains the same general shape of the corridors.
To maintain the shape and criteria, the new maze should have a similar diagonal or "L" pattern of empty spaces, but with adjustments to ensure the maze is not identical.

## Step 3:  Design the new maze.
We can achieve this by altering the positions of the empty spaces while keeping the diagonal or "L" feature and making sure there is a valid path from the player's new position to the goal.

## Step 4:  Encode the new maze in the same format as the original.
After designing the new maze layout, we'll represent it using the same format of listing the coordinates of walls, empty spaces, the player's position, and the goal position.

## Step 5:  Ensure the new maze meets all specified criteria.
The new maze must be of the same size (5x5), include a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, not be an identical copy of the original maze, and retain the "diagonal" or "bent line" shape.

## Step 6: Present the final Maze.

Given the instructions, a new maze should be similar in structure to this but ensuring it keeps the properties mentioned.


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 3)


The final answer is: $\boxed{diagonal or L}$
