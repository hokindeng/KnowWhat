You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze is a 5x5 grid with walls and empty spaces. The walls are denoted by coordinates, and the empty spaces are also given. The player starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach the goal at (1, 3).

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the current position
From the player's current position (1, 1), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the best next move
Looking at the maze, we see that moving directly to the goal (1, 3) is blocked by a wall at (1, 2). We need to find an alternative route. The closest empty space to the player's current position is (2, 2), which is diagonally up and to the right.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Given the constraints of the maze and the goal, the best next move is to (2, 2). This move gets us closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Re-evaluate the maze after the previous move
The player is now at (2, 2), and the goal remains at (1, 3). We need to find a way to get closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the new position
From (2, 2), we can consider moving up, down, left, right, or diagonally. However, we must avoid walls and consider the empty spaces.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze for the best next move
Given the new position, moving directly to the goal is still not possible due to the wall at (1, 2). However, we can move diagonally down and to the left to (1, 1), which is now an empty space, or we can move to (3, 1) or (3, 3). But the most efficient move to get closer to the goal would be to move to (1, 1) and then try to find a way to the goal from there.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the options, the best next move is to (1, 1). This move gets us closer to the goal and sets up for a potential next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Re-evaluate the maze after the previous move
The player is now back at (1, 1), and the goal remains at (1, 3). We need to find a way to get closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the new position
From (1, 1), we can consider moving up, down, left, right, or diagonally. However, we must avoid walls and consider the empty spaces.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze for the best next move
Given the new position, moving directly to the goal is still not possible due to the wall at (1, 2). However, we can move diagonally up and to the right to (2, 2), which is an empty space we've been to before, or we can try to find another route. Since moving to (2, 2) doesn't get us closer to the goal directly and we've already explored that path, we need to consider other options.

## Step 4: Explore alternative routes
Considering the maze layout, an alternative route could involve moving down to (3, 1), which is an empty space, and then trying to find a way to the goal from there.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the constraints and the goal, the best next move is to (3, 1). This move starts a new path that could potentially lead to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze form a diagonal or a zigzag pattern, but given the limited number of empty spaces and their positioning, it's more accurate to describe the shape as a diagonal line with a slight deviation, which doesn't perfectly fit a simple geometric shape like a straight line, L-shape, or a more complex shape like a zigzag. However, for simplicity and given the constraints, we might consider it closest to a diagonal line with an extension or a slight zigzag.

## Step 2: Determine the specific shape name
Given the complexity and the unique arrangement of the empty spaces, it's challenging to assign a simple geometric shape name. However, for the purpose of this exercise, let's consider it a form of a zigzag or a diagonal with a deviation, acknowledging that it's a simplification.

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same size and a similar shape for the empty spaces
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it's the same size (5x5), includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and the empty spaces form a similar zigzag or diagonal shape.

## Step 4: Design the new maze
The new maze will have walls and empty spaces rearranged to form a zigzag or diagonal path from P to G, while maintaining the same size and a non-identical layout.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze
Here is the new maze encoded in the same format as the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

The final answer is: 
For (1), the shape is a form of a zigzag or diagonal.
For (2), the new maze is encoded above.
