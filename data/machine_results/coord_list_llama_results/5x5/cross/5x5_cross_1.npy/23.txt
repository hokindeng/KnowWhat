You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)
Adjacent empty spaces: (2, 2), (3, 1)

Since I can move diagonally, I will consider all eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, and four diagonals). However, I will prioritize the moves that bring me closer to the goal.

My next move will be to (2, 2), as it is the closest empty space to the goal and allows me to move diagonally towards the goal.

Next move: (2, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2, 2), I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)
Adjacent empty spaces: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)

Since my goal is to reach (1, 3), I will try to move closer to it. However, there is a wall at (1, 2) that blocks my direct path. I will try to find an alternative route.

My next move will be to (3, 3), as it is the closest empty space that allows me to potentially move around the wall and get closer to the goal.

Next move: (3, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3, 3), I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)
Adjacent empty spaces: (2, 2), (3, 1)

Since my goal is to reach (1, 3), I will try to move closer to it. I notice that I can move diagonally to (2, 2), which brings me closer to the goal.

My next move will be to (2, 2), as it is the closest empty space that allows me to move closer to the goal.

Next move: (2, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at position (2, 2), I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)
Adjacent empty spaces: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)

Since my goal is to reach (1, 3), I will try to move closer to it. I notice that I can move to (1, 1), which is the closest empty space to the goal.

My next move will be to (1, 1), as it is the closest empty space that allows me to move closer to the goal.

Next move: (1, 1)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1, 1), I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)
Adjacent empty spaces: None directly adjacent, but (2, 2) is diagonally adjacent.

However, I notice that the goal (1, 3) is only two spaces away from my current position, and there are no walls between my current position and the goal, except for the fact that I need to move around the wall at (1, 2).

My next move will be to (2, 2), as it is the closest empty space that allows me to move around the wall and get closer to the goal.

Next move: (2, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.



However, I can see that after this move, I can move to the goal (1, 3) on the next turn.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Z-shape" or a "zigzag".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar Z-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a Z-shape that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape and structure.
