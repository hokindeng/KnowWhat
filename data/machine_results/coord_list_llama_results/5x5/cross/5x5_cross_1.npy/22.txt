You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution suggests moving diagonally to (3, 3). However, this does not bring the player closer to the goal position (1, 3) in an efficient manner. The correct approach is to find a path that moves horizontally or vertically towards the goal without immediately resorting to diagonal movements when a more direct path is available.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the maze layout and the movement options
First, we need to understand the layout of the maze, including the positions of the walls, empty spaces, the player's current position, and the goal position. The player can move in eight directions: up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals, but only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current position
Given the player's current position at (1, 1), we need to find the adjacent empty spaces. However, since the maze structure and the positions of empty spaces and walls are given, we should look for a direct path to the goal if possible.

## Step 3: Look for a direct path to the goal if possible
The goal is located at (1, 3), which is to the right of our current position. We need to check if there is a direct horizontal path or a viable alternative route to the goal.

## Step 4: Find the best next move
Upon reviewing the maze again, notice there is an empty space directly above the player's current position at (2, 2) or diagonally at (3, 1). However, since the goal is directly to the right and there's a wall at (1, 2), the direct path is blocked. Therefore, we need to find an alternative route. Moving directly up to (2, 2) places us in a position closer to exploring a path around the walls on the left or using a diagonal. However, looking closely, a feasible move is to move diagonally to (3, 1) because from there, we could explore options to move closer to the goal on the next turn.

## Step 5: Choose the move that progresses towards the goal
Considering the options of moving up to (2, 2) or diagonally to (3, 1), moving diagonally to (3, 1) keeps us closer to the goal's column and could open up a path to navigate around walls or move diagonally towards the goal.

## Step 6: Identify the closest move to the goal from the options
After reevaluating the possible moves and the maze structure, we aim to move closer to the goal position without running into a wall, making the diagonal move to (3, 1) a logical step to explore further options.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "Diagonal Line".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (3, 3), (1, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (2, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G) through the empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is still recognizable as a "Diagonal Line", but the maze is not an identical copy of the original.
