You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation:

My current position is (1, 1) and I need to reach (1, 3). I notice that there is a wall directly to my right, at (1, 2). However, there is an empty space diagonally up-right, which is not an option since I would have to cross the wall at (1, 2).

The only feasible move is to go down to the empty space at (3, 1) or move diagonally down-right to the empty space at (3, 3). However, moving diagonally down-right would put me farther away from the goal.

So, my next move would be to move down to the empty space at (3, 1). This would put me at position (3, 1), and I would reassess my options from there.

Next move: (3, 1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "Inverted L" shape or an "L" shape with a missing corner.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "Inverted L" shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 2), (1, 2)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (2, 3)


This maze is not identical to the original, but still has the same "Inverted L" shape, with the corridors that can connect the player position to the goal.
