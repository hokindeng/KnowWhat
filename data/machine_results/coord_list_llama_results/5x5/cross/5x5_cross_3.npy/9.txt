You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the challenge.


After analyzing the maze, I will make my next move. Since the goal position is at (4, 1), I will try to get closer to it while avoiding the walls.


My next move will be to the position (3, 2), which is an empty space adjacent to my current position (2, 1).


Please update the maze with my new position (3, 2).


Next move: (3, 2)


Let me know if this is a valid move and present the updated maze for my next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the updated maze.


From my current position (3, 2), I can move to (2, 1), which is an empty space adjacent to me. However, this would be moving away from the goal. I'll look for a better option.


Another possibility is moving to (4, 3), which is also an empty space. But I'd rather try to get closer to the goal (4, 1) if possible.


After re-evaluating, I found that I can actually move to (4, 1) directly from my current position (3, 2), which is the goal!


However, I noticed that (4, 1) is not listed as an empty space. I'll assume it's not a wall either since it's marked as the goal. I'll take the risk.


My next move will be to the position (4, 1), the goal.


Please update the maze with my new position (4, 1) or let me know if I've reached the goal.


Next move: (4, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors)**


The empty spaces in the original maze form a general shape that can be described as a "**Staircase**" or a "**Diagonal Line**".


**2. A new maze with the same general shape**


Here's a new maze with the same size as the original, where the empty spaces form a staircase shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)


Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original, and the staircase shape formed by the empty spaces is still recognizable. The player can navigate from the starting position (1, 2) to the goal position (4, 1) by moving through the empty spaces.
