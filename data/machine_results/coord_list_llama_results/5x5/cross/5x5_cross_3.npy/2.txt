You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only valid move from the player's starting position (2, 1) is to move up to (1, 1). However, upon re-examining the maze, we realize that moving up to (1, 1) is incorrect because (1, 1) is actually a wall. The correct approach is to examine all possible adjacent positions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) and choose the one that is both in the "Empty" list and is a feasible move given the maze's constraints.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the layout of the maze
The maze is described by the coordinates of its walls, empty spaces, the current player position, and the goal position. The walls and empty spaces define the structure of the maze, while the player and goal positions give us the start and end points for navigation.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the player's current position
Given that the player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal) to an adjacent empty space, we need to check all these directions from the player's current position (2, 1). This requires analyzing the empty spaces list for coordinates that are directly next to (2, 1) in any of the allowed directions.

## Step 3: Determine the adjacent empty spaces
Analyzing the moves:
- Moving up: (1, 1) is a wall.
- Moving down: (3, 1) is a wall.
- Moving left: (2, 0) is a wall.
- Moving right: (2, 2) is a wall.
- Moving diagonally up-left: (1, 0) is a wall.
- Moving diagonally up-right: (1, 2) is a wall.
- Moving diagonally down-left: (3, 0) is a wall.
- Moving diagonally down-right: (3, 2) is empty.

## Step 4: Choose the valid move
The only valid move is diagonally down-right to (3, 2), which is in the list of empty spaces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
The maze layout has changed with the player's new position at (3, 2). The goal remains at (4, 1).

## Step 2: Reassess possible moves from the new player position
From (3, 2), we need to consider all eight directions again to find a path towards the goal that only moves through empty spaces.

## Step 3: Determine the adjacent empty spaces
Given the updated empty spaces list, we analyze each direction:
- Moving up: (2, 2) is a wall.
- Moving down: (4, 2) is a wall.
- Moving left: (3, 1) is a wall.
- Moving right: (3, 3) is a wall.
- Moving diagonally up-left: (2, 1) is empty.
- Moving diagonally up-right: (2, 3) is empty.
- Moving diagonally down-left: (4, 1) is the goal.
- Moving diagonally down-right: (4, 3) is empty.

## Step 4: Choose the valid move
We have three valid moves to empty spaces: diagonally up-left to (2, 1), diagonally up-right to (2, 3), and diagonally down-right to (4, 3). However, the most direct path to the goal is diagonally down-left to (4, 1), which directly reaches the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  1\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a diagonal line from (2, 1) to (4, 3) with a slight deviation to include (3, 2), generally resembling a diagonal line or a staircase.

## Step 2: Determine the name of the general shape
Given the diagonal and step-like nature of the empty spaces, the general shape can be referred to as a "staircase" or "diagonal staircase."

## Step 3: Create a new maze of the same size with the same shape of empty spaces
To create a new maze, we will shift the staircase shape to start from a different position but maintain its diagonal characteristic. The new maze must have the same dimensions (5x5) and include a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G) through empty spaces.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
New Maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

The final answer is: 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)
