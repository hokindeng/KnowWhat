You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 3.
The original solution suggests moving diagonally to (3, 2). However, this solution overlooks a more direct and less error-prone approach given the maze's configuration.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Evaluate the starting position.
The player starts at position (2, 1), and the goal is to reach (4, 1). The direct path involves moving rightwards, but we need to navigate around the walls and through the empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the starting position.
From (2, 1), considering the constraints of the maze, the player can move right or down. Moving right directly towards the goal is the most straightforward approach if possible.

## Step 3: Choose the move.
Since moving right from (2, 1) directly towards (4, 1) on the y-coordinate (1) is not immediately blocked by a wall and no wall is mentioned at (3, 1), the most direct move without creating unnecessary complexity is to move right towards (3, 1), assuming it's an empty space or can be considered as part of the path based on the game's rules of only moving through empty spaces or the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Looking at the coordinates of the empty spaces in the original maze: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3), it appears that they form a diagonal line with a slight deviation, resembling a simplified diagonal shape or a diagonal line with a single-step detour.

## Step 2: Determine the exact shape for clarity.
Given the simplicity and the orientation, we can more specifically describe this as a "diagonal line with a step" or more broadly as a "staircase" due to its step-like nature. However, the most fitting description considering the slight deviation might be a "broken diagonal" or simply a "diagonal" if we generalize the shape and consider the minor deviation as part of a broader diagonal path.

## Step 3: Create a new maze that meets the criteria.
To create a new maze with the same shape of empty spaces (a diagonal or broken diagonal), we need to define new wall and empty space coordinates. The maze should be a 5x5 grid, as implied by the coordinates of the original maze.

## Step 4: Define the new wall coordinates.
Let's start by defining where the walls will not be to ensure our diagonal path is clear, then fill in walls around it. The walls can be anywhere except where we want our diagonal or broken diagonal path.

## Step 5: Define the new empty space coordinates.
To maintain the diagonal shape and ensure it's recognizable, we can shift the diagonal one step to the right or left but maintain the same general direction. Let's place the empty spaces at (2, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4) to create a clear diagonal line.

## Step 6: Define the player position (P) and goal position (G).
Let's place the player at a position that requires navigation through the diagonal path, such as (2, 1), and the goal at the end of the diagonal path, such as (4, 4).

## Step 7: Provide the new maze.
- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
- Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)
- Player position: (2, 1)
- Goal: (4, 4)

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$
