You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the challenge.


After analyzing the maze, I will make my next move. Since the goal position is at (4, 1), I will try to get closer to it while avoiding the walls.


My next move will be to the position (3, 2), which is an empty space adjacent to my current position (2, 1).


Please update the maze with my new position (3, 2).


Next move: (3, 2)


Let me know if this is a valid move and present the updated maze for my next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the updated maze.


Since my current position is (3, 2), I can see that I need to move closer to the goal position (4, 1). However, there's a wall at (3, 1) that blocks my direct path.


My next move will be to the position (2, 1), which is now an empty space adjacent to my current position (3, 2). This move will allow me to explore alternative paths and hopefully get closer to the goal.


Next move: (2, 1)


Let me know if this is a valid move and present the updated maze for my next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (2, 1).


Let me reassess the situation. I can see that there's an empty space at (2, 3), which I can move to.


My next move will be to the position (2, 3), which will give me more space to explore and potentially find a path to the goal.


Next move: (2, 3)


Please update the maze with my new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Fun task!


(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is an "L-shape".


(2) Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 3)


In this new maze, the empty spaces form an L-shape, and there's a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G) through the empty spaces.


Let me know if this meets your requirements!
