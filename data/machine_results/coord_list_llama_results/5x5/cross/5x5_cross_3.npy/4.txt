You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution suggests moving diagonally to (3, 2). However, this solution is incomplete as it only provides one step towards the goal and doesn't consider the possibility of moving directly towards the goal if a path exists.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Determine the current player position and goal position
The current player position is given as (2, 1), and the goal position is given as (4, 1).

## Step 2: Identify the empty spaces adjacent to the current player position
The empty spaces are given as (2, 3), (3, 2), and (4, 3). However, we should also look for any empty spaces that are directly adjacent to the current player position in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally).

## Step 3: Analyze the maze and find the shortest path to the goal
Since we can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), we can potentially move closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the optimal move towards the goal
Upon re-evaluating the maze, it seems possible to move directly towards the goal by moving right and down instead of going through (3, 2).

## Step 5: Propose the next move based on the analysis
Considering the direct path towards the goal and the restrictions imposed by the walls and empty spaces, a better initial move would be to move right and down towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Determine the current player position and goal position
The current player position is given as (3, 2), and the goal position is given as (4, 1).

## Step 2: Identify the empty spaces adjacent to the current player position
The empty spaces are given as (2, 1), (2, 3), and (4, 3). However, since the goal is at (4, 1) and considering the ability to move diagonally, we need to find the best move towards the goal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze and find the shortest path to the goal
Given the current position and the goal, the shortest path involves moving diagonally towards the goal if possible, considering the restrictions imposed by the walls.

## Step 4: Choose the optimal move towards the goal
Given the player's current position at (3, 2) and the goal at (4, 1), moving diagonally down and left would bring the player closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

## Step 5: Propose the next move based on the analysis
The best move is to go diagonally towards the goal, but since going diagonally down and left from (3, 2) would attempted put us at the goal but still on the wall, we would instead look for the closest diagonal which is (4, 3) then going down would lead us to crash on a wall then we could to to the right and so we go one step further back which is (3, 3), but because that's a wall the best you could do in this scenario is going back.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
Upon examining the original maze, the empty spaces form a diagonal line from the top-right to the bottom-left. However, given the positioning of the player and the goal, the general shape of the empty spaces that form the path could be considered as a diagonal line.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a "Diagonal Line".

## Step 3: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same shape
To create a new maze, we will place the empty spaces in a way that they also form a diagonal line but with a different positioning within the maze.

## Step 4: Define the new maze
Let's create a new maze where the empty spaces form a diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right but avoid making it an identical copy of the original maze.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze
The new maze will have walls, empty spaces, a player position, and a goal position, similar to the original maze. We'll position the player at the top-left of the diagonal and the goal at the bottom-right. Given that we need to form a path similar to a diagonal and not similar to the given diagonal since the given diagonal is unique we would need to flip it, and because of that the player needs to be around (1, 0) and the goal (3, 4) to replicate the required diagonal, the path will go through (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), and (4, 3).

The final answer is: 

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)
