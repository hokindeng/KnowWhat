You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the challenge.

To solve this maze, I'll use a simple algorithm: I'll explore the available paths from the current position, prioritize the ones that bring me closer to the goal, and avoid walls.

Analyzing the maze, I see that my current position is (2, 1), and the goal is (4, 1). The wall at (2, 2) blocks my direct path to the goal, so I need to find an alternative route.

Considering the available empty spaces, I can move to:

* (2, 3): This space is two steps away from my current position, but it doesn't bring me closer to the goal.
* (3, 2): This space is diagonally adjacent to my current position and brings me closer to the goal.

I'll choose to move to (3, 2). This move gets me closer to the goal and opens up new possibilities for my next move.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (3, 2)

Please update the maze and let me know the new state.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (3, 2), I can move to:

* (2, 1): This space is diagonally adjacent to my current position, but moving back to this space would increase the distance to the goal.
* (2, 3): This space is diagonally adjacent to my current position, but it doesn't bring me closer to the goal.
* (4, 3): This space is diagonally adjacent to my current position, but moving there wouldn't get me closer to the goal directly. However, it's a possibility for the future.
* (4, 1): This is the goal position, but I'm blocked by the wall at (4, 2).

I need to find a way to get closer to the goal. Moving to (2, 1) or (2, 3) wouldn't help. However, I notice that if I move to (4, 3), I might be able to find a way to get closer to the goal from there.

So, I'll choose to move to (4, 3).

Please update the maze and let me know the new state.

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (4, 3), I can see that the goal (4, 1) is quite close, but there's a wall at (4, 2) blocking my way.

However, I can move to the empty space at (3, 2), and from there, I might be able to find a way to get closer to the goal.

So, I'll choose to move to (3, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 2)

Please update the maze and let me know the new state.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (3, 2)!

From this position, I can move to the empty space at (2, 3) or (2, 1), but neither of those would bring me closer to the goal.

However, I notice that if I move to (4, 3) again, I might be able to find a way to get closer to the goal from there. And indeed, from (4, 3), I could potentially move diagonally to the goal (4, 1).

But there's no direct path to the goal from my current position. I need to revisit my previous position (4, 3) and try to find an alternative path from there.

So, I'll choose to move to (4, 3) again.

However, wait a minute... I've been to (4, 3) before, and I came back to (3, 2). If I go back to (4, 3), I'll be stuck in an infinite loop.

Let me think... Ah, I have an idea! I'll move to (2, 1) and then try to find a path from there.

But, that wouldn't help.

Hmm... I think I need to rethink my strategy.

Finally, it occurred to me that I've been focusing too much on moving forward and not enough on analyzing the maze. Let me take a closer look at the maze.

After re-examining the maze, I realize that there's no way to reach the goal without going through a wall or revisiting previous positions indefinitely.

However, in this case I'll try the following:

I will try (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (4, 3), I can try to move to the goal (4, 1). However, the wall at (4, 2) blocks my direct path.

Unfortunately, I don't have any other options that would bring me closer to the goal. In this case, I must conclude that the maze is unsolvable, or the solution requires a different approach or additional information.

But I will make one last attempt. I'll move to (3, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems I'm back at (3, 2) again.

From this position, I don't see any moves that would bring me closer to the goal (4, 1) without revisiting previous positions. However, I'll make one last attempt.

I notice that the wall at (4, 2) is the main obstacle blocking my path to the goal. Unfortunately, I don't have any information about the maze that would allow me to remove or bypass the wall.

After re-examining the maze, I realized that I made a mistake in my previous attempts. I was too focused on moving forward and didn't consider the limitations of the maze.

In this case, I must conclude that the maze is indeed unsolvable, given the provided constraints and rules.

I won't provide another move, as I believe it would be futile. The maze appears to be designed to trap the player in an infinite loop or block their progress to the goal.

If I'm correct, I'd love to know more about the maze's design and whether there's a solution that I overlooked.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After re-examining the original maze, I notice that the empty spaces (corridors) form a shape that resembles a diagonal or zig-zag line. However, if I had to give a more specific name, I would say that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is similar to a "Z" or "staircase" shape.

To answer your request, I will provide a new maze with the same size and a valid path from P to G, but with different wall and empty space configurations.

Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and its empty spaces form a shape that resembles a "Z" or "staircase" shape. However, it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
