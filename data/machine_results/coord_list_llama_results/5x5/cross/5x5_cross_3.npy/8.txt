You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

From the player's current position (2, 1), I can move in the following directions:

* Up: Not possible (wall at (1, 1))
* Down: Possible, but it would put me at (3, 1), which is also a wall.
* Left: Not possible (wall at (2, 0))
* Right: Possible, it would put me at (2, 2), but it's also a wall.
* Diagonal up-left: Not possible (wall at (1, 0))
* Diagonal up-right: Not possible (wall at (1, 2))
* Diagonal down-left: Not possible (wall at (3, 0))
* Diagonal down-right: Possible, it would put me at (3, 2), which is an empty space.

Considering the available options, I will move diagonally down-right to (3, 2).

Next move coordinates: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

From the player's current position (3, 2), I can move in the following directions:

* Up: Possible, it would put me at (2, 2), but it's a wall.
* Down: Possible, it would put me at (4, 2), but it's also a wall.
* Left: Possible, it would put me at (3, 1), but it's a wall.
* Right: Possible, it would put me at (3, 3), but it's also a wall.
* Diagonal up-left: Possible, it would put me at (2, 1), which is an empty space.
* Diagonal up-right: Not possible (wall at (2, 4) and (2, 3) has wall at (2, 4) adjacent and also I will still be diagonally away from the goal)
* Diagonal down-left: Possible, it would put me at (4, 1), which is the goal.
* Diagonal down-right: Not possible (wall at (4, 4) and out of boundary concern with respect to goal)

Considering the available options, since my primary objective is to reach the goal position, I will prioritize the option that takes me closest to the goal.

Next move coordinates: (4, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A "Diagonal Staircase" or " Zig-Zag Staircase"

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original, and forms a diagonally staggered staircase shape with its corridors.
