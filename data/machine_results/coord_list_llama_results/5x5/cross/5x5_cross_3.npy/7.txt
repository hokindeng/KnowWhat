You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

From the player's current position (2, 1), I can move in the following directions:

* Up: blocked by wall (1, 1)
* Down: blocked by wall (3, 1)
* Left: blocked by wall (2, 0)
* Right: empty space (2, 3) and (3, 2)
* Diagonally: empty space (3, 2)

I choose to move diagonally to the position (3, 2), as it brings me closer to the goal position (4, 1).

Next move: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

From the player's current position (3, 2), I can move in the following directions:

* Up: blocked by wall (2, 2)
* Down: blocked by wall (4, 2)
* Left: blocked by wall (3, 1)
* Right: empty space (4, 3)
* Diagonally: empty space (2, 1) and goal position is reachable if I go in the other diagonal direction, down and left

However, moving diagonally down and left would put me directly at the goal position (4, 1).

I choose to move diagonally to the position (4, 1), as it brings me directly to the goal.

Next move: (4, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L" shape

The corridors form an L shape, allowing the player to navigate from the starting position to the goal position.

Here is a new maze with the same size as the original, with empty spaces that form the same L shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

This new maze meets the criteria, as it:

* Has the same size as the original maze (5x5)
* Includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* Is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L shape.
