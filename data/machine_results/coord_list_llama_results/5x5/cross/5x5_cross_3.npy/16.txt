You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the challenge.

To solve this maze, I'll use a simple algorithm: I'll explore the available paths from the current position, prioritize the ones that bring me closer to the goal, and avoid walls.

Analyzing the maze, I see that my current position is (2, 1), and the goal is (4, 1). The wall at (2, 2) blocks my direct path to the goal, so I need to find an alternative route.

Considering the available empty spaces, I can move to:

* (2, 3): This space is two steps away from my current position, but it doesn't bring me closer to the goal.
* (3, 2): This space is diagonally adjacent to my current position and brings me closer to the goal.

I'll choose to move to (3, 2). This move gets me closer to the goal and opens up new possibilities for my next move.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (3, 2)

Please update the maze and let me know the new state.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my new position at (3, 2), I see that I'm closer to the goal, but I'm still blocked by a wall.

Considering the available empty spaces, I can move to:

* (2, 1): This space is diagonally adjacent to my current position, but it would move me further away from the goal.
* (2, 3): This space is diagonally adjacent to my current position, but it doesn't bring me closer to the goal.
* (4, 3): This space is diagonally adjacent to my current position and is on the same row as the goal, but one column to the right.

However, I notice that moving to (4, 3) could potentially allow me to move down to the goal (4, 1) on my next turn, if I can find a way to navigate around the wall at (4, 2).

I'll choose to move to (4, 3). This move gets me closer to the goal row and sets me up for a potential next move to the goal.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (4, 3)

Please update the maze and let me know the new state.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (4, 3), which is one column to the right of the goal.

To reach the goal, I need to move left, but the wall at (4, 2) blocks my path. However, I can move diagonally to an empty space that gets me closer to the goal.

I notice that I can move to (3, 2), which is diagonally adjacent to my current position. From there, I can reassess the situation and plan my next move.

I'll choose to move to (3, 2). This move gets me closer to the goal and opens up new possibilities for my next move.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (3, 2)

Please update the maze and let me know the new state.



 edited next move in anticipation of being asked for subsequent moves after the described move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Déjà vu! I'm back at (3, 2).

Considering the available empty spaces, I notice that I can move to:

* (2, 1): This space is diagonally adjacent to my current position, but it would move me further away from the goal.
* (2, 3): This space is diagonally adjacent to my current position, but it doesn't bring me closer to the goal.
* (4, 3): I've already been to this space, and I know it's a dead-end for reaching the goal directly.

However, I also notice that I can move down to (4, 1) directly from my current position (3, 2) by moving diagonally down-right. This would be a bold move, as it would avoid the wall at (4, 2) and land me directly at the goal.

I'll choose to move to (4, 1). This move gets me directly to the goal and solves the maze.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (4, 1)

Please let me know if I've successfully solved the maze!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Fun challenge!

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a diagonal "Staircase" shape, specifically a right-handed staircase from top-left to bottom-right, then a single downward step to the goal.

(2) Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (1, 2), (3, 2), (2, 3), (4, 1)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and its empty spaces form a Diagonal Staircase shape.
