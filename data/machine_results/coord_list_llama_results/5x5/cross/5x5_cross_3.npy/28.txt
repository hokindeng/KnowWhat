You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution suggests moving diagonally to (3, 2). However, this solution is incomplete as it only provides one step towards the goal and doesn't consider the possibility of moving directly towards the goal if a path exists.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Determine the current player position and goal position
The current player position is given as (2, 1), and the goal position is given as (4, 1).

## Step 2: Identify the empty spaces adjacent to the current player position
The empty spaces are given as (2, 3), (3, 2), and (4, 3). However, we should also look for any empty spaces that are directly adjacent to the current player position in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally).

## Step 3: Analyze the maze and find the shortest path to the goal
Since we can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), we can potentially move closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the optimal move towards the goal
Upon re-evaluating the maze, it seems possible to move directly towards the goal by moving right and down instead of going through (3, 2).

## Step 5: Propose the next move based on the analysis
Considering the direct path towards the goal and the restrictions imposed by the walls and empty spaces, a better initial move would be to move right and down towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Determine the current player position and goal position
The current player position is given as (3, 2), and the goal position is given as (4, 1).

## Step 2: Identify the empty spaces adjacent to the current player position
The empty spaces are given as (2, 1), (2, 3), and (4, 3).

## Step 3: Analyze the maze and find the shortest path to the goal
We need to move down and left to reach the goal. Since we can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal), we can potentially move closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the optimal move towards the goal
Considering the direct path towards the goal and the restrictions imposed by the walls and empty spaces, the optimal move is to move down and left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Wait, I think I made a mistake! I'm not at the goal position yet.

We need to move left to reach the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the optimal move towards the goal
Considering the direct path towards the goal and the restrictions imposed by the walls and empty spaces, the optimal move is to move left to (4, 2), but it is a wall. We should move up and left to reach an empty space and get closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Propose the next move based on the analysis
Considering the restrictions, the best move would be to move up and left.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The empty spaces in the original maze form a diagonal path from (2, 3) to (4, 1). Therefore, the general shape formed by the empty spaces is a diagonal line.


## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same shape
To create a new maze of the same size, we need to define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position.


## Step 3: Define the walls
Let's create a new set of walls that will form a maze of the same size. We can define the walls as follows:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3)


## Step 4: Define the empty spaces
We want the empty spaces to form a diagonal line, so let's define them as follows:
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0)


## Step 5: Define the player position and goal position
Let's place the player at the start of the diagonal path and the goal at the end. However, we need to adjust the positions slightly to fit the new maze.
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 0)


The final answer is: 

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 0)
