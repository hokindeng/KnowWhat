You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution suggests moving diagonally to (4, 3). However, this solution overlooks a more direct path and doesn't consider the implications of moving diagonally. Given the constraints and the layout of the maze, we should aim to move as directly as possible towards the goal while avoiding walls. Moving diagonally to (4, 3) would not be the most efficient step towards reaching the goal directly.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the maze layout to understand the positions of the walls, empty spaces, the player, and the goal.
The maze has walls blocking direct paths, with specific empty spaces that allow movement. The player starts at (2, 1), and the goal is at (4, 1).

## Step 2: Identify possible paths from the player position to the goal.
Considering the maze's layout, we need to find a sequence of empty spaces that allows us to move from (2, 1) to (4, 1) without hitting a wall. Since the goal is at (4, 1), and the direct horizontal path is blocked by walls at (3, 1) and potentially at (4, 0) which blocks the way straight to the goal, we must navigate through the available empty spaces to find an alternative route.

## Step 3: Determine the immediate next move.
Given the direct path to the goal is blocked and considering the position of the player and the available empty spaces, we can move to (3, 2), which is one of the empty spaces and presents a potential path towards the goal by avoiding the wall at (3, 1).

## Step 4: Reassess after considering the best immediate next move.
Upon reassessment, given the restrictions and aiming for efficiency in reaching the goal directly, the optimal next step is not a diagonal move as previously hinted but to navigate towards (3, 2). This reassessment demonstrates a more focused approach to navigating the maze, prioritizing directness and the potential for future moves that more efficiently lead to the goal.

## Step 5: Finalize the next move based on the analysis.
After analyzing the maze and considering the path towards the goal, the best next move from the current player position (2, 1) is to (3, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and possible moves from (3, 2).
From the position (3, 2), we need to find a move that gets us closer to the goal (4, 1) while avoiding walls. The direct path to the goal is blocked by a wall at (3, 1) and the edge of the maze at (4, 0).

## Step 2: Identify the available empty spaces near the player's position.
We have empty spaces at (2, 1), (2, 3), and (4, 3). However, since we are trying to get to (4, 1), we need to find a move that will either bring us closer to the goal or position us for a subsequent move that could.

## Step 3: Determine the best move based on the current layout and goal.
Moving back to (2, 1) would increase the distance from the goal. Moving to (2, 3) might provide an alternative path but seems counterintuitive for reaching (4, 1). Therefore, moving to (4, 3) becomes the most logical step as it positions the player closer to the goal vertically and provides a potential path to move horizontally towards the goal, depending on the maze's layout and rules about moving along edges.

## Step 4: Reaffirm the decision based on the goal and current position.
Considering the aim to reach (4, 1), and given the restrictions in place, the optimal next move is indeed towards (4, 3), setting up for a potential final move closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Evaluate the current position and available moves.
The player is at (4, 3), and the goal is to reach (4, 1). We need to find a path that avoids walls and moves closer to the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the adjacent empty spaces or potential moves.
Considering the current position, the direct move towards the goal would be going down to (4, 1), but we need to ensure there are no walls in between.

## Step 3: Analyze the feasibility of moving directly towards the goal.
Given the goal is at (4, 1) and the player is at (4, 3), moving directly down would indeed bring the player to the goal, provided there are no restrictions or walls in that specific path within the maze's rules.

## Step 4: Confirm the decision to move towards the goal.
Upon reviewing the maze's layout and the positions, moving from (4, 3) to (4, 1) appears to be a direct and logical step towards reaching the goal, as it does not contradict any provided rules about movement within the maze.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  1\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Based on the coordinates of the empty spaces in the original maze, (2, 3), (3, 2), and (4, 3), it can be observed that these points form a diagonal line or a zig-zag pattern that connects the player's position to the goal. However, considering the overall path from the start to the goal, including the necessary navigation around walls, the shape can be more accurately described as forming a zig-zag or an 'L' shape due to the movement required to navigate from the start to the goal around the maze's walls.

## Step 2: Determine the correct description of the shape.
Given the constraints of the maze and the necessary movement path, describing the shape as a "zig-zag" might be misleading since it implies more turns than necessary. Therefore, the shape can be more accurately described as an "L-shape" when considering the direct path from the player's starting position to the goal, taking into account the navigation around the walls of the maze.

## Step 3: Generate a new maze that meets the specified criteria.
The new maze must have the same size (5x5), include a valid path from the player to the goal, not be an identical copy of the original maze, and have its empty spaces form an "L-shape".

## Step 4: Define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal for the new maze.
For the new maze, let's define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal as follows:
- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
- Empty spaces: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
- Player position: (1, 4)
- Goal: (3, 2)

## Step 5: Ensure the new maze meets all the requirements.
The new maze is of the same size, has a valid path from the player to the goal through the empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original, and its empty spaces form an "L-shape", adhering to all the specified criteria.

The final answer is:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 2)

Shape: L-shape
