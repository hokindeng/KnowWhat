You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 3.
The original solution suggests moving diagonally to (3, 2). However, this solution overlooks a more direct and feasible move to (2, 3), which is an adjacent empty space. This move keeps the player closer to the outer edge of the maze and sets up a potential path to the goal.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the rules for movement.
The maze is a 5x5 grid with specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's position, and the goal. The player can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 2: Identify the player's current position and the goal position.
The player is currently at (2, 1), and the goal is to reach (4, 1).

## Step 3: Determine the possible moves from the current position.
From (2, 1), the player can move up to (1, 1) but it's blocked by a wall, down to (3, 1) but it's also blocked, left to (2, 0) which is blocked, or right to (2, 2) which is blocked but also down and right diagonally to (3, 2) or just right to (2, 3) which is an empty space. Moving diagonally up and right is not an option because it is out of the maze bounds, and diagonally up and left is also not possible due to being out of bounds. Moving down and left or up and left diagonally is also not an option due to being out of bounds or blocked.

## Step 4: Choose the best move.
Given the options, the best move is to (2, 3), which is directly adjacent to the current position and allows for the potential to move towards the edge of the maze, ultimately aiming for the goal.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original problem doesn't provide a solution to critique. It asks to identify the shape formed by the empty spaces in the maze and then to create a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the original maze to identify the shape formed by the empty spaces.
The empty spaces are at coordinates (2, 3), (3, 2), and (4, 3). By examining the layout, the shape resembles a diagonal line from top-right to bottom-left.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces.
Given the diagonal arrangement of the empty spaces, the general shape can be described as a "diagonal line" or more simply as "diagonal".

## Step 3: Create a new maze of the same size (5x5) with a valid path from P to G that is not identical to the original maze but maintains the same diagonal shape.
To create a new maze, we need to place the player (P) and the goal (G) in positions where a diagonal path can be formed without directly copying the original maze.

## Step 4: Define the new maze's walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position.
Considering the constraints, a possible new maze could have the following configuration:

- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
- Empty: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 4)
- Player position: (1, 2)
- Goal: (3, 4)

This maze maintains the diagonal shape of the empty spaces and provides a new path from P to G.


The final answer is: $\boxed{diagonal}$
