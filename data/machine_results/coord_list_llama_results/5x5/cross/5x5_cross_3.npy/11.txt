You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 3.
The original solution suggests moving diagonally to (3, 2). However, this solution is incomplete as it does not continue to find the path to the goal position. Also, it does not consider all possible moves from the current position.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the maze
First, we need to understand the layout of the maze. The walls and empty spaces are given, and we know our current player position (P) is at (2, 1) and the goal position (G) is at (4, 1). We need to find a path from P to G through the empty spaces.

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves
From the player's current position (2, 1), we can look at the adjacent positions (including diagonals) that are empty and not blocked by walls. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. We must check which of these positions are empty.

## Step 3: Choose the next move
Based on the layout of the maze and the goal position (G) at (4, 1), our next move should ideally bring us closer to the goal. Since the direct path to the left is blocked by a wall, we look for an alternative. A diagonal move to (3, 2) is possible because (3, 2) is an empty space.

## Step 4: Subsequent moves
After reaching (3, 2), we need to continue moving towards the goal. Since we can move diagonally, up, down, left, or right, our next move should be closer to the goal. The goal is at (4, 1), which means moving down to (4, 2) will not bring us closer, but moving diagonally down-left to (4, 1) directly achieves the objective.

## Step 5: Consideration of previous mistake
The new step corrects the oversight of not continuing to find the path to the goal and considers all possible moves, including diagonal ones, to reach the goal efficiently.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original problem was correctly solved.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces
After re-examining the maze, we can observe that the empty spaces form a diagonal line from top-right to bottom-left.


## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces also form a diagonal line, but not necessarily in the same positions as the original maze.


## Step 3: Determine the walls and empty spaces for the new maze
Since the original maze has a size of 5x5, our new maze will also have the same size. We will place the empty spaces in a diagonal line from top-right to bottom-left, but shifted one position to the right compared to the original maze.


## Step 4: Define the new maze
New maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Note that this new maze meets the criteria of having the same size, a valid path from P to G, not being an identical copy, and forming a diagonal shape with its empty spaces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A diagonal line}$
