You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

From the current player position (2, 1), I can move in the following directions:

- Up: (1, 1) is a wall.
- Down: (3, 1) is a wall.
- Left: (2, 0) is a wall.
- Right: (2, 2) is a wall.
- Up-left: (1, 0) is a wall.
- Up-right: (1, 2) is a wall.
- Down-left: (3, 0) is a wall.
- Down-right: (3, 2) is an empty space.

My next move is to the down-right, to the empty space at coordinates (3, 2).

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (3, 2).

I can move in the following directions:

- Up: (2, 2) is a wall.
- Down: (4, 2) is a wall.
- Left: (3, 1) is a wall.
- Right: (3, 3) is a wall.
- Up-left: (2, 1) is an empty space.
- Up-right: (2, 3) is an empty space.
- Down-left: (4, 1) is the goal, but it is not adjacent to an empty space to allow a diagonal move.
- Down-right: (4, 3) is an empty space.

Since the goal position is not directly accessible, I will move to an empty space that might bring me closer to the goal. I will move to the down-right, to the empty space at coordinates (4, 3).

However, upon re-examining the possible moves, I notice that moving up-right to (2, 3) would not bring me closer to the goal. Moving up-left to (2, 1) also would not make progress towards the goal. Therefore, moving down-right to (4, 3) is the most promising option.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (4, 3).

I can move in the following directions:

- Up: (3, 3) is a wall.
- Down: Not possible, as I am already at the bottom edge of the maze.
- Left: (4, 2) is a wall.
- Right: (4, 4) is a wall.
- Up-left: (3, 2) is an empty space.
- Up-right: Not a viable option, as it would lead to a wall.
- Down-left: Not possible, as I am already at the bottom edge of the maze.
- Down-right: Not possible, as I am already at the bottom edge of the maze and there is a wall to the right.

Since the goal position (4, 1) is two spaces to the left of my current position, I will try to move closer to it by moving up-left to the empty space at coordinates (3, 2).

However, I notice that moving up-left would put me in a position where I would still need to overcome the wall at (4, 2) or (3, 1) to reach the goal. I would essentially be back-tracking, as I was previously at (3, 2) two moves ago.

A better approach is to try to find an alternative route. Considering the available empty spaces, I notice that I have already visited or excluded most options. Since I am close to the goal, I should focus on finding a direct path to it.

Upon closer inspection, I notice that moving directly to the goal (4, 1) would require traversing a wall, which is not possible. However, I also notice that I can move diagonally to a position adjacent to the goal if there were an empty space available.

In this maze, however, I don't see other options for my next move that would bring me significantly closer to the goal without back-tracking or hitting walls.

Wait! I realize now that moving to (3, 2) would actually be a strategic move towards accessing the goal position indirectly. Given the walls and my movement options, back-tracking in this case could be justified.

So, the coordinates of my next move are indeed: (3, 2).

If I move there, my next move will likely require visiting (2, 1) to ultimately progress closer to the goal. I'll further reflect on this path if I reach (2, 1) as expected after making this current move to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've been here before! Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (3, 2).

I can move in the following directions:

- Up: (2, 2) is a wall.
- Down: (4, 2) is a wall.
- Left: (3, 1) is a wall.
- Right: (3, 3) is a wall.
- Up-left: (2, 1) is an empty space.
- Up-right: (2, 3) is an empty space.
- Down-left: (4, 1) is the goal, but it is not adjacent to an empty space to allow a diagonal move.
- Down-right: (4, 3) is an empty space, but I was just there, and moving back would not progress me towards the goal.

As I anticipated in my previous move, I will now move to the up-left, to the empty space at coordinates (2, 1).

This move may seem like back-tracking, but it is a deliberate strategy to attempt to find an alternative route to the goal.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (2, 1). I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position.

I can move in the following directions:

- Up: (1, 1) is a wall.
- Down: (3, 1) is a wall.
- Left: (2, 0) is a wall.
- Right: (2, 2) is a wall.
- Up-left: (1, 0) is a wall.
- Up-right: (1, 2) is a wall.
- Down-left: Not a viable option, as (3, 1) is a wall.
- Down-right: (3, 2) is an empty space.

Given that I am trying to reach the goal (4, 1), moving to the down-right to (3, 2) would bring me closer to a position where I might find an opportunity to progress towards the goal.

However, I've already been to (3, 2) twice before, and I know the limited options available from there. Nevertheless, considering the alternative, which would be staying at (2, 1) or moving to a walled-off area, moving down-right is the better option.

So, the coordinates of my next move are indeed: (3, 2).

But wait, what's the point of moving there? I've been there before, and I back-tracked from there to get here.

I take a moment to reconsider... Then, it hits me. I will be moving in circles if I go back to (3, 2).

Considering the repetitions and the restrictions imposed by the walls, it's starting to look like there's no viable solution to this maze problem under the constraints given.

As I think more about it, I'm fairly certain the maze has no solvable path under the defined constraints. There are a limited number of moves I could make initially, but eventually, those moves take me to no further subsequent valid outcomes or closer proximity to the defined goal.

Thus, instead of choosing to input another set of movement coordinates as a potential guess, I'm determined now that this is a well-fashioned problem at which making only repetitious rather circular pursuits of the path to embark toward goal success under constraints appears practically founded impossible as probed according to variables.

In summary, after analyzing the maze and exploring the possible moves, I have determined that there is no viable solution to reach the goal (4, 1) from the initial player position (2, 1) under the given constraints. The maze appears to be designed in a way that creates a circular path, making it impossible to progress towards the goal without repeating previous moves.

Well, that was a fun challenge! If you'd like to provide another maze or modify the existing one to create a solvable path, I'd be happy to give it another try.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

What a great follow-up question!

(1) After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "disconnected triangle" or more specifically, a " fragmented triangle with isolated nodes".

However, upon closer inspection, I realize that the shape is best described as a "fragmented line with a detached node". This description more accurately reflects the linear arrangement of the empty spaces with a separate, isolated node.

(2) Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

This maze has a similar size to the original and features a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a "fragmented line".


Wait, can I modify the maze so that it meets the criteria of having the same shape (a "fragmented line with a detached node")?

Here is the updated maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3), (2, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1 -> moved to (4, 3))
