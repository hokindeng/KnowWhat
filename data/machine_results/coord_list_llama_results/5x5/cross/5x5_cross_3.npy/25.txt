You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only valid move from the player's starting position (2, 1) is to move up to (1, 1). However, upon re-examining the maze, we realize that moving up to (1, 1) is incorrect because (1, 1) is actually a wall, not an empty space.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current player position, the goal position, and the possible moves.
The player is currently at position (2, 1), and the goal is to reach position (4, 1). The possible moves from any position are up, down, left, right, and any diagonal direction, provided the destination is an empty space.

## Step 2: Examine the empty spaces and walls to determine a path to the goal.
The empty spaces are at (2, 3), (3, 2), and (4, 3). To reach the goal (4, 1), we must navigate through these spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 3: Consider each possible move from the current position (2, 1).
Moving left to (1, 1) is not valid because (1, 1) is a wall. Moving up to (1, 1) is also not valid for the same reason. Moving right to (2, 2) is not valid because (2, 2) is a wall. Moving down to (3, 1) is not valid because (3, 1) is a wall. Moving diagonally up-left to (1, 0) or up-right to (1, 2) is not valid because both are walls. Moving diagonally down-left to (3, 0) or down-right to (3, 2) could be valid if it leads to an eventual path to the goal, but moving to (3, 0) is not valid because it is a wall.

## Step 4: Given the constraints, we realize the only valid move from the player's current position (2, 1) to an adjacent empty space is moving diagonally down-right to (3, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original solution was a good first step, but we'll continue to solve this problem step-by-step.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current player position, the goal position, and the possible moves.
The player is currently at position (3, 2), and the goal is to reach position (4, 1). The possible moves from any position are up, down, left, right, and any diagonal direction, provided the destination is an empty space.

## Step 2: Examine the empty spaces and walls to determine a path to the goal.
The empty spaces are at (2, 1), (2, 3), and (4, 3). To reach the goal (4, 1), we must navigate through these spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 3: Consider each possible move from the current position (3, 2).
Moving left to (2, 2) is not valid because (2, 2) is a wall. Moving up to (2, 2) is also not valid for the same reason. Moving right to (4, 2) is not valid because (4, 2) is a wall. Moving down to (4, 2) is also not valid for the same reason. Moving diagonally up-left to (2, 1) could be valid if it leads to an eventual path to the goal. Moving diagonally down-right to (4, 3) could also be valid if it leads to an eventual path to the goal.

## Step 4: Given the constraints, we realize that moving diagonally up-left to (2, 1) does not lead to a path to the goal. However, moving diagonally down-right to (4, 3) can potentially lead to a solution.

## Step 5: Now that we've moved to an empty space at (4, 3), there's a clear valid move down to (4, 1) on the next step which reaches the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "staircase" or "zig-zag" shape.


Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same staircase shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)


This new maze has the same size as the original and features a staircase-shaped path from the player's starting position (1, 2) to the goal position (4, 1). While it's not an identical copy of the original maze, the general shape formed by its empty spaces remains a staircase.
