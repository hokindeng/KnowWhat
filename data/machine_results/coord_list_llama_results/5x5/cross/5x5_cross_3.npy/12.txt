You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move. Based on the current player position (2, 1) and the available empty spaces, my next move will be to the position (3, 2).

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (3, 2).

Please update the maze with my new position and let me know the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (3, 2), I'll plan my next move. I'll aim to get closer to the goal position (4, 1). Since the direct path to the goal is blocked by a wall, I'll try to move to a position that can potentially lead me to the goal.

My next move will be to the position (2, 3).

However, I realize that moving to (2, 3) might not be the most optimal move. Since I'm already at (3, 2) and the goal is at (4, 1), I should try to get closer to the goal.

Wait, I have a better idea! I can move to (4, 3) instead, which is closer to the goal and can potentially lead me to the goal position.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (4, 3).

Please update the maze with my new position and let me know the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (4, 3), I'll aim to get closer to the goal position (4, 1). Since the goal is on the same row, I can try to move horizontally towards it.

Unfortunately, there's a wall at (4, 2) that's blocking my direct path to the goal. However, I can move diagonally to (3, 2), which can potentially lead me to the goal.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (3, 2).

Please update the maze with my new position and let me know the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back to a familiar position!

From my current position (3, 2), I can see that the direct path to the goal (4, 1) is still blocked by a wall. However, I notice that I can move diagonally to the goal.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (4, 1).

This move will take me directly to the goal position, and I'll be done with the maze!

Please confirm if I'm correct and let me know the final outcome!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Fun task!

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a diagonal zig-zag or a zig-zag staircase.

(2) Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)


This new maze has the same 5x5 size as the original and features a diagonal zig-zag path from the player position to the goal. The empty spaces (corridors) form the same general shape as the original maze, but with a different layout.

Feel free to try solving this new maze if you'd like!
