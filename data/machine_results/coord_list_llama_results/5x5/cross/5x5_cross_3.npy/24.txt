You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we'll use a step-by-step approach considering the given constraints. The objective is to move from the current player position (2, 1) to the goal position (4, 1), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

Given the player's current position at (2, 1) and the available empty spaces at (2, 3), (3, 2), and (4, 3), we need to find the best possible move that brings us closer to the goal (4, 1).

Since diagonal moves are allowed, we should consider all eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) from the current position. However, given the constraints of the maze and the available empty spaces, our next move should aim to get closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

The closest empty space that is also in a beneficial direction towards the goal would be (3, 2). Moving to (3, 2) positions us closer to the goal while avoiding the walls. It also potentially sets us up for a move directly towards the goal or towards (4, 3), which are both in the vicinity of the goal position.

Therefore, the coordinates of the next move should be **(3, 2)**. This move is chosen based on the given constraints and the goal to navigate through the maze efficiently.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Considering the updated maze and the new player position at (3, 2), we need to determine the next move. The goal remains the same: reach the goal position (4, 1) by moving through empty spaces and avoiding walls.

Given the current position (3, 2), the available empty spaces are (2, 1), (2, 3), and (4, 3). To move closer to the goal (4, 1), the best available option is to move towards the x-coordinate of the goal, which is 4. However, moving directly to x=4 at the current y-coordinate (2) is blocked by a wall at (4, 2).

The most viable next move, considering the need to progress towards the goal while avoiding walls and staying within the bounds of the maze, is to move diagonally down and right towards (4, 3). This position is in the general direction of the goal and opens up possibilities for further moves towards the goal, given the constraints of the maze.

Therefore, the coordinates of the next move should be **(4, 3)**. This move aligns with the strategy to reach the goal position (4, 1) while adhering to the rules of movement within the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the maze is a **"Diagonal stair"** or can be more broadly classified under a **"Staircase"** shape, as the empty spaces are structured in a way that resembles steps, facilitating movement in a diagonal direction down and then potentially horizontally towards the goal.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5), with empty spaces forming a similar "Staircase" shape, specifically facilitating a diagonal and then horizontal path:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

This maze maintains the same size as the original, includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G) that can be navigated through the empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and its empty spaces form a recognizable "Staircase" shape.
