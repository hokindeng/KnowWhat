You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. Since I can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or any diagonal) to an adjacent empty space, I will consider all possible moves from the current player position (2, 1).

The possible moves are:

* Up: Not allowed, as (1, 1) is a wall.
* Down: Not allowed, as (3, 1) is a wall.
* Left: Not allowed, as (2, 0) is a wall.
* Right: Possible, as (2, 3) is an empty space, but I can also consider moving diagonally.
* Diagonal (up-right): Not allowed, as (1, 2) is a wall.
* Diagonal (down-right): Possible, as (3, 2) is an empty space.
* Diagonal (down-left): Not allowed, as (3, 0) is a wall.

Considering all possible moves, I will choose to move diagonally down-right to (3, 2), as it seems to bring me closer to the goal.

My next move is to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze again from my new position (3, 2).

The possible moves are:

* Up: Not allowed, as (2, 2) is a wall.
* Down: Not allowed, as (4, 2) is a wall.
* Left: Possible, as (3, 1) is not an empty space but could be considered if it was the goal (which it is not, but adjacent to it), (2, 2) is a wall and (2, 1) and (3, 1) do not align with our current movement options. Left can be considered in relation to the goal.
* Right: Possible, as (3, 3) is not an empty space,  (3, 3) is  blocked. However there is an empty space at (2, 3) (2 steps from our current player position)  and another at (4, 3).
* Diagonal (up-left): Possible, as (2, 1) is an empty space.
* Diagonal (up-right): Possible, as (2, 3) is an empty space.
* Diagonal (down-left): Not possible and blocked (4, 1) could be our goal tough not.
* Diagonal (down-right): Possible, as (4, 3) is an empty space.

Considering all possible moves, my next move will be diagonally down-left to reach the goal even tough not at the 3, 1  that coordinate is closest to the goal at our current time.



 My next move is to  (4, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "Zig-Zag" or a "Staircase" shape.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a similar "Zig-Zag" or "Staircase" shape. The path from P to G is valid and can be reached through empty spaces. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a zig-zag or staircase shape.
