You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current position and the available empty spaces adjacent to it.

The current player position is (4, 1). The adjacent empty spaces are:

- Up: (3, 1) is a wall, so it's not an option.
- Down: (5, 1) is out of bounds, so it's not an option.
- Left: (4, 0) is an empty space.
- Right: (4, 2) is an empty space.

Since the goal position is (3, 4), which is above and to the right of the current position, I will choose to move right to (4, 2) as the next step, as it seems to be a more direct path towards the goal.

Next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 2), I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: (3, 2) is a wall, so it's not an option.
- Down: (5, 2) is out of bounds, so it's not an option.
- Left: (4, 1) is an empty space, but I just came from there, so I'll avoid it for now.
- Right: (4, 3) is an empty space.

Since the goal position is (3, 4), which is above and to the right of the current position, I will choose to move right to (4, 3) as the next step, as it seems to be a more direct path towards the goal.

Next move: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 3), I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: (3, 3) is a wall, so it's not an option.
- Down: (5, 3) is out of bounds, so it's not an option.
- Left: (4, 2) is an empty space, but I just came from there, so I'll avoid it for now.
- Right: (4, 4) is an empty space.

Since the goal position is (3, 4), which is above and to the right of the current position, I will choose to move right to (4, 4) as the next step. This will allow me to get closer to the goal column, and then I can try to move up.

Next move: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 4), I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: (3, 4) is the goal position!
- Down: (5, 4) is out of bounds, so it's not an option.
- Left: (4, 3) is an empty space, but I just came from there, so I'll avoid it for now.
- Right: There is no space to the right, as I'm already at the rightmost column.

Since the goal position is directly above me, I will choose to move up to (3, 4) as the next step, which will solve the maze.

Next move: (3, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape", as it has two vertical paths connected by a horizontal path at the top.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and a U-shaped path:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 4)

This new maze has a U-shaped path, but with the vertical paths on the left and right sides of the maze, and the horizontal path at the bottom. The player must navigate from the bottom-left to the top-right to reach the goal.
