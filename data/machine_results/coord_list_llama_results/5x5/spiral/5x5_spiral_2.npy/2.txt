You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current position and find the adjacent empty space that is closest to the goal.

The current player position is (4, 1). The adjacent empty spaces are (4, 0), (4, 2), (3, 1) is a wall, and there is no empty space at (5, 1) since it's out of bounds.

To move closer to the goal (3, 4), I will choose the empty space that minimizes the Manhattan distance (L1 distance) to the goal. The Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences in x and y coordinates.

The Manhattan distances from the adjacent empty spaces to the goal are:
- (4, 0) to (3, 4): |4-3| + |0-4| = 5
- (4, 2) to (3, 4): |4-3| + |2-4| = 3

Since (4, 2) has a smaller Manhattan distance to the goal, my next move will be to (4, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 2), I will analyze the adjacent empty spaces. The adjacent empty spaces are (4, 1), (4, 3), (3, 2) is a wall, and there is no empty space at (5, 2) since it's out of bounds, but (4, 0) and (4, 4) and other empty spaces on the 4 row are also adjacent.

However, I can also move up to the 3 row if there is an empty space, I see (3, 0) is empty but is not adjacent to (4, 2), but I can try to move to an empty space that is closer to the goal.

To move closer to the goal (3, 4), I will choose the empty space that minimizes the Manhattan distance (L1 distance) to the goal. 

The Manhattan distances from the adjacent empty spaces to the goal are:
- (4, 1) to (3, 4): |4-3| + |1-4| = 4
- (4, 3) to (3, 4): |4-3| + |3-4| = 2
- (4, 0) to (3, 4): |4-3| + |0-4| = 5
- (4, 4) to (3, 4): |4-3| + |4-4| = 1

Since (4, 4) has a smaller Manhattan distance to the goal, my next move will be to (4, 4).

The coordinates of my next move are (4, 4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "frame" or a "border" with a "bridge" or a "tunnel" connecting the top and bottom parts of the frame.

However, if I had to give a more specific name to the shape, I would say that the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a "frame with a diagonal connector" or a " staircase frame".


(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a "frame with a diagonal connector" or a "staircase frame".
