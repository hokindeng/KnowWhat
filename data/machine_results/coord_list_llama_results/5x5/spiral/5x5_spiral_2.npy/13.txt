You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current position and the available empty spaces to determine the best move.

Current player position: (4, 1)
Goal position: (3, 4)

Available moves from the current position:
- Up: (4, 0) - empty space
- Down: (4, 2) - empty space
- Left: (3, 1) - wall (not possible)
- Right: (4, 2) - empty space (already considered as down)

Since the goal position is (3, 4), I need to move towards the left and up. However, moving left is not possible due to the wall. Therefore, I will move up to (4, 0) and then reassess the available moves.

Next move: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Current player position: (4, 0)
Goal position: (3, 4)

Available moves from the current position:
- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (4, 1) - empty space
- Left: (3, 0) - empty space
- Right: Not possible (out of bounds)

Since the goal position is (3, 4), I need to move towards the left and down. Moving left to (3, 0) seems like a good option, as it brings me closer to the goal's x-coordinate.

Next move: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Current player position: (3, 0)
Goal position: (3, 4)

Available moves from the current position:
- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: Not possible (wall at (3, 1))
- Left: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Right: Not possible (wall at (3, 1))

However, I can move up is not possible, but I can move to the position above my current position in the previous column which is (2, 0) - empty space.

Next move: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Current player position: (2, 0)
Goal position: (3, 4)

Available moves from the current position:
- Up: (1, 0) - empty space
- Down: (3, 0) - empty space
- Left: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Right: (2, 1) - wall (not possible), but (2, 2) - empty space is available

Since the goal position is (3, 4), I need to move towards the right and down. Moving right to (2, 2) seems like a good option, as it brings me closer to the goal's y-coordinate.

Next move: (2, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces in this maze form a U-shape, similar to the original maze.
