You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (4, 1), and the adjacent empty spaces are:

* Up: (3, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move up.
* Down: (5, 1) is out of bounds, so I cannot move down.
* Left: (4, 0) is an empty space.
* Right: (4, 2) is an empty space.

I will choose to move to the left, to position (4, 0), as it is the closest empty space to the goal position.

My next move is to position (4, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

* Up: (3, 0) is an empty space.
* Down: (5, 0) is out of bounds, so I cannot move down.
* Left: (3, -1) is out of bounds, so I cannot move left.
* Right: (4, 1) is an empty space.

Since my goal is to reach (3, 4), I will choose to move up, to position (3, 0), as it brings me closer to the goal position.

My next move is to position (3, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

* Up: (2, 0) is an empty space.
* Down: (4, 0) is an empty space, but I just came from there, so I won't move back.
* Left: (2, -1) is out of bounds, so I cannot move left.
* Right: Unfortunately, (3, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move right directly towards the goal.

Since I'm blocked by the wall to the right, I will choose to move up, to position (2, 0), to try to find a way around the wall.

My next move is to position (2, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

* Up: (1, 0) is an empty space.
* Down: (3, 0) is an empty space, but I just came from there, so I won't move back.
* Left: (1, -1) is out of bounds, so I cannot move left.
* Right: Unfortunately, (2, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move right directly.

However, I notice that (2, 2) is an empty space, which is two steps to the right. I can try to move there by first moving up to (1, 0) and then moving right twice, or I can try to find another way around the wall.

For now, I will choose to move up, to position (1, 0), to explore the maze further.

My next move is to position (1, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

* Up: (0, 0) is an empty space.
* Down: (2, 0) is an empty space, but I just came from there, so I won't move back.
* Left: (0, -1) is out of bounds, so I cannot move left.
* Right: Unfortunately, (1, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move right directly.

However, I notice that (1, 2) is an empty space, which is two steps to the right. I can try to move there by moving right twice, but I need to find a way to get around the wall at (1, 1).

For now, I will choose to move right is not an option, so I will move up to (0, 0) to explore the maze further.

My next move is to position (0, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Player position: (0, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and forms a U-shape with its empty spaces. It is not an identical copy of the original maze.
