You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current position and the available empty spaces to determine the best move.

Current player position: (4, 1)
Goal position: (3, 4)

Available empty spaces adjacent to the current position:
- Up: (3, 1) is a wall, so it's not an option.
- Down: (5, 1) is out of bounds, so it's not an option.
- Left: (4, 0) is an empty space.
- Right: (4, 2) is an empty space.

Since the goal position is (3, 4), which is above and to the right of the current position, I will choose to move right to get closer to the goal.

Next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Current player position: (4, 2)
Goal position: (3, 4)

Available empty spaces adjacent to the current position:
- Up: (3, 2) is a wall, so it's not an option.
- Down: (5, 2) is out of bounds, so it's not an option.
- Left: (4, 1) is an empty space, but moving left would take me away from the goal.
- Right: (4, 3) is an empty space.

Since the goal position is (3, 4), which is above and to the right of the current position, I will choose to move right to get closer to the goal.

Next move: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Current player position: (4, 3)
Goal position: (3, 4)

Available empty spaces adjacent to the current position:
- Up: (3, 3) is a wall, so it's not an option.
- Down: (5, 3) is out of bounds, so it's not an option.
- Left: (4, 2) is an empty space, but moving left would take me away from the goal.
- Right: (4, 4) is an empty space.

Since the goal position is (3, 4), which is above the current position, I need to find a way to move up. However, the wall at (3, 3) blocks my direct path. I will move right to (4, 4) and then try to find a way to move up in the next step.

Next move: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Current player position: (4, 4)
Goal position: (3, 4)

Available empty spaces adjacent to the current position:
- Up: (3, 4) is the goal position.
- Down: (5, 4) is out of bounds, so it's not an option.
- Left: (4, 3) is an empty space, but moving left would take me away from the goal.
- Right: There is no space to the right, as I am already at the rightmost edge.

Since the goal position is directly above me, I can move up to reach it.

Next move: (3, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "rectangle with a central obstruction" or more specifically, a " rectangle with a smaller rectangle removed from its center".

However, if I had to give a more poetic name to the shape, I would call it a "frame" or a "picture frame" due to its resemblance to a rectangular frame with a central gap.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size as the original, and empty spaces that form the same "frame" shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (0, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and its empty spaces form a "frame" shape. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, and it includes a valid path from the player position to the goal position that can be reached through the empty spaces.
