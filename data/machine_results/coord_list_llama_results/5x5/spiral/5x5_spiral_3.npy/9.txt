You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current position and the adjacent empty spaces.

The current player position is (0, 3). I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 2) is an empty space.
- Down: (0, 4) is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 2) is not the left direction, (0, 1) and then (0, 0) or (-1, 3) is, but (-1, 3) is out of bounds, and (0, 2), (0, 1) and (0, 0) are not the immediate left, but (0, 2) is the space above,  (0, 1) and (0, 0) can be reached going up and then left from (0, 3) two times and then one time, respectively. 
- Right: (0, 4) is the space below, (1, 3) is the immediate right but is a wall.

Considering the goal position (2, 3), I will move down to (0, 4) as the next step, because from there I can continue to navigate through the maze to reach the goal.

Next move: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 4), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 3) is an empty space, but I just came from there.
- Down: Out of bounds.
- Left: (-1, 4) is out of bounds.
- Right: (1, 4) is a wall.

However, I can move up to (0, 3) and then left, or I can try to find another path. A better option is to move to a position that will allow me to progress further. Since the goal is (2, 3), I need to move towards the right and up. But the right path is blocked by a wall. I will move up to a position that can potentially lead me to the right path.

Considering the available options, I will move up to (0, 3) is not the best option, instead I can try to find a way to move to the right, since (1, 4) is a wall I will try one space up from my current position and then try to move right from there.

Next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at the starting position (0, 3). I will re-examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 2) is an empty space.
- Down: (0, 4) is an empty space, but I just came from there.
- Left: (-1, 3) is out of bounds, but (0, 2) is the space above and from there I can move left.
- Right: (1, 3) is a wall.

Since the goal is (2, 3), I need to move towards the right and down is not an option because I will be further from the goal. I will move up to (0, 2) and then try to find a way to move right from there.

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 2), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 1) is an empty space.
- Down: (0, 3) is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 1) is the space above and left, (-1, 2) is out of bounds.
- Right: (1, 2) is a wall.

Since the goal is (2, 3), I need to move towards the right and down. However, the right path is blocked by a wall. I will move down to (0, 3) and then try to find a way to move right from there.

Next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at the position (0, 3) again. I will re-examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 2) is an empty space, but I just came from there.
- Down: (0, 4) is an empty space.
- Left: (-1, 3) is out of bounds, but (0, 2) is the space above and from there I can move left.
- Right: (1, 3) is a wall.

Since the goal is (2, 3), I need to move towards the right and down is not an option because I will be further from the goal in the up and down direction, but I can try to move around the wall. I will move down to (0, 4) and then try to find a way to move right from there.

However, I was in this situation before, I moved up and then down, that is not the solution, I need to try to move left and then down to see if I can move right from there.

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 2), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 1) is an empty space.
- Down: (0, 3) is an empty space, but I was there before.
- Left: (-1, 2) is out of bounds, but (0, 1) is the space above and left.
- Right: (1, 2) is a wall.

Since the goal is (2, 3), I need to move towards the right and down. However, the right path is blocked by a wall. I will move left and up to (0, 1) and then try to find a way to move right from there.

Next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

- Up: (0, 0) is an empty space.
- Down: (0, 2) is an empty space.
- Left: (-1, 1) is out of bounds.
- Right: (1, 1) is a wall.

Since the goal is (2, 3), I need to move towards the right and down. However, the right path is blocked by a wall. I will move down to (0, 2) but I was there before, so I will try to move up to (0, 0) and then try to find a way to move right from there.

Next move: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

Since the goal is (2, 3), I need to move towards the right and down. I will move right to (1, 0) and then try to find a way to move down from there.

Next move: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 0), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: Out of bounds.
- Down: (1, 1) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 0) is an empty space, but I just came from the left.
- Right: (2, 0) is an empty space.

Since the goal is (2, 3), I need to move towards the right and down. I will move right to (2, 0) and then try to find a way to move down from there.

Next move: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 0), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: Out of bounds.
- Down: (2, 1) is a wall.
- Left: (1, 0) is an empty space, but I just came from the left.
- Right: Out of bounds, but I can move down and right, (2, 2) and (3, 0) are adjacent empty spaces that I can move to.

Since the goal is (2, 3), I need to move towards the down. I will move down and right to (2, 2) or down and left to (3, 0) are not the best options, but down and right to (2, 2) is closer to the goal.

However I can move down to (3, 0) and then try to move right from there, but that will be further from the goal in the up and down direction.

Next move: (2, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " Rectangular U-shape" with some additional paths.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form a similar "U-shape" or "Rectangular U-shape" with some additional paths:


Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)


This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a "U-shape" or "Rectangular U-shape" with some additional paths.
