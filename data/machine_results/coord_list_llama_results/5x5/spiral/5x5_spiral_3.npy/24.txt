You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (0, 3), and the adjacent empty spaces are:

* Up: (0, 2)
* Down: None (out of bounds)
* Left: None (out of bounds)
* Right: (0, 4)

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I will move in the direction that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move up to (0, 2).

My next move is: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (0, 2), and the adjacent empty spaces are:

* Up: (0, 1)
* Down: (0, 3)
* Left: (0, 1) then out of bounds, but (0, 0) and (0, 1) are available
* Right: (0, 3) then (0, 4)

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I will move in the direction that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move down to (0, 3).

My next move is: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back to the starting position!

Since I've already explored the options from this position, I'll try to move in a different direction. The player position is (0, 3), and the adjacent empty spaces are:

* Up: (0, 2)
* Down: None (out of bounds)
* Left: None (out of bounds)
* Right: (0, 4)

However, I notice that moving right to (0, 4) doesn't bring me closer to the goal. Instead, I'll try to move around the wall to the right. To do this, I'll move up to (0, 2) and then try to find a path to the right.

My next move is: (0, 2)

(Note: I'll try to find a way to move to the right from the next position)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (0, 2), and the adjacent empty spaces are:

* Up: (0, 1)
* Down: (0, 3)
* Left: (0, 1) then (0, 0)
* Right: None (blocked by wall)

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I will move in the direction that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move left to (0, 1), and then try to find a way to move down and around the wall.

My next move is: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (0, 1), and the adjacent empty spaces are:

* Up: None (out of bounds)

* Left: (0, 0)
* Right: None (blocked by wall)

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I will move in the direction that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move left to (0, 0), and then try to find a way to move down and around the wall.

My next move is: (0, 0)

* Left: None (out of bounds)
* Right: (1, 0)

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I will move in the direction that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move right to (1, 0), which will allow me to move down the right side of the maze and potentially reach the goal.

My next move is: (1, 0)

* Up: None (out of bounds)
* Down: None (blocked by wall)
* Left: (0, 0)
* Right: (2, 0)

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I will move in the direction that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move right to (2, 0), which will allow me to move up the right side of the maze and potentially reach the goal.

My next move is: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (2, 0), and the adjacent empty spaces are:

* Up: None (out of bounds)
* Down: None (blocked by wall)
* Left: (1, 0)
* Right: (3, 0)
* Down-Right: (2, 2) (skipping the wall at (2, 1))

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I will move in the direction that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move down-right to (2, 2), which will allow me to move closer to the goal.

My next move is: (2, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a U-shape that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal position. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it has a similar shape and structure.
