You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 3), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 2) - a valid empty space
- Down: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Left: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Right: (0, 4) - a valid empty space

Since the goal is (2, 3), which is below the current position, I will try to move down. However, moving down is not possible directly. Therefore, I will choose the move that will allow me to move down in the future. Moving up to (0, 2) might not be the best choice, as it will take me away from the goal. Moving right to (0, 4) is also not ideal, but it's a better option than moving up.

My next move will be to (0, 4), as it's the closest empty space that might lead me to the goal in the future.

Next move: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 4), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Down: (1, 4) - not possible, as it's a wall
- Left: (0, 3) - a valid empty space, but it's the previous position
- Right: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- However, I can move down to (1, is not possible but I can move to the empty space (0,3) and from there try to move down to the second row through the empty space at (1, is not possible but there is an empty space at (2, is not directly reachable but the second row has an empty space at (2,0) or (2,2) or (2,4)  that can be reached by first going to the first row then move to the second row) 

Since the goal is (2, 3), which is below the current position, I will try to move down to the second row. The only way to do this is to move left to (0, 3) and then try to find a way to move down.

However, I can move to the second row through the empty space at (2,0) or (2,2) or (2,4). The closest one to the goal is (2, 4) or (2,2) 

To reach (2, 4) or (2,2), I need to move to the first row first. I can move to the first row through the empty space at (1, 0) or (0, 0) then (1,0) then (2,0) or (2,2) or (2,4)

My next move will be to (0, 3), as it's the first step to move to the first row.

Next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 3), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 2) - a valid empty space
- Down: Not possible, as there is a wall at (1, 3)
- Left: (0, 2) - a valid empty space
- Right: (0, 4) - a valid empty space

Since the goal is (2, 3), which is below the current position, I will try to move down to the second row. However, moving down is not possible directly. I need to find a way to move to the first row and then to the second row.

I can move to the first row through the empty space at (1, 0). To reach (1, 0), I need to move to (0, 0) first.

My next move will be to (0, 2), as it's a step closer to (0, 0).

However, I can move to (0,0) directly from (0,3) by moving left 3 times 

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

- Up: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Down: Not possible, as there is a wall at (1, 2)
- Left: (0, 1) - a valid empty space
- Right: (0, 3) - a valid empty space

Since the goal is (2, 3), which is below the current position, I will try to move down to the second row. However, moving down is not possible directly. I need to find a way to move to the first row and then to the second row.

I can move to the first row through the empty space at (1, 0). To reach (1, 0), I need to move to (0, 0) first.

My next move will be to (0, 1), as it's a step closer to (0, 0).

Next move: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (1, 0), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 0) - a valid empty space, but it's a step backward
- Down: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Left: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Right: Not possible, as there is a wall at (1, 1)

However, I can move down to the second row through the empty space at (2, 0).

My next move will be to (2, 0), as it's a step closer to the goal.

Next move: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (2, 0), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Down: Not possible, as there is a wall at (3, 0) in the way of the goal but there is an empty space at (3,0) however the goal is at (2,3) 
- Left: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Right: (2, 2) - a valid empty space, or (2,4) or (2,1) is not possible because there is a wall 

Since the goal is (2, 3), which is to the right of the current position, I will try to move right to (2, 2), which is a valid empty space and closer to the goal.

My next move will be to (2, 2), as it's a step closer to the goal.

Next move: (2, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "rectangle with a tunnel or a bypass".

However, upon closer inspection, I would say that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is more like a " rectangle with a detour" or "a rectangle with a bypass and a dead end" but most closely it resembles an "inverted C shape" or "a rectangle with a C-shaped tunnel" or "a C-shaped or inverted C-shaped corridor" because if you look at the empty spaces they form a C shape that is inverted or a rectangle with a C-shaped tunnel that connects the top left to the bottom right of the rectangle that is formed by the outer walls of the maze.



(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "inverted C shape" or "a rectangle with a C-shaped tunnel":

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an "inverted C shape" or "a rectangle with a C-shaped tunnel".
