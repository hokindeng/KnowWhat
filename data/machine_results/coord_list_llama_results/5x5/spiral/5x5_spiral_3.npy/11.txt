You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (0, 3), and the adjacent empty spaces are:

* Up: (0, 2)
* Down: None (out of bounds)
* Left: None (out of bounds)
* Right: (0, 4)

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I will move in the direction that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move up to (0, 2).

My next move is: (0, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

* Up: (0, 1)
* Down: (0, 3)
* Left: (0, 1) and then out of bounds, or (0, 0) and then left is out of bounds
* Right: (0, 3) and then (0, 4)

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I need to move down and then right to reach the goal. However, there is a wall at (1, 3) that blocks my path. I will move down to (0, 3) and then reassess my options.

My next move is: (0, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at the starting position!

From the current player position (0, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

* Up: (0, 2)
* Down: None (out of bounds)
* Left: None (out of bounds)
* Right: (0, 4)

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I need to move right and then down to reach the goal. However, there is a wall at (1, 3) that blocks my path. I will move right to (0, 4) and then reassess my options.

My next move is: (0, 4)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 4), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

* Up: None (out of bounds)
* Down: None (no empty space below)
* Left: (0, 3)
* Right: None (out of bounds)

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I need to move down to reach the goal. However, there is a wall at (1, 4) that blocks my path. I will move left to (0, 3) and then reassess my options.

Wait, I've been here before!

Let me think... I need to find a way to move down. I can move left to (0, 3) and then try to find a way down, but I've already tried that. Instead, I will try to move down by going around the wall. I will move down to the row below by going to the leftmost column and then moving down.

My next move is: (0, 3) -> no, wait! (1, 0) is a better option, but I'm not adjacent to it. I'll move to (0, 3) and then to (0, 2) or (0, 1) or (0, 0) to get closer to (1, 0).

My next move is: (0, 3) -> no! (0, 0) is a better option to get closer to (1, 0).

My next move is: (0, 0)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces in this maze form a U-shape, similar to the original maze.
