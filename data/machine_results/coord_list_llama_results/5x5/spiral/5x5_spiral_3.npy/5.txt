You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 3), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 2) - a valid empty space
- Down: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Left: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Right: (0, 4) - a valid empty space

Since the goal is (2, 3), which is below the current position, I will try to move down. However, moving down is not possible directly. Therefore, I will choose the next best option, which is to move right, as it might provide more opportunities to move down in the future.

My next move is to (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 4), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 3) - a valid empty space, but it's the previous position
- Down: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Left: (0, 3) - a valid empty space, but it's the previous position
- Right: Not possible, as it's outside the maze

However, I notice that I can move up to (0, 3) and then try to find a way to move down. But since I was already at (0, 3) and moved to (0, 4), I will try to find an alternative.

Let me re-examine the maze. I can move to (1, 0) and then try to find a way to move down. To do that, I need to move left to (0, 3) and then down is not possible, so I will move left again to (0, 2) or (0, 1) or (0, 0) and then move down.

My next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 3), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 2) - a valid empty space
- Down: Not possible, as there is a wall below
- Left: (0, 2) - a valid empty space
- Right: (0, 4) - a valid empty space, but I was already there

Since the goal is (2, 3), which is below the current position, I will try to find a way to move down. However, moving down is not possible directly. Therefore, I will choose the next best option, which is to move left, as it might provide more opportunities to move down in the future.

My next move is to (0, 2).

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 2), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 1) - a valid empty space
- Down: Not possible, as there is a wall below
- Left: (0, 1) - a valid empty space
- Right: (0, 3) - a valid empty space

Since the goal is (2, 3), which is below the current position, I will try to find a way to move down. However, moving down is not possible directly. Therefore, I will choose the next best option, which is to move left, as it might provide more opportunities to move down in the future.

My next move is to (0, 1).

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 1), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 0) - a valid empty space
- Down: Not possible, as there is a wall below
- Left: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Right: (0, 2) - a valid empty space

Since the goal is (2, 3), which is below the current position, I will try to find a way to move down. However, moving down is not possible directly. Therefore, I will choose the next best option, which is to move right, as it might provide more opportunities to move down in the future.

My next move is to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 0), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Down: (1, 0) - a valid empty space
- Left: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Right: (0, 1) - a valid empty space

Since the goal is (2, 3), which is below and to the right of the current position, I will try to find a way to move down and right. Moving down to (1, 0) seems like a good option, as it brings me closer to the goal's y-coordinate.

My next move is to (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (1, 0), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Down: Not possible, as there is a wall below
- Left: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Right: Not possible, as there is a wall to the right

However, I notice that I can move down to the next row by going to (2, 0), which is an empty space. This will bring me closer to the goal's y-coordinate.

My next move is to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (2, 0), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Down: Not possible, as there is a wall below
- Left: (1, 0) - a valid empty space, but it's the previous position
- Right: (2, 2) - a valid empty space, or (2, 4) - a valid empty space, but (2, 2) is closer to the goal

Since the goal is (2, 3), which is to the right of the current position, I will try to find a way to move right. Moving to (2, 2) seems like a good option, as it brings me closer to the goal.

My next move is to (2, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a U-shape or a horseshoe shape.
