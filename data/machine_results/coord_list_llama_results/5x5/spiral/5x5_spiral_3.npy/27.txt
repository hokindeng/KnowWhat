You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current position and the adjacent empty spaces.

The current player position is (0, 3). I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 2) is an empty space.
- Down: (0, 4) is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 2) is not the left direction, (0, 1) and then (0, 0) are, but since we are looking for the most direct path to the goal which is (2, 3), moving left would not be the optimal choice.
- Right: There is no space to the right as the current position is at the edge of the given empty spaces in that direction.

Considering the goal position (2, 3), the most direct path would involve moving down and then right. However, since moving directly to the right isn't an option, I will prioritize moving down to (0, 4) as it is in the general direction towards the goal and allows for future moves to the right.

My next move is to (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 4), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 3) is an empty space, but moving back up would not be progress towards the goal.
- Down: There is no space below as the current position is at the edge of the given empty spaces in that direction.
- Left: (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), and (0, 0) are to the left, but moving left does not directly help in reaching the goal.
- Right: Since the goal is to the right and down from the initial position, but directly to the right from the current position is blocked by walls, I need to find a path that goes around the walls.

Given the goal position (2, 3) and the current position (0, 4), I need to move towards the right but since it's blocked, I will aim to go around the blockage. The closest empty space that allows progress towards the goal is (1, 0), but since I am at (0, 4), a more direct approach to get closer to the goal's column would be to utilize the empty spaces that allow horizontal movement closer to the goal's x-coordinate.

However, considering the direct path to the goal is blocked by walls and my current y-coordinate is already at the maximum for the empty spaces provided, I need to backtrack slightly to utilize the empty space at (0, 3) is not optimal, instead I should aim to move towards (2, 4) as it is on the same y-coordinate as my current position and closer to the goal.

My next move is to (2, 4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "Rectangle with a central obstruction" or more specifically, it can be described as having a "U-shape" or "C-shape" due to the way the empty spaces form a path around the central blockage of walls.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "U-shape" or "C-shape":

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a "U-shape" or "C-shape".
