You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 3), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 2) - a valid empty space
- Down: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Left: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Right: (0, 4) - a valid empty space

Since the goal is (2, 3), which is below the current position, I will try to move down. However, moving down is not possible directly. Therefore, I will choose the next best option, which is to move right to (0, 4) or up to (0, 2). Moving up will take me away from the goal, so I will choose to move right to (0, 4).

My next move is to (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 4), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible, as there is no empty space above
- Down: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Left: (0, 3) - a valid empty space, but it's the previous position
- Right: Not possible, as it's outside the maze

However, I can move down to the next row. Since (1, 4) is a wall, I will move down to the next row through an empty space. The closest empty space in the next row is (2, 4).

My next move is to (2, 4) but since I can only move to adjacent empty spaces, I will move to (1, is not possible)  no I move first to (1,0) no,  I move to  (2, 0) no, I move to (1,0) no I move to (2,4) no I move to (1,0) then (2,0) then (2,4)  no I move (1,0) then (2,0) then (2,2) then (2,4) no. 
My next move is to (1,0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Rectangle with a tunnel or a bypass".

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a rectangle with a smaller rectangle or tunnel "bypassing" or "wrapping around" a central wall. This shape can be thought of as a "Wrap-around rectangle" or a "Bypass rectangle". I will use the term "Wrap-around rectangle" to describe this shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "Wrap-around rectangle" shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a "Wrap-around rectangle".
