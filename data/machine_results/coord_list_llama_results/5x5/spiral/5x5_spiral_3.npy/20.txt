You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (0, 3), and the adjacent empty spaces are:

* Up: (0, 2)
* Down: None (out of bounds)
* Left: None (out of bounds)
* Right: (0, 4)

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I will move in the direction that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move up to (0, 2).

My next move is: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (0, 2), and the adjacent empty spaces are:

* Up: (0, 1)
* Down: (0, 3)
* Left: (0, 1) and then out of bounds if I go further left, but also (0, 0) if I go left and then up 
* Right: None (wall at (1, 2))

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I will move in the direction that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move down to (0, 3).

My next move is: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've been here before! Since I'm back at (0, 3), I'll try a different approach. I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (0, 3), and the adjacent empty spaces are:

* Up: (0, 2)
* Down: None (out of bounds)
* Left: None (out of bounds)
* Right: None (wall at (1, 3)), but I can move left and then down is not an option, however I can move up and then right is not an option either, but I can move up and then left to (0, 2) and then (0, 1) or even (0, 0)

However, I can also try to move left and up at the same time, which is the same as moving up and then left, to (0, 2) and then to (0, 1) or (0, 0) and from (0, 0) I can move right and then down to avoid the wall at (1, 3) 

My next move is: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (0, 2) again! This time, I'll try to move left to (0, 1) and then eventually down to avoid the wall at (1, 3) or I can move left to (0, 1) and then left again to (0, 0) and from there I can move right and then down.

My next move is: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll move left to (0, 0). From there, I can move down to (1, 0) and then continue moving down and right to try to reach the goal.

My next move is: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0, 0), I'll move down to (1, 0). From there, I can move right to (2, 0) and then continue moving up and right to try to reach the goal.

My next move is: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1, 0), I'll move down to (2, 0). From there, I can move right to (2, 2) and then try to move up or right to reach the goal.

My next move is: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 0), I'll move right to (2, 2) and then try to move up or right to reach the goal, but since the goal is at (2, 3) I can move right from (2, 2) to reach the goal but there is a wall at (2, 3) from the down side so I will move right to (2, 2) first.

My next move is: (2, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape", but more specifically it can be described as a rectangle with a smaller rectangle removed from its center, and then connected with a smaller corridor or a " Rectangular shape with a tunnel".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as a "Rectangular shape with a tunnel".
