You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current position and the adjacent empty spaces.

The current player position is (0, 3). I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 2) is an empty space.
- Down: (0, 4) is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 2) is not the left direction, (0, 1) and then (0, 0) or (-1, 3) is, but (-1, 3) is out of bounds, (0, 2) is the correct left adjacent cell in this context though. 
- Right: (0, 4) is the right direction and an empty space.

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I will try to move closer to it. Moving down to (0, 4) does not bring me closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate. Moving up to (0, 2) also does not bring me closer to the goal in terms of the y-coordinate, but it allows me to potentially move right in the future. However, since I need to increase the x-coordinate to reach the goal, I should prioritize moving right if possible.

However, upon re-examining the problem, I realized that I should move to an adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal or at least does not move me away from it in terms of either the x or y coordinate if possible.

Given the current position (0, 3) and the goal (2, 3), and the available empty spaces, I will move to (0, 2) as it's the only viable option to potentially progress towards the goal without moving away from it, but actually, a better move is to move to (1, 0) then (2, 0) to increase the x-coordinate, however (1, 0) is not adjacent to (0, 3), hence the next best move is to move to (0, 2) however another better move is to move to (0, 4) then (1 is blocked) (2, 4) or (4, 4) then (3, 4) or (2, 4), however the most efficient next move is to move to (0, 4) to potentially move to (2, 4) or other subsequent moves.

My next move is to (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 4), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 3) is an empty space, but moving up does not bring me closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate.
- Down: Out of bounds.
- Left: (0, 3) is an empty space, but again, moving left does not bring me closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate.
- Right: Out of bounds in terms of the maze's empty spaces that are provided.

However, I can move up to (0, 3) then left, but that won't bring me closer to the goal. Since the goal is to increase the x-coordinate, I should try to move to the right in terms of the x-coordinate. Unfortunately, the adjacent positions to the right are blocked by walls or out of bounds.

A potential move is to move up to (0, 3), but a better move would be to backtrack is not an option here as we just started, however since we can't move right we should try to move to a position where we can move right in the future, one possible move is to (0, 3) however another possible move is not available at this time.

My next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 2) is an empty space.
- Down: (0, 4) is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 2) is an empty space.
- Right: Unfortunately, the adjacent positions to the right are blocked by walls.

Since the goal is to increase the x-coordinate, I should try to move to a position where I can move right in the future. Moving up to (0, 2) or down to (0, 4) does not bring me closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate. However, I can try to move to a position that allows me to move right later.

One possible move is to move up to (0, 2), then try to find a way to move right. Another possible move is to move down to (0, 4), then try to find a way to move right.

However, I noticed that I can move to (0, 0) by moving left 3 times, then I can move to (1, 0), then I can move to (2, 0), this way I can increase the x-coordinate.

My next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

- Right: Unfortunately, the adjacent positions to the right are blocked by walls.

My next move is to (1, 0).

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 0), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: Out of bounds.
- Down: Out of bounds in terms of empty spaces below.
- Left: (0, 0) is an empty space, but moving left does not bring me closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate.
- Right: (2, 0) is an empty space.

Since the goal is to increase the x-coordinate, I should try to move to a position where I can move right in the future. Moving right to (2, 0) brings me closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate.

My next move is to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 0), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: Out of bounds.
- Down: (2, 1) is a wall, but (2, 2) and other subsequent y-coordinates are empty.
- Left: (1, 0) is an empty space, but moving left does not bring me closer to the goal in terms of the y-coordinate.
- Right: Out of bounds in terms of empty spaces to the right in the x-coordinate.

Since the goal is to increase the y-coordinate to reach (2, 3), I should try to move to a position where I can move down in the future. Moving down to (2, 2) brings me closer to the goal in terms of the y-coordinate.

However, I should also consider that (2, 3) is the goal, but it's blocked by a wall from (2, 2) to (2, 3) is not available, however moving to (2, 2) then (2, 4) then (3, 4) or (4, 4) then (3, 4) or (4, 3) is an option.

My next move is to (2, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " Rectangular U-shape" with some additional corridors.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "U-shape" or "Rectangular U-shape" with some additional corridors:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a "U-shape" or "Rectangular U-shape" with some additional corridors.
