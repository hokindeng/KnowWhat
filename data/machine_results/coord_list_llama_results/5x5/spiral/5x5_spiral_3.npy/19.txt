You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current position and the adjacent empty spaces.

The current player position is (0, 3). I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 2) is an empty space.
- Down: (0, 4) is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 2) is not the left direction, (0, 1) and then (0, 0) or even (-1, 3) if it existed, would be, but (-1, 3) is out of bounds, (0, 2) was already considered, and moving to (0, 1) or (0, 0) would increase the distance to the goal, so I'll ignore left for now.
- Right: This would be (0, 4) which was considered as down or (0, 5) if it existed, but (0, 5) is out of bounds.

Considering the goal position (2, 3), moving down to (0, 4) does not bring me closer to the goal in terms of horizontal distance, but since moving directly to the right is not an option due to the wall at (1, 3) and (1, 4), I need to find a path around the wall.

Given the options, I will move up to (0, 2) because it keeps me closer to the goal in terms of vertical alignment and allows me to potentially move around the wall in the next steps.

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 1) is an empty space.
- Down: (0, 3) is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 1) is not the left direction, (-1, 2) would be, but it's out of bounds.
- Right: (1, 2) is a wall, so moving directly right is not an option.

Considering the goal position (2, 3), I need to find a way to move around the wall. Since moving right is blocked, I will move down to (0, 3) to explore potential paths that could lead me around the wall and closer to the goal.

Next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at the starting position. From the current position (0, 3), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 2) is an empty space, but I already explored that path.
- Down: (0, 4) is an empty space.
- Left: (-1, 3) is out of bounds.
- Right: (1, 3) is a wall, so moving directly right is not an option.

Considering the goal position (2, 3), I need to find a way to move around the wall. Since moving right is blocked, I will move down to (0, 4) to explore potential paths that could lead me around the wall and closer to the goal.

Next move: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 4), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 3) is an empty space, but I already came from there.
- Down: Out of bounds.
- Left: (-1, 4) is out of bounds.
- Right: (1, 4) is a wall, so moving directly right is not an option.

However, I notice that I can move up to (0, 3) and then I would be back to the previous position, or I can try to find another path. A better option would be to move to a position that could potentially lead me to the right side of the maze without hitting the wall. Since I'm at the top-right corner of the empty spaces, I will move left to (0, 3) is not an option, I will try to move to a position that can help me to move down and then right.

Wait, there is no direct move that can help me. I need to backtrack. I will move up to (0, 3).

Next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at the starting position again. From the current position (0, 3), I will examine the adjacent positions:

- Up: (0, 2) is an empty space, but I already explored that path.
- Down: (0, 4) is an empty space, but I already explored that path too.
- Left: (-1, 3) is out of bounds.
- Right: (1, 3) is a wall, so moving directly right is not an option.

Since I already explored the up and down paths, I need to think of a different approach. I will try to move around the wall by going to the left and then down. I will move left and up to (0, 2) and then I will try to move left again.

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

- Right: (1, 0) is an empty space.

Since I need to move around the wall, I will try to move right and then down. I will move right to (1, 0).

Next move: (2, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "rectangle with a tunnel or a bypass".

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a rectangle with a smaller rectangle cut out from its upper-right corner, creating a tunnel or bypass effect.

A more fitting description would be a " rectangle with a corner cut out" or an "L-shape with an extension".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a "rectangle with a corner cut out" or an "L-shape with an extension".
