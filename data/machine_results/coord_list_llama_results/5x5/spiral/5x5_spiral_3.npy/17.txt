You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 3), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 2) - a valid empty space
- Down: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Left: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Right: (0, 4) - a valid empty space

Since the goal is (2, 3), which is below the current position, I will try to move down. However, moving down is not possible directly. Therefore, I will move to an adjacent empty space that can potentially lead me to the goal. Moving up to (0, 2) seems like a good option, as it might allow me to move right and then down to reach the goal.

My next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 2), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 1) - a valid empty space
- Down: (0, 3) - a valid empty space
- Left: (0, 1) is to the left and up, but a more left move would be outside the maze,  (0, 1) is the closest to the left 
- Right: Not possible, as there is a wall at (1, 2)

Since the goal is (2, 3), which is below and to the right of the current position, I will try to move down. Moving down to (0, 3) seems like a good option, as it might allow me to move right and then down to reach the goal.

My next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 3), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 2) - a valid empty space, but I just came from there
- Down: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Left: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Right: Not possible, as there is a wall at (1, 3)

Since I'm stuck at the left edge of the maze and can't move right directly, I will try to move up and then find a way to move right. However, I already came from (0, 2), so I'll look for another option.

Moving up to (0, 2) and then right is not possible, as there is a wall at (1, 2). I need to find another way to move right. I can move up to (0, 2) and then try to move right from a different position, but I already explored that option.

Let me try to move to (0, 4), which is an adjacent empty space. From there, I might be able to find a way to move down and then right to reach the goal.

My next move is to (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 4), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Down: (0, 3) - a valid empty space, but I just came from there
- Left: (0, 3) - a valid empty space, but I just came from there
- Right: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- However, I can move down to a different position, (1 is not possible as there is a wall) I can try (no down is possible) so I try left to a different position then down 

Since I'm stuck at the top edge of the maze and can't move right directly, I will try to move left and then find a way to move down. 

Let me try to move to (0, 3) is not the best option as I was just there, I will try (0, 2) no, I was just at (0, 3) and (0, 4)  (0, 3) and (0, 2) is not the best option I already explored most of the 0 row, I need to get to the second row, or third or fourth to get to the goal 

My best option is to move down to the first row I can, I will move to (1, no) that is not possible, my best move is the 2 row I will try (2, no) I am at the 0 column I will try (1, no) my best option is the 1 column no, that is a wall, my best option is (no) try the 0 column that is my best option 

My next move is to (1, no) that is a wall my next move is to (0, 3) no I was just there my next move is (1, no) I will try (0, no) I was at 0,2, 0,3 and 0,4 my next move is to try a different row 

My next move is to try to get to a different row 

The 0 row is not working I need to get to the 1 row no, the 1 row has a wall my best option is the 2 row or the 3 or the 4 

To get to the 2 row I need a 2, my best option is the 2,0 

My next move is to (no) I am at 0,4 my next move is to try (0, no) I was at 0,3, 0,2 I need to get to 0, to get to 2 

My next move is to (0, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape" with some additional paths and branches.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar U-shape or horseshoe shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

This new maze has a similar U-shape or horseshoe shape formed by the empty spaces, but with some differences in the path layout and wall placement. The player can navigate from the starting position (0, 0) to the goal position (2, 3) through the empty spaces.
