You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (0, 3), and the adjacent empty spaces are (0, 2) and (0, 4).

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I will move towards the right and down to get closer to the goal. Therefore, my next move will be to (0, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. The available options are (0, 1) and (0, 3).

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I need to move down to get closer to the goal. However, there is a wall at (1, 2) that blocks my path. I will move to (0, 1) to try to find an alternative route.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape", with the empty spaces forming a curved path around the walls.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar U-shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a U-shape that allows the player to navigate from the starting position to the goal position. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it retains the same general shape and structure.
