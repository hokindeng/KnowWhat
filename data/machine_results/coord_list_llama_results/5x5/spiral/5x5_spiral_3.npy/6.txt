You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current position and the available empty spaces adjacent to it.

The current player position is (0, 3). The adjacent empty spaces are:

- Up: (0, 2)
- Down: Not available (out of bounds)
- Left: Not available (out of bounds)
- Right: (0, 4)

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I will try to move closer to it. Moving up to (0, 2) seems to be a good option as it allows me to potentially move right and then down to reach the goal.

My next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 2), I will analyze the available empty spaces adjacent to it:

- Up: (0, 1)
- Down: (0, 3)
- Left: (0, 1) and then out of bounds, or directly out of bounds if moving left from (0, 2)
- Right: Not available (wall at (1, 2))

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I need to move down and then right. However, there is a wall at (1, 2) and (1, 3), so I need to find an alternative path. Moving down to (0, 3) seems to be a good option as it allows me to potentially move right and then down to reach the goal.

My next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 3), I will analyze the available empty spaces adjacent to it:

- Up: (0, 2)
- Down: Not available (out of bounds)
- Left: Not available (out of bounds)
- Right: Not available (wall at (1, 3))

Since the goal position is (2, 3), I need to move right, but there is a wall at (1, 3). I will try to move around the wall. Moving up to (0, 2) seems to be a good option as it allows me to potentially move right and then down to reach the goal.

However, I already moved to (0, 2) and then back to (0, 3) in the previous steps. I need to try a different approach. I will move to (0, 4), which is the only other available empty space adjacent to the current position.

My next move is to (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 4), I will analyze the available empty spaces adjacent to it:

- Up: Not available (out of bounds)
- Down: Not available (out of bounds)
- Left: (0, 3)
- Right: Not available (wall at (1, 4))

However, I notice that there is an empty space at (2, 4) which is two steps down from the current position in the right direction, but I need to move left first to avoid the wall at (1, 4). Then I can move down to (2, 4) and potentially move left to reach the goal.

My next move is to (0, 3) to start moving around the wall.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 3), I will analyze the available empty spaces adjacent to it:

- Up: (0, 2)
- Down: Not available (out of bounds)
- Left: Not available (out of bounds)
- Right: Not available (wall at (1, 3))

However, I remember that I was trying to move to (2, 4) to get closer to the goal. To do that, I need to move up to (0, 2) or (0, 4) and then find a way to move down to (2, 4). Since I already tried moving up to (0, 2) and it didn't lead to a solution, I will try moving up to (0, 4) again.

My next move is to (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 4), I will analyze the available empty spaces adjacent to it:

- Up: Not available (out of bounds)
- Down: Not available (out of bounds)
- Left: (0, 3)
- Right: Not available (wall at (1, 4))

However, I notice that there is an empty space at (2, 4) which is two steps down from the current position in the right direction. To move down, I need to move left first to (0, 3) and then find a way to move down to (1, is not available due to the wall, but (2, 0) and (2, 4) are). Then I can move to (2, 4) and potentially move left to reach the goal.

My next move is not to (0, 3), but I will try to find another path. I will move to (0, 0) and then try to move to (1, 0), (2, 0) and then (2, 4) or directly to the goal if possible.

My next move is to (0, 3) is not the best move, I will try to move to (0, 0) by first moving to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

- Right: Not available (wall at (1, 3))

However, I remember that I was trying to move to (0, 0) to find an alternative path to the goal. To do that, I need to move up to (0, 2) and then continue moving up.

My next move is to (0, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " Rectangular U-shape" with some additional corridors.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "U-shape" or "Rectangular U-shape" with some additional corridors:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it has a similar shape formed by its empty spaces, and it includes a valid path from the player position to the goal.
