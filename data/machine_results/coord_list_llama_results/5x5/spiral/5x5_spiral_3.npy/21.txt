You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 3), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 2) - a valid empty space
- Down: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Left: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Right: (0, 4) - a valid empty space

Since the goal is (2, 3), which is below the current position, I will try to move down. However, moving down is not possible directly. Therefore, I will move to an adjacent empty space that can potentially lead me to the goal. Moving up to (0, 2) seems like a good option, as it might allow me to move right and then down to reach the goal.

My next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 2), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 1) - a valid empty space
- Down: (0, 3) - a valid empty space
- Left: (0, 1) - a valid empty space, but not the best option
- Right: Not possible, as (0, 3) is the only option to the right, and (1, 2) is a wall

Since the goal is (2, 3), which is below and to the right of the current position, I will try to move down and then right. Moving down to (0, 3) seems like a good option, as it might allow me to move right and then down to reach the goal.

My next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 3), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 2) - a valid empty space, but I already came from there
- Down: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Left: (0, 2) - a valid empty space, but I already came from there
- Right: Not possible directly, as (1, 3) is a wall

However, I can move up to (0, 2) and then try to find another path, or I can try to move around the wall. Since moving up doesn't seem to provide a new opportunity, I will try to move around the wall. I can move to (0, 4), which is an empty space, and then try to move down and around the wall.

My next move is to (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 4), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible, as it's outside the maze
- Down: (0, 3) - a valid empty space, but I already came from there
- Left: (0, 3) - a valid empty space, but I already came from there
- Right: Not possible directly, as it's outside the maze, but I can try to move down and then right

However, I can move down to (0, 3) and then try to find another path, which doesn't seem to provide a new opportunity. Instead, I can try to move around the wall by going down to a different empty space. I notice that (2, 4) is an empty space, and if I can reach it, I might be able to move left to the goal or find another path.

To reach (2, 4), I need to move down. Since I'm at the top row, I can move down to any empty space in the column below. I see that (1, 0) is an empty space in the row below, but it's not in the same column. However, I can try to move to (1, 0) and then move right. Another option is to move to (2, 0) or (3, 0) or (4, 0) and then move right, but that would take more steps.

A better option is to move to (1, 0) and then try to move right. However, I'm at (0, 4), so I need to move to a position that allows me to move down to (1, 0) or move to a position that allows me to move down to a position that can reach (2, 4). Since I'm at the rightmost column, I need to move left to a position that allows me to move down.

My next move is to (0, 0), which will allow me to move down to (1, 0) and then try to move right.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape", as it has two vertical paths connected by a horizontal path at the top.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a U-shape.
