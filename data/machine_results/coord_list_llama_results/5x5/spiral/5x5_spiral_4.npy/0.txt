You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. Based on the current player position (1,0) and the surrounding empty spaces, I'll choose the next move.

Available empty spaces adjacent to the current position (1,0) are:

* Up: Not possible, as it's out of the maze bounds
* Down: (2,0) is empty
* Left: Not possible, as it's out of the maze bounds
* Right: Not possible, as there is a wall at (1,1)

Considering these options, my next move is to move down to (2,0).

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze state, I'll evaluate the adjacent empty spaces to the current player position (2,0).

Available empty spaces adjacent to the current position (2,0) are:

* Up: (1,0) is empty
* Down: (3,0) is empty
* Left: Not possible, as it's out of the maze bounds
* Right: Not possible, as there is a wall at (2,1)

Since I've already moved down from (1,0) to (2,0), it wouldn't be efficient to move back up to (1,0). Instead, I'll move further down to (3,0) to make progress towards the goal.

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting close to the goal!

With the updated maze state, I'll evaluate the adjacent empty spaces to the current player position (3,0).

Available empty spaces adjacent to the current position (3,0) are:

* Up: (2,0) is empty
* Down: Not possible, as there is a wall at (4,1), but (4,0) is the goal and it's not explicitly listed as a wall or an empty space; since the goal is (4,0), I will attempt to move there
* Left: Not possible, as it's out of the maze bounds
* Right: Not possible, as there is a wall at (3,1)

Given this information, I'll try to move down to the goal position (4,0).

So, the coordinates of my next move are: (4,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors)**

The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the maze is a "zigzag" or "staircase" shape, where the corridors wind their way around the walls to connect the player position to the goal.

**2. New maze of the same size with the same shape**

Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 4)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a zigzag shape that allows the player to navigate from the player position to the goal, but the specific locations of the walls and empty spaces are different from the original maze.
