You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (4, 2), and the goal is (3, 0). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: (4, 1) or (3, 2) is a wall, but (4, 1) is empty, so I can move up.
- Down: (4, 3) is empty.
- Left: (3, 2) is a wall.
- Right: (4, 3) is empty, but it's not the best move since I need to go up and left to reach the goal.

Considering the goal position, I will choose to move up to (4, 1) as it brings me closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (4, 1), and the goal is (3, 0). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: (3, 1) is a wall.
- Down: (4, 2) is empty, but it's not the best move since I need to go up and left to reach the goal.
- Left: (3, 1) is a wall, but (4, 0) is empty.
- Right: (4, 2) is empty, but it's not the best move since I need to go up and left to reach the goal.

Considering the goal position, I will choose to move left to (4, 0) as it brings me closer to the goal and might provide an opportunity to move up later.

The coordinates of my next move are (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (4, 0), and the goal is (3, 0). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:
- Up: Not possible, as I am already at the top row of the maze in this column.
- Down: (4, 1) is empty, but it's not the best move since I need to go left to reach the goal.
- Left: (3, 0) is the goal, but it's not directly accessible because I don't know if I can move diagonally or through walls. However, I can try to move to an empty space that is closer to the goal. Unfortunately, (3, 0) is the goal and is directly to my left, but I am not allowed to move there directly from my current position because (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) and (3,4) are all walls and I am not allowed to move diagonally.
- Right: (4, 1) is empty, but it's not the best move since I need to go left to reach the goal.

However, I can move up is not an option, I can try moving to a position that could allow me to move left in the future. In this case I can try moving to (3,0) is not possible so I should try (2,0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and has a U-shaped corridor formed by the empty spaces. However, it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
