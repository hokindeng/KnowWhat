You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (4, 2), and the adjacent empty spaces are:

* (4, 1)
* (4, 3)
* (3, 2) (not empty, it's a wall)
* (5, 2) (out of bounds)

My next move will be to the empty space (4, 1), as it is the only adjacent empty space that is closer to the goal position.

Next move: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 1), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

* (4, 0)
* (4, 2)
* (3, 1) (not empty, it's a wall)
* (5, 1) (out of bounds)

My next move will be to the empty space (4, 0), as it is the only adjacent empty space that is closer to the goal position and does not lead to a dead end.

Next move: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

* (3, 0) (goal position)
* (4, 1)
* (5, 0) (out of bounds)
* (4, -1) (out of bounds)

Since the goal position (3, 0) is adjacent to the current player position, I will move directly to the goal.

Next move: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape", with the player starting at one end of the U and the goal at the other end.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and a U-shaped path:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

This new maze has a U-shaped path that connects the player position to the goal position, and it meets all the criteria mentioned above.
