You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (4, 2), and the goal is (3, 0). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:

- Up: (4, 1) or (3, 2) is a wall, but (4, 1) is empty, so it's a possible move.
- Down: (4, 3) is empty, so it's a possible move.
- Left: (3, 2) is a wall, so it's not a possible move.
- Right: (4, 3) or (5, 2) is out of bounds, but (4, 3) is empty, so it's a possible move (already considered in the down direction).

Since the goal is (3, 0), which is up and to the left of the current position, I will prioritize the up direction. Therefore, my next move is to (4, 1).

The coordinates of my next move are (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (4, 1), and the goal is (3, 0). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The possible moves are:

- Up: (3, 1) is a wall, so it's not a possible move.
- Down: (4, 2) is empty, so it's a possible move, but it's moving away from the goal.
- Left: (3, 1) is a wall, so it's not a possible move.
- Right: (4, 2) is empty, but it's moving away from the goal (already considered in the down direction).

However, I can move to (4, 0), which is an empty space and closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate.

The coordinates of my next move are (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (4, 0), and the goal is (3, 0). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

Since the goal is directly to the left of the current position, I can move to (3, 0) if it's not blocked by a wall from the current position's perspective, which in this case is not, as the wall is below (3,0) at (3,1). 

The coordinates of my next move are (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "rectangle with a tunnel or a bypass".

However, upon closer inspection, I would say that the shape is more like an "inverted C" or a "reversed C" shape, considering the way the empty spaces form a path from the top to the bottom, curving around the walls.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "inverted C" shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 0)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form an "inverted C" shape, similar to the original maze.
