You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 4), and the goal is (2, 1). Since I can move only through empty spaces, I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 4) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: (1, 4) is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 3) is an empty space.
- Right: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), moving left to (0, 3) seems to be a better option, as it would allow me to move closer to the goal in the subsequent steps.

My next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 3) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 3) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 2) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 4) is an empty space.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), moving left to (0, 2) seems to be a better option, as it would allow me to move closer to the goal in the subsequent steps.

My next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 2) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 2) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 1) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 3) is an empty space.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), moving left to (0, 1) seems to be a better option, as it would allow me to move closer to the goal in the subsequent steps.

My next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 1), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 1) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 1) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 0) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 2) is an empty space.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), moving left to (0, 0) seems to be a better option, as it would allow me to move closer to the goal in the subsequent steps by potentially moving down to (2, 0) and then right to (2, 1).

My next move is to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 0) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 0) is a wall.
- Left: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Right: (0, 1) is an empty space, but I already came from there.

However, I notice that I can move down to the second row, but not directly. I can move right to (0, 1) and then I'll be back to the previous position, or I can try to find another way to move down. Since (2, 0) is an empty space, I can try to move down to the second row through another column. 

In this case, I can move right to (0, 1) and then continue as before, or I can wait for a better option. However, I see that there is no better option than moving right and then down through another column.

Wait, there is no column that allows me to move down. I must move to the right of the wall to move down.

My next move is to (0, 1) and then continue to the right of the wall to move down. However, I already knew that (0, 1) is not the best option.

Let me rethink this... If I move right multiple times, I can reach (0, 4) and then move down to (1, 4) or continue to the right, which is not possible. Then, from (1, 4), I can move down to (2, 4) or left, which will not help me. From (2, 4), I can move left to (2, 0) or continue left to (2, 1) through (2, 2) and then (2, 1).

Considering this, my next move is to (0, 4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape", as it has two vertical paths connected by a horizontal path at the top.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a U-shape.
