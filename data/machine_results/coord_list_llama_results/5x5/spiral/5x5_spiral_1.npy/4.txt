You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 4), and the goal is (2, 1). Since I can move only through empty spaces, I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 4) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: (1, 4) is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 3) is an empty space.
- Right: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), I will choose to move left to (0, 3), as it seems to be a more direct path towards the goal.

My next move is: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 3) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 3) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 2) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 4) is an empty space.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), I will choose to move left to (0, 2), as it seems to be a more direct path towards the goal.

My next move is: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 2) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 2) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 1) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 3) is an empty space.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), I will choose to move left to (0, 1), as it seems to be a more direct path towards the goal.

My next move is: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 1), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 1) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 1) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 0) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 2) is an empty space.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), I will choose to move left to (0, 0), as it seems to be a more direct path towards the goal, potentially allowing me to move down to the second row.

My next move is: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 0) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 0) is a wall.
- Left: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Right: (0, 1) is an empty space.

However, I notice that I can move down to the second row if I move right to (0, 1) and then there are no available moves down. But I can move right to (0, 1) and then right again to (0, 2) and then I see no available moves down again but I see that (2, 0) and (2, 2) are empty and I can try to reach (2, 1) from (2, 0) or (2, 2). 

Considering the goal position (2, 1), I will choose to move right to (0, 1).

My next move is: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 1), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 1) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 1) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 0) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 2) is an empty space.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), I will choose to move right to (0, 2), as I previously thought that I can try to reach (2, 1) from (2, 0) or (2, 2) and moving right will bring me closer to the second column.

My next move is: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 2) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 2) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 1) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 3) is an empty space.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), I will choose to move left to (0, 1), and then I will try to move down to the second row, but since (1, 1) is a wall, I will try to move to (2, 0) and then to (2, 1).

However, I notice that I was in (0, 1) before and I moved to (0, 2) to try to reach (2, 2) and then (2, 1). So, I will move right to (0, 3) to try to find another path.

My next move is: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 4), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (1, 4) are:

- Up: (0, 4) is an empty space.
- Down: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze bounds for the column, but (2, 4) is an empty space.
- Left: Not possible, as (1, 3) is a wall.
- Right: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), I will choose to move down to (2, 4), as I can then try to move to the second column.

My next move is: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 4), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (2, 4) are:

- Up: (1, 4) is an empty space.
- Down: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze bounds for the column, but (3, 4) is an empty space.
- Left: (2, 2) is an empty space and (2, 3) is a wall and then (2, 1) and (2, 0) are the goal and an empty space respectively but I can't move directly to them because of the wall at (2, 3) but I can move to (2, 2).
- Right: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), I will choose to move left to (2, 2), as I can then try to move to the second column and then to the goal.

My next move is: (2, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "rectangle with a tunnel or a bypass".

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a rectangle with a smaller rectangle removed from its center, creating a tunnel or a bypass. This shape can be described as a "frame" or a "border" with a tunnel or a bypass.

A more fitting description would be that the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a "picture frame" with a tunnel or a bypass.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a "picture frame" with a tunnel or a bypass.
