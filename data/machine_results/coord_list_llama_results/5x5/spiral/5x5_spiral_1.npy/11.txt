You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 4), and the goal is (2, 1). Since I can move only through empty spaces, I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 4) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: (1, 4) is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 3) is an empty space.
- Right: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), moving left to (0, 3) seems to be a better option, as it would bring me closer to the goal.

My next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 3) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 3) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 2) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 4) is an empty space.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), moving left to (0, 2) seems to be a better option, as it would bring me closer to the goal and potentially allow me to move down in the future.

My next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 2) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 2) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 1) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 3) is an empty space.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), moving left to (0, 1) seems to be a better option, as it would bring me closer to the goal and potentially allow me to move down in the future.

My next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 1), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 1) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 1) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 0) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 2) is an empty space.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), moving left to (0, 0) seems to be a better option, as it would allow me to potentially move down to (2, 0) and then right to (2, 1) in the future.

My next move is to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 0) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 0) is a wall.
- Left: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Right: (0, 1) is an empty space, but I've already been there.

However, I notice that (2, 0) is an empty space, and it's closer to the goal. To get there, I would need to move down, but since (1, 0) is a wall, I'll have to find another way. I can move right to (0, 1) and then try to find a path down.

But wait, I see a better option. Since (2, 0) is an empty space, I can try to move down to the second row, but not directly. I can move right to (0, 1) and then try to move down, but that won't work. Instead, I can try to move to the second row through another column. I notice that (2, 0) is an empty space, and (3, 0) is also an empty space. This means that (2, 0) is accessible from the left side of the maze.

My next move is to try to get to the left side of the maze, but since I'm already on the leftmost column, I'll move down through another column. I'll move right to (0, 1) and then try to find a way down. However, I've already been to (0, 1), so I'll try to move to (0, 4) and then down.

But that's not the best option. Since (2, 0) is an empty space, I can try to move to the second row through the (3, 0) space. To get to (3, 0), I would need to move right and then down.

My next move is to (0, 1), no, wait. My next move is to try to get to (3, 0). To get to (3, 0), I would need to move right and then down. However, I can move right to (0, 4) and then down to (1, 4), then down to (2, 4), then down to (3, 4), and finally left to (3, 0). But that's not the best option.

My next move is to (0, 4), no, wait. Since (2, 0) is an empty space, I can try to move to the second row through the (2, 0) space. To get to (2, 0), I would need to move right and then down, but since (1, 0) is a wall, I'll have to find another way. I can move right to (0, 4) and then down to (1, 4), then left to (1, is not an option), no. I can move right to (0, 4) and then down to (1, 4), then down is not an option.

Wait, I have it. Since (2, 0) is an empty space, I can try to move to the second row through the (2, 0) space. To get to (2, 0), I would need to move right and then down, but since (1, 0) is a wall, I'll have to find another way. I notice that (2, 0) is in the same column as my current position, so I can try to move down through another column and then left.

No, wait. I can move down through the (1, 4) space. To get to (1, 4), I would need to move right.

My next move is to (0, 4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape", with the empty spaces forming a curved path around the walls.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar U-shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a U-shape that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape.
