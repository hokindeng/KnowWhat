You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 4), and the goal is (2, 1). Since I can move only through empty spaces, I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 4) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: (1, 4) is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 3) is an empty space.
- Right: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), moving left to (0, 3) seems to be a better option, as it would bring me closer to the goal.

My next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 3) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 3) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 2) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 4) is an empty space.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), moving left to (0, 2) seems to be a better option, as it would bring me closer to the goal and potentially allow me to move down in the future.

My next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 2) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 2) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 1) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 3) is an empty space.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), moving left to (0, 1) seems to be a better option, as it would bring me closer to the goal and potentially allow me to move down in the future.

My next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 1), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 1) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 1) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 0) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 2) is an empty space.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), moving left to (0, 0) seems to be a better option, as it would allow me to potentially move down to (1 is blocked but maybe 2 or another row) in the future.

My next move is to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 0) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 0) is a wall.
- Left: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Right: (0, 1) is an empty space, but I've already been there.

However, I notice that I can move down to the second row, but not directly. I can move to the right and then try to move down.

But wait, I see that (2, 0) is an empty space. If I can get to the second row, I can move to the right and then up is not possible but left and right are and one of those is my target.

My next move is to try and get to the second row. Since (1, 0) is a wall, I will try to move to (0, 1) and then find another way to get to the second row.

My next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 1), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 1) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 1) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 0) is an empty space, but I've already been there.
- Right: (0, 2) is an empty space.

However, I still want to get to the second row. I notice that (2, 0) is an empty space, and I can try to get there by moving right and then finding a way down.

But I also notice that I can move right to (0, 2) and then move down is not possible, but I can move further right and then move down.

My next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

- Left: (0, 1) is an empty space, but I've already been there.
- Right: (0, 3) is an empty space.

However, I still want to get to the second row. I notice that moving right to (0, 3) and then moving further right to (0, 4) might give me an opportunity to move down.

My next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 4), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (0, 4) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: (1, 4) is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 3) is an empty space, but I've already been there.
- Right: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.

I will move down to (1, 4), which might give me an opportunity to move left and get closer to the goal.

My next move is to (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 4), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (1, 4) are:

- Up: (0, 4) is an empty space, but I've already been there.
- Down: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze or into a wall.
- Left: Not possible, as (1, 3) is a wall.
- Right: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.

However, I notice that I can move down to the second row by going to the leftmost part of the current row and then moving down. But that's not possible here.

But I can move down to the second row by going to the second row through the rightmost column.

My next move is to (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 4), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The possible moves from (2, 4) are:

- Up: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.
- Down: (3, 4) is an empty space.
- Left: (2, 2) and (2, 0) and other spaces to the left are potential moves but (2, 3) is a wall so I have to go around it, and (2, 2) is the closest I can get to the goal for now.
- Right: Not possible, as it would be out of the maze.

My next move is to (2, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "rectangle with a tunnel or a bypass".

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a rectangle with a smaller rectangle or tunnel cut out from its center, or more specifically, an "H" shape or two rectangles connected by a tunnel.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "H" shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an "H" shape.
