You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and provide the immediate next step.

Given the player position is at (0, 4) and the goal is at (2, 1), I need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. The current position is at the top-right corner of the maze, and the goal is below and to the left of the current position.

The walls are positioned in a way that blocks direct movement towards the goal. However, I can move left from the current position to (0, 3), which is an empty space.

My next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), I can move left to (0, 2), which is an empty space. This move brings me closer to the goal and avoids the walls.

My next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), I can move left to (0, 1), which is an empty space. This move brings me closer to the goal and avoids the walls.

My next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), I can move down to (1, 1), but that's a wall. I can move left to (0, 0), which is an empty space. However, moving left doesn't bring me closer to the goal. I can also move up, but that's not an option since I'm already at the top row.

A better option is to move right to (0, 2), but I've already been there. Since I need to move down to reach the goal, I'll try to find an alternative route. I can move left to (0, 0) and then try to move down from there.

My next move is to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 0), I can move right to (0, 1), but I've already been there. I can move down to (1, 0), but that's a wall.

However, I notice that I can move down to the next available empty space, which is (2, 0). This move brings me closer to the goal and avoids the walls.

My next move is to is not possible directly, I can move right and then try to move down. However a better option is not to move right, a better option is not available for column 0 so I will move right to (0, 1) and then I will try to move down from the next column.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), I can move right to (0, 2), but I've already been there. I can move left to (0, 0), but I've already been there too. I can move up, but that's not an option since I'm already at the top row.

However, I notice that I can move down to the next available empty space in column 2 and then try to move left to column 1. But first I need to move right to column 2.

My next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), I can move down to (1, 2), but that's a wall. I can move right to (0, 3), but that doesn't bring me closer to the goal. I can move left to (0, 1), but I've already been there.

However, I notice that I can move down to the next available empty space in column 2, which is (2, 2). This move brings me closer to the goal and avoids the walls.

My next move is to (2, 2) but I am at (0, 2) so I need to move down to (1, 2) but it is a wall, so I will move down in column 0 or column 4 and then I will move to column 2.

My next move is to (1, 4) but I am at (0, 2) so I will move right to (0, 4) or left to (0, 0) and then down.

My next move is to (0, 4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape", but more specifically, it can be described as a " Rectangular U-shape" or " Rectangular Horseshoe shape" since it has a rectangular shape with a U-shaped or horseshoe-shaped path.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as a "Rectangular U-shape" or "Rectangular Horseshoe shape".
