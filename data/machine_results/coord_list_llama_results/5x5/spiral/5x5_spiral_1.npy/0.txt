You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current position and the maze to determine the best possible next step.

The current player position is (0, 4), and the goal is (2, 1). Since the goal is to the right and down from the current position, I will try to move in that direction.

Analyzing the maze, I see that I can move down from (0, 4) to (1, 4) since (1, 4) is an empty space.

My next move is: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 4), I will try to move closer to the goal (2, 1). Since I am already at the correct x-coordinate (1) to move to the goal's x-coordinate (2), I will try to move left to decrease the y-coordinate.

Analyzing the maze, I see that I can move left from (1, 4) to (1, 3) is not possible since (1, 3) is a wall. However, I can move left is not an option, but I can try to move up is not an option either, but I can try to move down is not possible, but I can move right is not an option to get closer to the goal in the x-direction. 

However I can move to (2, 4).

My next move is: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 4), I will try to move closer to the goal (2, 1). Since I am already at the correct x-coordinate (2), I will try to move left to decrease the y-coordinate.

Analyzing the maze, I see that I can move left from (2, 4) to (2, 3) is not possible since (2, 3) is a wall, but I can move left from (2, 4) to (2, 2) since (2, 2) is an empty space.

My next move is: (2, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "rectangle with a tunnel or a bypass".

However, analyzing the maze more deeply I can see that the empty spaces form a shape that could be described more specifically as an "L-shape" or "two rectangles connected at a corner" with a tunnel or bypass connecting the two parts of the L.


(2) Here is a new maze with the same size as the original, a valid path from P to G, and the same general L-shape formed by the empty spaces:


Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 4)
