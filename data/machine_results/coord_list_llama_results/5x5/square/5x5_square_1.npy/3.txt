You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is at (1, 3), and the goal position is at (0, 1). I can see that there are empty spaces at (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3) that I can potentially move to.

However, I notice that the goal position is located above and to the left of my current position. I should prioritize moving left or up to get closer to the goal.

Considering the available empty spaces, my next move will be to the left, to the position (1, 2). However, since (1, 2) is a wall, I will instead move up and left, but that is not possible, so I will move up is not possible either, I will move down is not a good idea, I will move left and down would be moving away from the goal, so the best move is to move left  and up is not possible, the next best is just move up, no, I can do better, I will move to the best position possible,  move up and...  actually I can only move left.

My next move coordinates will be: (1, 2) no, (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

I'm currently at (2, 3), and the goal is still at (0, 1). Since I'm above the row of the goal, I'll prioritize moving up. However, I can see that there's a wall at (2, 4) and I'll get stuck if I move up further. So, I'll move left instead.

Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that (2, 2) and (2, 1) are available. I can move to either of those positions.

My next move will be to the left. I'll choose the closer position, which is (2, 2).

My next move coordinates will be: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

I'm currently at (2, 2), and the goal is at (0, 1). I've moved closer to the goal by moving left, and I should continue moving left or up to reach the goal.

Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that (2, 1) is available, which is left of my current position. I can also see that (1, 1) is available, which is left and up of my current position.

My next move will be to the left. I'll choose the closer position, which is (2, 1).

My next move coordinates will be: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

I'm currently at (2, 1), and the goal is at (0, 1). I'm in the same column as the goal, so I just need to move up to reach it.

However, I see that (1, 2) is a wall, and I'll get stuck if I try to move up and right. But I can see that (1, 1) is an empty space, which is up and left is not needed, just up is not a movement I can do, since that space is blocked by the wall (1, 2), but I can move up and left, no that is not the movement, I can do the only movement possible, I can do is move up but 1 space below there is a wall (2,0), if I try to go up to 1 and try to pass to 0 I can do, I go up but not via (1,2), I can go (1,1).

My next move coordinates will be: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

I'm currently at (1, 1), and the goal is at (0, 1). I'm just one step away from the goal, and I can see that there is no wall between my current position and the goal.

My next move is straightforward: I'll move up to the goal position.

My next move coordinates will be: (0, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L" shape.

The corridors form an L shape, which is a common structure in maze design. The L shape provides a single path for the solver to follow, with some optional dead ends and turns.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

This new maze meets all the criteria:

* It has the same size as the original maze (5x5)
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L shape.
