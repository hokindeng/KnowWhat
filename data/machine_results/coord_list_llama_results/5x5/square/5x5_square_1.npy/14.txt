You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. 

First, I need to analyze the current maze and identify possible next moves from the current player position (1, 3).

The current player position (1, 3) has adjacent empty spaces at (1, 2 is a wall, so not an option), (2, 3), (1, 4 is a wall, so not an option), and (0, 3). Since we can move in all four directions (up, down, left, right) and considering the available empty spaces, the next possible move would be either to the right (2, 3) or up (0, 3).

Since our goal is (0, 1), moving up is the direction that generally leads towards the goal position.

Therefore, my next move is to the position (0, 3).

Please let me know if this is correct and present the updated maze for the next step!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll analyze the current situation again. 

The current player position (0, 3) has adjacent empty spaces at (0, 2) and no other options (the other directions are out of bounds or have walls). Since we can only move in the left direction in this case and it gets us closer to the goal (0, 1), the next possible move is to the position (0, 2).

Therefore, my next move is to the position (0, 2).

Please let me know if this is correct and present the updated maze for the next step!

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're getting close!

The current player position (0, 2) has adjacent empty spaces... well, actually none directly adjacent in the left direction (the goal direction). However, I can move to (1, 1) or other positions, but that would be moving away from the goal. Since the goal (0, 1) is right next to the current position, but separated by a wall in the direction down from (0, 1) and wall (0, 0) in the other direction, there aren't any other options in the direction of the goal other than actually being at (1, 1). No, that isn't the direction I need to go in. Wait.

In actuality I can move to the goal if I go around, but lets explore moving directly left since that is closest to our goal (even if it appears that we cannot directly go there). Upon reviewing the empty spaces available, and my path I observe that I was on the right track initially - there is no direct left (Since it's a wall at (0, 1 is the goal with a wall at (0, 0) so technically no DIRECT left since the true space that exists, left wise, is occupied by a goal)). The onlyIRECTION by pursuing is left when factoring to see if I reach and now substitute (1, 1) in this instance.

Therefore, my next move is to the position (1, 1).

Wait!, technically since left wise from (0, 2) exists a path at (0, 1). Upon knowing this from observing my YES MY NEXT MOVE IS TO (0, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

What a great follow-up question!

(1) After analyzing the original maze, I can see that the empty spaces form a general shape of an "L" (or an elbow shape). The corridors first move in one direction and then take a sharp turn to reach the goal.

(2) Here's a new maze with the same size (5x5) and the same "L" shape formed by the empty spaces:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 3)

This new maze has the same characteristics as the original one, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The empty spaces still form an "L" shape, allowing the player to navigate from the starting position to the goal.
