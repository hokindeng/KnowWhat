You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only available move from the player's initial position (1,3) is to go up. However, this is incorrect as the player can move to any adjacent empty space in the up, down, left, or right direction. In this case, the player can also move to the right.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current player position and the goal position.
The player position is (1, 3) and the goal position is (0, 1).

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current player position.
Since the player can move up, down, left, or right, we need to check which adjacent spaces are empty.

## Step 3: Check if moving up is a valid move.
The space above the player is at (1, 2), which is a wall. Therefore, moving up is not a valid move.

## Step 4: Check if moving right is a valid move.
The space to the right of the player is at (2, 3), which is an empty space. Therefore, moving right is a valid move.

## Step 5: Update the current player position based on the chosen move.
Since there's a valid move to the right, we choose to move the player to (2, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position and the goal position.
The player position is (2, 3) and the goal position is (0, 1).

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current player position.
Since the player can move up, down, left, or right, we need to check which adjacent spaces are empty.

## Step 3: Check if moving up is a valid move.
The space above the player is at (1, 3), which is an empty space. Therefore, moving up is a valid move.

## Step 4: Check if moving left is a valid move.
The space to the left of the player is at (2, 2), which is an empty space. Therefore, moving left is a valid move.

## Step 5: Check if moving right is a valid move.
The space to the right of the player is at (2, 4), which is a wall. Therefore, moving right is not a valid move.

## Step 6: Check if moving down is a valid move.
The space below the player is at (3, 3), which is a wall. Therefore, moving down is not a valid move.

## Step 7: Choose the move that progresses towards the goal.
Between moving up and left, moving left reduces the vertical distance to the goal by 1 unit, but moving up does not change the vertical distance to the goal. However, moving up sets up a path to reduce the vertical distance in the next move. We choose to move up because it maintains more flexibility for future moves.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
By examining the coordinates of the empty spaces in the original maze, we can visualize that they form a shape resembling a staircase or a series of connected L-shapes, but overall, it resembles a "" shape or more specifically a reverse "" shape. However, a more general and simplified description of the shape could be considered as a "staircase" due to its step-like progression, first moving right then down, or vice versa.


## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same size as the original, ensuring it includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces that form the same general shape.
To create a new maze with the same characteristics, we need to define a new set of coordinates for walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position, ensuring the empty spaces form a similar staircase shape but in a different configuration than the original maze.

## Step 3: Determine the size of the maze.
The original maze has dimensions that can be inferred from the coordinates provided. Since the coordinates range from (0,0) to (4,4), the maze size is 5x5.


## Step 4: Plan the new maze layout.
To create a new maze with a staircase shape for the empty spaces, we must plan the layout. A possible layout could involve starting the staircase from a different starting point or changing the orientation of the staircase.


## Step 5: Define the new maze.
Given the constraints and requirements, a new maze can be defined with the following characteristics:

- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- Empty: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)
- Player position: (3, 3)
- Goal: (0, 4)

Note that the new maze maintains the same 5x5 size, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and the empty spaces form a similar shape to the original maze but are not an identical copy.

The final answer is:

- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- Empty: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)
- Player position: (3, 3)
- Goal: (0, 4)
