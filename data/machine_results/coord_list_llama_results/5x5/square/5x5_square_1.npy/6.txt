You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution suggests moving to (2,3) next, aiming to eventually reach the goal. However, this move, although valid in terms of immediate adjacency and space emptiness, does not consider the optimal path or the actual reachability of the goal from the new position given the maze's layout. The oversight is in not realizing that moving to (2,3) does not bring the player closer to the goal in a way that leads to a solution. The goal is at (0,1), and moving down or staying at the same y-coordinate does not facilitate reaching the goal.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the layout of the maze.
The maze is a 5x5 grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P) at (1, 3), and a goal position (G) at (0, 1). The coordinates of walls and empty spaces are given.

## Step 2: Identify all possible moves from the current player position.
From (1, 3), the possible adjacent empty spaces to move to are limited by the presence of walls and the boundaries of the maze. We must examine each option to ensure it is not a wall and is within the confines of the maze.

## Step 3: Choose the best next move towards the goal.
The optimal strategy is to move closer to the goal at (0, 1) while avoiding walls and ensuring we only move through empty spaces. Given the direct path is blocked by walls, we need to find an alternative route that allows us to eventually reach (0, 1).

## Step 4: Determine the optimal immediate move.
Given the layout and the goal to reach (0, 1), moving directly towards the goal is not possible due to the wall at (1, 2) and other blocking walls. However, to approach the goal's location, moving to an adjacent empty space that brings us closer or offers further options is necessary. The player should aim to move in a direction that facilitates reaching the goal position through a viable path.

## Step 5: Execute the move.
Given the constraints and the objective to move closer to (0, 1), it becomes apparent that the initial approach was overly simplistic and didn't fully consider the maze's challenges. A more strategic approach is needed, but given the strict format and instructions provided, it seems there might be an oversight in directly providing a one-move solution without fully detailing the path to the goal due to the maze's design. However, the correct immediate move, avoiding the original mistake, would consider a broader strategy likely involving retracing steps or finding a less direct path to circumvent the walls. But without detailing the full path to the goal, the next step should be reassessed for direct goal approachability, which, based on the initial error, suggests a reconsideration of the maze's structure for a viable path to (0, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original request asks to identify the shape formed by the corridors in the given maze and then generate a new maze of the same size where the corridors form the same shape but with a different layout.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the shape formed by the corridors in the original maze.
Upon examining the empty spaces provided in the original maze, it appears that the corridors form a "Z" shape. This is observed by tracing a path from the player's position (1, 3) through the available empty spaces towards the goal (0, 1), noting how one must navigate in a zigzag pattern.

## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with the corridors forming the same "Z" shape but with a different layout.
To meet the criteria, the new maze must have the same 5x5 grid size, include a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, not be an identical copy of the original maze, and have its corridors form a recognizable "Z" shape.

## Step 3: Determine the new maze's layout.
Given the constraints and objectives, we will create a new maze that mirrors the original in terms of the shape formed by the corridors but differs in the specific placements of walls and empty spaces.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze.
The new maze's layout, adhering to the specified format and requirements, will have walls and empty spaces arranged such that they form a "Z" shape, facilitating a path from the player's new position to the goal. However, the precise coordinates of walls and empty spaces will differ from the original to meet the uniqueness criterion.

## Step 5: Present the new maze.
Without a visual interface, the new maze's layout will be described in terms of the coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the player's position, and the goal, all within a 5x5 grid.

## Step 6: Specify the new maze's details:
- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)
- Player position: (2, 3)
- Goal: (3, 1)

This new maze maintains the "Z" shape formed by the corridors, offers a valid path from the player to the goal, and differs from the original maze in layout.

The final answer is:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)
