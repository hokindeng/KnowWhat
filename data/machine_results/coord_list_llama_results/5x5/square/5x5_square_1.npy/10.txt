You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is at (1, 3), and the goal position is at (0, 1). I can see that there are empty spaces at (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3) that I can potentially move to.

However, I notice that the goal position is located above and to the left of my current position. I should prioritize moving left or up to get closer to the goal.

Considering the available empty spaces, my next move will be to the left, to the position (1, 2). However, since (1, 2) is a wall, I will instead move up and left, but that is not possible, so I will move up is not possible either, I will move down is not a good idea, I will move left and down would be moving away from the goal, so the best move is to move left  and up is not possible, the next best is just move up, no, I can do better, I will move to the best position possible,  move up and...  actually I can only move left.

My next move coordinates will be: (1, 2) no, (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

I'm currently at (2, 3), and I see that the empty space (2, 2) is adjacent to me, as well as (1, 3) However, moving to (1, 3) will be going back , and the goal is located at (0, 1). Since the empty space (2, 2) is the closest to the left and also closer to the goal and is left from where I am now I will move to that space next left.

My next move coordinates will be: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

I'm currently at (2, 2), and I see that the empty spaces (2, 1), (2, 3), and (1, 3),  are adjacent to me. However, the goal is located at (0, 1), which is above and to the left of my current position.

Since I need to move closer to the goal, I'll choose the empty space that is closer to the goal. The best option is to move up or left. Given my current position, I will move to the position that is left (2,1).

My next move coordinates will be: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

I'm currently at (2, 1), and I see that the empty spaces (1, 1) is adjacent to me, and also is the closest position to the goal on the left.

Since I need to move closer to the goal, my next move will be to (1, 1).

My next move coordinates will be: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

I'm currently at (1, 1), and I see that there is an empty space above me at position that would be the goal (0, 1).

However, that empty space is the goal itself. Since I need to move to the goal, my next move will be up.

My next move coordinates will be: (0, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L" shape

The corridors form an L shape that allows the player to navigate from the starting point to the goal.

Here is a new maze with the same size and an "L" shape formed by the empty spaces:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Note that this new maze meets the criteria, having the same size, a valid path from P to G, and an "L" shape formed by the empty spaces. It is not an identical copy of the original maze.
