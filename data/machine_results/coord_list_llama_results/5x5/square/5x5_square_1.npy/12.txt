You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the player can move freely in the up or left direction from their current position. However, it neglects to consider the walls surrounding the player. Directly moving up to (0, 3) is a correct attempt, but the subsequent plan to continue moving up and then left without properly analyzing the maze's structure and the wall's placement at (0, 4) and the lack of empty space at (0, 0) shows a lack of foresight. A more accurate approach involves recognizing the constraints imposed by the walls and finding an alternative route that respects these boundaries.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current player position
The current player position is at coordinates (1, 3).

## Step 2: Examine the maze for available moves from the current position
Given the maze layout, we can see that from the current player position (1, 3), the available moves are to the left or right, as moving up to (0, 3) is indeed possible but it needs further evaluation.

## Step 3: Plan a path towards the goal
After analyzing the maze structure and given that moving directly towards the goal is not feasible due to the presence of walls and the specific placement of empty spaces, we need to explore alternative paths that navigate through the empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 4: Identify a viable next step
Since moving to (0, 3) is an option, but continuing upwards from there is blocked by a wall at (0, 4) and the goal position (0, 1) is not directly accessible from (0, 3) due to the wall at (0, 0), we need to reconsider our approach. A viable alternative is moving left from (1, 3) into the empty space at (1, 2), navigating around restrictions.

## Step 5: Verify the move and adjust if necessary
Considering the layout, moving to (1, 2) would not lead us closer to our goal in a straightforward manner due to the error in initial planning. The correct path involves finding a more navigable route to the goal, which requires a better analysis of the maze's layout and restrictions.

## Step 6: Execute the move.
The correct move, after thorough analysis, should aim at minimizing the distance to the goal while adhering to the maze's constraints. Moving to an open space that allows for further navigation towards the goal is essential.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Upon examining the original maze, the empty spaces appear to form a shape that can be described as an "L-shape" with an additional corridor, but due to the limited structure and specific placement, it's more accurate to focus on the primary path it suggests which somewhat resembles a simplified "L" or an angular path.

## Step 2: Determine the correct description of the shape considering the provided example.
Given the context, the shape could be more precisely described by focusing on its overall form, but for simplicity and aligning with basic geometric descriptions, we'll consider it as forming a path that allows navigation from P to G.

## Step 3: Create a new maze of the same size with a similar shape for the empty spaces.
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we must ensure it's the same size (5x5), has a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and the empty spaces form a similar recognizable shape.

## Step 4: Define the new maze's walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal.
Considering the constraints, a new maze that fits within the same 5x5 grid, with a similar aim to form a path for navigation, would need strategically placed walls and empty spaces. Given the limited and specific nature of the original maze's path, we'll create a maze that offers a clear path but maintains a unique layout.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original.
- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
- Player position: (2, 1)
- Goal: (1, 3)

## Step 6: Verify the new maze's criteria.
The new maze has the same 5x5 size, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original, and its empty spaces form a path similar in simplicity but distinct in layout.

The final answer is:

Maze Shape: Angular path/L-shape variation

New Maze:
- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
- Player position: (2, 1)
- Goal: (1, 3)
