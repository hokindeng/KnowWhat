You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution suggests moving to (2,3) next, aiming to eventually reach the goal. However, this move, although valid in terms of immediate adjacency and space emptiness, does not consider the optimal path or the actual reachability of the goal from the new position given the maze's layout. The oversight is in not realizing that moving to (2,3) does not bring the player closer to the goal in a way that leads to a solution. The goal is at (0,1), and moving down or staying at the same y-coordinate does not facilitate reaching the goal.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the layout of the maze.
The maze is a 5x5 grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P) at (1, 3), and a goal position (G) at (0, 1). The coordinates of walls and empty spaces are given.

## Step 2: Identify all possible moves from the current player position.
From (1, 3), the possible adjacent empty spaces to move to are limited by the presence of walls and the boundaries of the maze. We must examine each option to ensure it is not a wall and is within the confines of the maze.

## Step 3: Choose the best next move towards the goal.
The optimal strategy is to move closer to the goal at (0, 1) while avoiding walls and ensuring we only move through empty spaces. Given the direct path is blocked by walls, we need to find an alternative route that allows us to eventually reach (0, 1).

## Step 4: Determine the optimal immediate move.
Given the layout and the goal to reach (0, 1), moving directly towards the goal is not possible due to the wall at (1, 2) and other blocking walls. However, to approach the goal's location, moving to an adjacent empty space that brings us closer or offers further options is necessary. The player should aim to move in a direction that facilitates reaching the goal position through a viable path.

## Step 5: Execute the move.
Given the constraints and the objective to move closer to (0, 1), it becomes apparent that the initial approach was overly simplistic and didn't fully consider the maze's challenges. A more strategic approach is needed, but given the strict format and instructions provided, it seems there might be an oversight in directly providing a one-move solution without fully detailing the path to the goal due to the maze's design. However, the correct immediate move, avoiding the original mistake, would consider a broader strategy likely involving retracing steps or finding a less direct path to circumvent the walls. But without detailing the full path to the goal, the next step should be reassessed for direct goal approachability, which, based on the initial error, suggests a reconsideration of the maze's structure for a viable path to (0, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original response does not provide a solution to analyze.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Upon examination of the original maze's empty spaces: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), it appears the shape resembles a simple, not fully connected path but can be best described as forming an 'L' shape with additional disconnected segments. However, considering the primary path that can be utilized, it leans more towards an 'L' shape when focusing on the connectivity from the player's starting position to the potential path towards the goal.

## Step 2: Design a new maze of the same size with the same general shape of empty spaces but ensure it's not identical.
To create a new maze with the same 'L' shaped path characteristic, we must ensure that the path from the player's position (P) to the goal (G) is achievable through a similar 'L' shaped corridor but in a different configuration within the maze. We'll adjust the positions of the walls and empty spaces to create this new maze while maintaining the 5x5 grid size.

## Step 3: Encode the new maze in the same format as the original.
The new maze will have the player position (P) and goal position (G) adjusted to accommodate the new path. We'll place P at a position that allows for movement through the 'L' shaped corridor towards G, which will be positioned at the end of the 'L' shape.

## Step 4: Finalize the new maze's coordinates for walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position.
Given the constraints and objectives, let's configure the new maze with an 'L' shaped path of empty spaces, from the standpoint of providing a similar structure to navigate through, and to reach the goal in a manner that mirrors the original maze's intent.

The final answer is:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 3)
