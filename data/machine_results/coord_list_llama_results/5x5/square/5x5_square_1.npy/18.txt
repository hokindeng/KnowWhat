You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position is (1, 3), and the goal position is (0, 1).

I will examine the adjacent coordinates to the current position (1, 3):

- Up: (1, 4) is a wall.
- Down: (1, 2) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 3) is an empty space.
- Right: (2, 3) is an empty space.

Since I can move to any empty space adjacent to the current position, my next move will be to (2, 3) as it is closer to an empty space (2, 2) that leads to (2, 1) and then possibly (1, 1), which in turn can lead to the goal (0, 1).

My next move is to the coordinates (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the possible moves from the current position (2, 3).

I will examine the adjacent coordinates to the current position (2, 3):

- Up: (2, 4) is a wall.
- Down: There is no space below, out of bounds.
 Not actually,  (2, 2) is an empty space.
- Left: (1, 3) is an empty space.
- Right: (3, 3) is a wall.

Since I can move to any empty space adjacent to the current position, my next move will be to (2, 2) as it is closer to (2, 1), which in turn can lead to (1, 1) and then possibly to the goal (0, 1).

My next move is to the coordinates (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the possible moves from the current position (2, 2).

I will examine the adjacent coordinates to the current position (2, 2):

- Up: (2, 3) is an empty space.
- Down: (2, 1) is an empty space.
- Left: (1, 2) is a wall.
- Right: (3, 2) is a wall.

Since I can move to any empty space adjacent to the current position, my next move will be to (2, 1) as it is closer to (1, 1), which in turn can lead to the goal (0, 1).

My next move is to the coordinates (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the possible moves from the current position (2, 1).

I will examine the adjacent coordinates to the current position (2, 1):

- Up: (2, 2) is an empty space.
- Down: (2, 0) is a wall.
- Left: (1, 1) is an empty space.
- Right: (3, 1) is a wall.

Since I can move to any empty space adjacent to the current position, my next move will be to (1, 1) as it is closer to the goal (0, 1).

My next move is to the coordinates (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the possible moves from the current position (1, 1).

I will examine the adjacent coordinates to the current position (1, 1):

- Up: (1, 2) is a wall, however (1, 0) is a wall, and also these moves don't bring us to goal.
- Down:  there isn't space below (1, 1).
- Left: (0, 1) is the goal.
- Right: (2, 1) is an empty space but it leads us away from the goal.

Since I can move to any empty space adjacent to the current position, my next move will be to (0, 1) as it is the goal.

My next move is to the coordinates (0, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "L-Shape" or "Angled Corridor"

The corridors in the original maze form an L-shape, with a horizontal segment and a vertical segment that meet at a corner.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. It is not an identical copy of the original maze, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-Shape or Angled Corridor.
