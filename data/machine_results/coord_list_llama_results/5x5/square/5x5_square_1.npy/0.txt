You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. 

First, I need to analyze the current player position (1, 3) and find possible adjacent empty spaces to move into. The empty spaces adjacent to (1, 3) are limited due to the walls, but one option directly above it is (1, 2), which is a wall, another option is directly below it, which doesn't exist as an empty space, and then there are options directly left or right. Since (1, 2) is a wall, the only viable empty space I see that is adjacent and can be moved to is not directly listed but by analyzing the empty spaces given and considering the grid layout, moving left from (1, 3) to (1, 1) seems like the best immediate option since it is an empty space that allows further movement potentially towards the goal.

However, considering my explanation, my next move should indeed be a viable adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal or offers further movement options. Given the analysis, moving to (1, 1) initially appears as the only viable step from (1, 3) considering the restrictions presented by the walls and aiming for further movements that could lead closer to the goal.

But let's explicitly consider each direction from (1, 3):
- Moving up to (1, 2) is blocked by a wall.
- Moving down to (1, 4) is blocked by a wall and is also not an empty space listed.
- Moving right from (1, 3) would mean moving into (1, 4) which is a wall and not listed as an empty space.
- Moving left to (1, 2) is blocked, but moving further left to (1, 1) is possible as mentioned.

Given this more detailed analysis, my stated intention to move to an adjacent empty space is confirmed with a scrutinized approach considering all four directions from the current player position, which positively indicates moving leftwards towards an empty space as the only viable option, hence moving to (1, 1) remains the immediate next move under the given conditions and the strategic aim of reaching the goal by avoiding walls and moving through empty spaces.

Move to (1, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is an "L-Shape".

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces forming an L-Shape:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (0, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)

This new maze maintains the L-Shape formed by the empty spaces while providing a new challenge with different wall placements. The player can navigate from the player position (P) to the goal position (G) using the empty spaces.
