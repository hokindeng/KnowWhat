You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is at (1, 3), and the goal position is at (0, 1). I can see that there are empty spaces at (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3) that I can potentially move to.

However, I notice that the goal position is located above and to the left of my current position. I should prioritize moving left or up to get closer to the goal.

Considering the available empty spaces, my next move will be to the left, to the position (1, 2). However, since (1, 2) is a wall, I will instead move up and left, but that is not possible, so I will move up is not possible either, I will move down is not a good idea, I will move left and down would be moving away from the goal, so the best move is to move left  and up is not possible, the next best is just move up, no, I can do better, I will move to the best position possible,  move up and...  actually I can only move left.

My next move coordinates will be: (1, 2) no, (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

The player position is now at (2, 3), and the goal position remains at (0, 1). I can see that there are empty spaces at (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 1), and (1, 3) that I can potentially move to.

To move closer to the goal, I should prioritize moving up or left. Considering the available empty spaces, I can move up or left to (2, 2) or (2, 1)  but left to (2, 2) is more favorable because it is in the general direction of the goal but the most direct route would be to (1,3).

My next move coordinates will be: (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll plan my next move.

The player position is now at (2, 2), and the goal position remains at (0, 1). I can see that there are empty spaces at (2, 1), (2, 3), (1, 1), and (1, 3) that I can potentially move to.

To move closer to the goal, I should prioritize moving up or left. Considering the available empty spaces, I can move left to (2, 1). This move will bring me closer to the left edge of the maze, which is in the general direction of the goal.

My next move coordinates will be: (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze.

The player position is now at (2, 1), and the goal position remains at (0, 1). I can see that there are empty spaces at (1, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3), (1,3)  that I can potentially move to.

Since I'm already in the correct column (1) as the goal, I should prioritize moving up to get closer to the goal.

My next move coordinates will be: (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll plan my next move.

The player position is now at (1, 1), and the goal position is just above me at (0, 1). However, I notice that (0, 1) is not directly accessible due to the wall at (0, 0) and (1, 0),  the closest empty space is (0, 2) or (0,3) but I would rather move (1, 3) and then (0, 3), (0, 2) so I will move right and up.

My next move coordinates will be: (1, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "staircase".

Here is a new maze with the same size, but with a different configuration of walls and empty spaces, still forming a staircase shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (3 is not valid,  so) (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 3)
