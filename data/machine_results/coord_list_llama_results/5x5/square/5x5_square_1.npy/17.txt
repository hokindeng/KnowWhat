You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position is (1, 3), and the goal position is (0, 1).

Available empty spaces adjacent to the current position are: 
- Up: (1, 2) is a wall; not a valid move.
- Down: (1, 4) is a wall; not a valid move.
- Left: (0, 3) is an empty space; a valid move.
- Right: (2, 3) is an empty space; a valid move.

Since we need to move towards the goal position (0, 1), the best move is to go left, to (0, 3).

My next move is: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position is (0, 3), and the goal position is (0, 1).

Available empty spaces adjacent to the current position are: 
- Up: (0, 2) is an empty space; a valid move.
- Down: (0, 4) is a wall; not a valid move.
- Left: No valid space (out of bounds).
- Right: No valid space (out of bounds).

Since we need to move towards the goal position (0, 1), the best move is to go up, to (0, 2).

My next move is: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position is (0, 2), and the goal position is (0, 1).

Available empty spaces adjacent to the current position are: 
- Up: No valid space (goal is directly adjacent).
- Down: (0, 3) is an empty space; but it is moving away from the goal.
- Left: No valid space (out of bounds).
- Right: No valid space is better than moving up.

Since the goal position (0, 1) is directly adjacent to the current position, the best move is to go up, to (0, 1).

My next move is: (0, 1)

This move should reach the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "L-Shape"

The empty spaces in the original maze form a rough L-shape, with a horizontal segment connected to a vertical segment.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 3)

This new maze meets the criteria:

* It has the same size as the original maze (5x5).
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces.
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze.
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-Shape.
