You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution suggests moving to (2,3) first, assuming it's the nearest empty space to the goal. However, this is incorrect because (2,3) is not necessarily the best first step towards the goal (0,1). A better approach is to try to move directly towards the goal or explore the nearest empty spaces that could potentially lead to the goal more efficiently.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout and goal position.
The maze layout, including walls and empty spaces, needs to be evaluated again to find a more efficient path to the goal (0,1) from the player's position (1,3).

## Step 2: Identify all possible moves from the current position.
Possible moves are to empty spaces adjacent to the current position (1,3). These include moving up to (0,3), down to (2,3), left to no valid space due to a wall, or right to no valid space due to the edge of the maze.

## Step 3: Evaluate which possible move is closest to the goal or part of a potential path.
Among the possible moves, (0,3) seems promising because it's directly above the current position, reducing the vertical distance to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the best move based on proximity to the goal and potential for future moves.
Moving up to (0,3) is a logical first step since it's closer to the goal vertically and does not increase the horizontal distance from the goal, keeping options open for the next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Evaluate the current position and the goal position.
The player is at (0,3) and needs to get to (0,1), which is two spaces to the left.

## Step 2: Identify any obstacles or walls between the current position and the goal.
There are no walls directly between the player's current position (0,3) and the goal (0,1), but there is a wall at (0,0) which does not affect this move since the goal is at (0,1).

## Step 3: Consider the nearest empty spaces that could lead to the goal.
Since the goal is two spaces to the left, the immediate space to the left of the player (0,2) is a critical step towards reaching the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the best move based on proximity to the goal and potential for future moves.
Moving to (0,2) is the logical next step because it is directly on the path to the goal, closer than the current position, and leads directly to the goal with one more move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Evaluate the current position and the goal position.
The player is at (0,2) and needs to get to (0,1), which is one space to the left.

## Step 2: Identify any obstacles or walls between the current position and the goal.
There are no walls directly between the player's current position (0,2) and the goal (0,1).

## Step 3: Consider the nearest empty spaces that could lead to the goal.
Since the goal is immediately to the left of the current position and there are no obstacles, the goal itself is the nearest relevant space.

## Step 4: Choose the best move based on proximity to the goal and potential for future moves.
Moving to (0,1) is the only logical next step as it is the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  1\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Based on the coordinates of the empty spaces in the original maze, it appears to form a shape that can be described as an "L-shape" or "Elbow-shape", with a primarily vertical section connected to a shorter horizontal section.

## Step 2: Design a new maze of the same size that incorporates the same general shape for its empty spaces.
To create a new maze, the walls and empty spaces need to be rearranged to form a different layout while maintaining an L-shape or Elbow-shape configuration for the empty spaces.

## Step 3: Ensure the new maze has a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces.
The new maze must allow for a path through its empty spaces from a designated start position (P) to a designated goal position (G), without being an identical copy of the original maze.

## Step 4: Provide the new maze encoded in the same format as the original.
Given the constraints of the problem, a new maze is created with the walls and empty spaces rearranged to form a new L-shape or Elbow-shape, ensuring a valid path exists from P to G.

New Maze:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

The final answer is: The general shape is an L-shape or Elbow-shape. The new maze is provided in the format specified above.
