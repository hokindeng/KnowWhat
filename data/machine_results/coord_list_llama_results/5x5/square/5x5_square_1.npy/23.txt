You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

From the current player position (1, 3), I can move:

* Up: Not possible, as there is a wall at (1, 0) and (1, 2).
* Down: Not possible, as there is a wall at (1, 4).
* Left: Possible, as there is an empty space at (1, 2) adjacent to the current position, but there's also a wall at (1, 2) diagonally. However, since I can move to (1, 2) by going left and then try to move up, I will first try to move left to (1, 2).
* Right: Not possible, as there is no empty space on the right.

Since moving left seems to be the most promising option, my next move will be to (1, 2).

However, after re-reading my analysis and the maze description, I realized that I said (1, 2) has a wall. This is correct. This invalidates the move I was going to make to the left. 

Considering the maze again from the player's position at (1, 3), I see that moving to the left isn't a possibility because of the wall at (1, 2).

Considering all possible directions from (1, 3) again:

* Up isn't possible.
* Down isn't possible.
* Left isn't possible.
* Right is the only option left. I noticed that (2, 3) isn't listed as a wall, and that spot is currently empty.

My next move is to (2, 3).

I will wait for the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (2, 3).

From the current player position (2, 3), I can move:

* Up: Not possible, as there are walls at (2, 0) and (2, 4) and I also can't move to a non-empty space.
* Down: Not possible, as there is a wall at (2, 4).
* Left: Possible, as there is an empty space at (2, 2) adjacent to the current position.
* Right: Not possible, as there is no empty space on the right.

Since moving left seems to be the most promising option, my next move will be to (2, 2).

I will wait for the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (2, 2).

From the current player position (2, 2), I can move:

* Up: Not possible, as there are walls at (2, 0) and (2, 0) isn't part of the empty spaces either.
* Down: Possible, as there is an empty space at (2, 3) adjacent to the current position.
* Left: Possible, as there is an empty space at (2, 1) adjacent to the current position.
* Right: Not possible, as there is no empty space on the right.

Between the two possible moves, moving down to (2, 3) seems to not bring me closer to the goal (0, 1), as that path is already known. 

Moving left to (2, 1) brings me closer to (1, 1) which then brings me closer to (0, 1), so that's the best option for my next move.

My next move will be to (2, 1).

I will wait for the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (2, 1).

From the current player position (2, 1), I can move:

* Up: Not possible, as there is a wall at (2, 0).
* Down: Not possible, as there are walls at (3, 1).
* Left: Possible, as there is an empty space at (1, 1) adjacent to the current position.
* Right: Possible, as there is an empty space at (2, 2) adjacent to the current position.

Between the two possible moves, moving right to (2, 2) doesn't bring me closer to the goal (0, 1), as that is moving away from the goal in the x-direction.

Moving left to (1, 1) brings me closer to the goal (0, 1), so that's the best option for my next move.

My next move will be to (1, 1).

I will wait for the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (1, 1).

From the current player position (1, 1), I can move:

* Up: Not possible, as there is a wall at (1, 0).
* Down: Not possible, as there are walls at (1, 2) and (1, 4), but there is an empty space at (1, 3) that I can move to later.
* Left: Not immediately possible, as there is a wall at (0, 0), however I do see an empty space at (0, 2) and another empty space at (0, 3), which would mean there is a clear path of empty spaces from (0, 3) or (0, 2) to the goal (0, 1) via a y-direction move down.
* Right: Possible, as there is an empty space at (2, 1) adjacent to the current position.

Between the two possible moves, moving right to (2, 1) would undo my last step, moving me away from the goal again. Instead, I will try to work towards reaching the left area (x = 0) of the maze, because that's where my goal position (0, 1) is.

Since moving down is an option and that area doesn't have a wall blocking my path to x = 0, I can try moving down first to reach either (0, 3) or (0, 2) to move left afterwards.

My next move will be to (1, 3).

I will wait for the updated maze.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "L-Shape" or " Zig-Zag L-Shape", as the corridors initially lead downwards and then take a sharp turn to the left.

Here's a new maze that meets the specified criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 0) Wait, (0,0) is blocked by a wall. 

(2) Let us redefine walls, empty, player position and goal.

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 0)

Note that while I used some guessing and inefficient movements to navigate the first maze, the general L-shape should be easier to identify in this one. The important point is that the empty spaces still form an L-Shape, as they do in the original maze.

Having reached the goal, you can tweak those wall and empty spaces to make that still works but is a more challenging variant of the initial maze, as you can redirect the shape so that L could go right or as if reaching either up or down over multiple rows and after right the more normal non horizontal other rows will be able to capture the movement within this limited area
