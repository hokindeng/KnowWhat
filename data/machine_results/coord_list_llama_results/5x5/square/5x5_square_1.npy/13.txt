You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

Since I am at position (1, 3) and my goal is (0, 1), I need to move upwards and to the left. However, I am blocked by a wall above me, so I will first move to the left.

My next move will be to position (1, 2), but that is a wall. So, I will move down is also not an option since I need to go up to reach the goal. I can move to the position (2, 3) to the right, which is an empty space.

My next move will be to position (2, 3), then I can move up, and then left to reach the goal.



The coordinates of my next move are (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2, 3) and I need to move up and to the left to reach the goal. Since there is an empty space above me is not available, I will try to move to the left.

My next move will be to position (2, 2), which is an empty space. From there, I can reassess the situation and plan my next move.



The coordinates of my next move are (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2, 2) and I need to move up and to the left to reach the goal. Since I'm still blocked by a wall on my left, I will move up.

My next move will be to position (1, 2), but that's a wall. So I'll try to move to the position above and slightly to the left of my current position.



My next move will be to position (1, 3) left was obstructed and only up was available by one space left more than original up, along with that up has empty.



However since up is actually to the left, to a certain extent, and it may put us closer to where we need to be:



The coordinates of my next move are (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (1, 3) and I need to move up and to the left to reach the goal. Since there is an empty space to my left, I will move left and up.



My next move will be to position (1, 2) no since, there is a wall. so,



My next move will be to position (1, 1) that is, to the left and from there I can move up left,



However another plausible Idea to consider is (0,3) going to direct left above



The coordinates of my next move are (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0, 3) and the goal is at (0, 1), which means I need to move down the row to reach the goal.

Since there is an empty space to my left at (0, 2), I will move to that position next.



The coordinates of my next move are (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0, 2) and the goal is at (0, 1), which is just one step to my left.

I will move to the goal position.



The coordinates of my next move are (0, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag staircase" or a " staggered diagonal line".


Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (1, 1)


This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and forms a zig-zag staircase or staggered diagonal line shape with its empty spaces. It is not an identical copy of the original maze.
