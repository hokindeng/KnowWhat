You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the player can move freely in the up or left direction from their current position (1, 3) to reach the goal. However, the actual movement should be more carefully planned to ensure that the player stays within the empty spaces and avoids walls. In this case, the player cannot move left from (1, 3) because there is a wall at (1, 2) and no empty space directly left of the player.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a player position, and a goal position. The coordinates (0,0) denote the top left corner. The player can move up, down, left, or right to empty spaces.

## Step 2: Analyze the player position and goal
The player is at (1, 3) and needs to get to the goal at (0, 1).

## Step 3: Determine the possible moves from the current position
From (1, 3), the player can only move up to (1, 2) but it's a wall, so the only option is to move up is not possible. However, since (2, 3) is an empty space, moving down to (2, 3) is a viable move.

## Step 4: Choose the move that brings the player closer to the goal
The player will choose to move down to (2, 3).

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the chosen move
The player moves to (2, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The previous solution correctly navigated the player to (2, 3). However, the next step requires a new analysis based on the updated maze.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a player position, and a goal position. The coordinates (0,0) denote the top left corner. The player can move up, down, left, or right to empty spaces.

## Step 2: Analyze the player position and goal
The player is at (2, 3) and needs to get to the goal at (0, 1).

## Step 3: Determine the possible moves from the current position
From (2, 3), the player can move left to (2, 2) which is an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the move that brings the player closer to the goal
The player will choose to move left to (2, 2).

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the chosen move
The player moves to (2, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

The maze has walls, empty spaces, a player position, and a goal position. The coordinates (0,0) denote the top left corner. The player can move up, down, left, or right to empty spaces.

## Step 2: Analyze the player position and goal
The player is at (2, 2) and needs to get to the goal at (0, 1).

## Step 3: Determine the possible moves from the current position
From (2, 2), the player can move left to (2, 1) which is an empty space, or move up to (1, 2) but it's a wall, so moving up is not possible.

## Step 4: Choose the move that brings the player closer to the goal
The player will choose to move left to (2, 1).

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the chosen move
The player moves to (2, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  1\right)}$

## Step 2: Analyze the player position and goal
The player is at (1, 1) and needs to get to the goal at (0, 1).

## Step 3: Determine the possible moves from the current position
From (1, 1), the player can move left to (0, 1) which is the goal, but first, we need to check if it's a valid move by checking if (0, 1) is not a wall and it's empty, which is not explicitly listed as empty but we can infer it because it's the goal and goals are not walls.

## Step 4: Choose the move that brings the player closer to the goal
The player will choose to move left to (0, 1).

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the chosen move
The player moves to (0, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  1\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The original maze has empty spaces that form a general "L" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with empty spaces that form the same "L" shape, meeting the specified criteria.
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we will mirror the original maze's empty spaces along the y-axis (vertical axis) while keeping the same overall "L" shape.


The final answer is: 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)
