You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the player can move freely in the up or left direction from their current position (1, 3) to reach the goal. However, the actual movement should be more carefully planned to ensure that the player stays within the empty spaces and avoids walls. In this case, the player cannot move left from (1, 3) because there is a wall at (1, 2) and no empty space directly left of the player.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a player position, and a goal position. The coordinates (0,0) denote the top left corner. The player can move up, down, left, or right to empty spaces.

## Step 2: Analyze the player position and goal
The player is at (1, 3) and needs to get to the goal at (0, 1).

## Step 3: Determine the possible moves from the current position
From (1, 3), the player can only move up to (1, 2) but it's a wall, so the only option is to move up is not possible. However, since (2, 3) is an empty space, moving down to (2, 3) is a viable move.

## Step 4: Choose the move that brings the player closer to the goal
The player will choose to move down to (2, 3).

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the chosen move
The player moves to (2, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The previous solution was a correct step towards solving the maze, and we continue with the next move from the current position.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
The maze layout has been updated with the new player position, but the goal remains the same.

## Step 2: Analyze the player position and goal
The player is now at (2, 3) and still needs to get to the goal at (0, 1).

## Step 3: Determine the possible moves from the current position
From (2, 3), the player can only move up to (2, 2) since (2, 2) is an empty space, or left to (1, 3) also an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the move that brings the player closer to the goal
Moving left to (1, 3) seems like it doesn't bring us closer to the goal in terms of x-coordinate, but moving up and then left could. However, since the goal has an x-coordinate of 0, and there are no empty spaces directly above (0,3) and left, left does not make sense. So we should go up to (2,2).

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the chosen move
The player moves up to (2, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
The maze layout has been updated with the new player position, and the goal remains the same.

## Step 2: Analyze the player position and goal
The player is now at (2, 2) and needs to get to the goal at (0, 1).

## Step 3: Determine the possible moves from the current position
From (2, 2), the player can only move up but (2,1) and (1,2) is in the possibilities since (2,1) and (1,2)  have different issues: (2,1) is a good place, (1,2) is a wall and we can't go there, left is not possible either, right puts us in a wall and down puts us in the previous place.

## Step 4: Choose the move that brings the player closer to the goal
Moving to (2,1) seems the best option since it keeps us closer to the 0 column where the goal is.

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the chosen move
The player moves to (2, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  1\right)}$

## Step 3: Determine the possible moves from the current position
From (2, 1), the player can move up but it will take them away from the goal in terms of column or left to (1, 1), which seems the most viable option.

## Step 4: Choose the move that brings the player closer to the goal
Moving to (1, 1) brings the player closer to the goal in terms of column.

The player moves to (1, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  1\right)}$

Moving to (0, 1) directly brings the player to the goal.

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the chosen move
The player moves to (0, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The original maze has empty spaces that form a shape which appears to be an irregular path with multiple turns, resembling an "L" shape with an additional arm extending from the middle.

## Step 2: Determine the name of the shape.
Given the irregularity and the specifics of the path, it doesn't fit a simple geometric shape like a line, square, or circle. It's more complex and can be described as an "L" shape with an extension, but for simplicity, we can call it an "Extended L" shape.

## Step 3: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same shape.
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we'll rearrange the walls and empty spaces while maintaining the "Extended L" shape formed by the corridors. We'll ensure it's not an identical copy and that there's a valid path from P to G.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original.
Given the original maze's size and the need to form an "Extended L" shape, here's a new maze configuration:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 3)

The final answer is:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 3)
