You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. 

First, I need to analyze the current player position (1, 3) and find possible moves. The adjacent positions to (1, 3) are:

Up: (1, 2) - wall, not a valid move
Down: (1, 4) - wall, not a valid move
Left: (0, 3) - empty space, valid move
Right: (2, 3) - empty space, valid move

Considering the two valid options, I'll choose the one that seems more promising, which is (2, 3). This is because moving to (2, 3) gives me more potential options for the next move.

My next move is to (2, 3).

Please update the maze and let me know the outcome.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 3), I need to find possible moves. The adjacent positions to (2, 3) are:

Up: (2, 2) - empty space, valid move
Down: (2, 4) - wall, not a valid move
Left: (1, 3) - empty space, but I just came from there, so it's not a good choice
Right: (3, 3) - wall, not a valid move

I'll choose to move up to (2, 2). This position is closer to the goal, and it also gives me options for the next move.

My next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 2), I'll analyze the adjacent positions:

Up: (2, 1) - empty space, valid move
Down: (2, 3) - empty space, but I just came from there, so it's not a good choice
Left: (1, 2) - wall, not a valid move
Right: (3, 2) - wall, not a valid move

I'll choose to move up to (2, 1). This position seems closer to the goal, and it might give me options for the next move.

My next move is to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 1), I'll analyze the adjacent positions:

Up: (1, 1) - empty space, valid move
Down: no valid move (out of bounds)
Left: no valid move (out of bounds)
Right: (3, 1) - wall, not a valid move

I'll choose to move up to (1, 1). This position seems closer to the goal, and it's a good option considering the current layout.

My next move is to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 1), I'll analyze the adjacent positions:

Up: (0, 1) - this is the goal position!
Down: no valid move (wall)
Left: no valid move (wall)
Right: (1, 2) - no valid move (wall)
 
My next move is to (0, 1), which is the goal position!

Did I solve the maze?

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces is an L-shape.

2. Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:
 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 3)

This new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it also forms an L-shape with the empty spaces. The player can navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.
