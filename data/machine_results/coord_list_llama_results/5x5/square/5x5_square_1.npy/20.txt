You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. 

First, let's analyze the maze:

Given the Player position: (1, 3), I can move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent empty space.

Available empty spaces around the Player position: (1, 3) are (0, 3), (1, 2) is blocked by a wall, (2, 3), and (1, 1) as moving to (1, 4) is blocked by a wall and so is (1, 0) and there is no space at (1, -1) or (0, 3) is accessible but not (-1, 3). The (2, 3) empty space seems to be a viable option and allows us to continue exploring the maze in search of the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to move to the coordinates (2, 3).

So, the next move is: (2, 3)

Please update the maze with this move and present it to me again for my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze again:

Given the Player position: (2, 3), I can move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent empty space.

Available empty spaces around the Player position: (2, 3) are (2, 2) and (1, 3). 

The options of moving to (2, 4) or (3, 3) are blocked by walls, and (2, -1) or (-1, 3) or (4, 3) don't provide viable options as the space doesn't exist within the given maze or it's blocked.

Since we're trying to reach the goal (0, 1), it seems beneficial to explore the upper part of the maze.

Therefore, my next move would be to move to the coordinates (2, 2).

However, the goal (0, 1) can be reached if we could get closer to the empty space (1, 1). Given the empty space at (1, 3), let's consider going back to (1, 3).

So, the next move is: (1, 3)

Please update the maze with this move and present it to me again for my next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the Player position: (1, 3), I'll analyze the maze again:

Since my goal is to move closer to the Goal position: (0, 1), I should try to navigate towards the upper left part of the maze.

Available empty spaces around the Player position: (1, 3) are (0, 3), (1, 1), and (2, 3). 

Since I need to move closer to the Goal position, my best option would be to move to (1, 1), which brings me closer to the goal and provides further options for movement.

Therefore, my next move would be to move to the coordinates (1, 1).

So, the next move is: (1, 1)

Please update the maze with this move and present it to me again for my next move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, a valid path from P to G, and the same L-shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors):

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)

This new maze has an L-shaped path that connects the player position (1, 3) to the goal position (0, 2), similar to the original maze. However, the wall and empty space positions have been rearranged to create a new, non-identical maze.
