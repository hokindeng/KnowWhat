You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution suggests moving to (2,3) without considering it as a viable first step due to its position relative to the goal. However, it overlooks the need to evaluate all possible moves from the current position, especially since moving right to (2,3) doesn't directly contribute to reaching the goal more efficiently than other options. The correct approach should prioritize moves that reduce the distance to the goal directly or set up a clear path towards it.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the given maze structure to understand the layout of walls, empty spaces, the player's position, and the goal position.
The maze structure shows that the player is currently at position (1, 3) and needs to reach the goal position (0, 1). The given walls and empty spaces dictate the possible paths.

## Step 2: Identify all possible moves from the current player position.
Given the maze layout, from position (1, 3), the player can move left or right since moving up is blocked by a wall, and moving down would also be into a wall or out of bounds.

## Step 3: Determine the optimal direction to move towards the goal.
To reach the goal (0,1) efficiently, the player should aim to move closer to the goal. The most direct path, while avoiding walls, involves moving left to (0,3), then up is not possible due to a wall at (0,4) and the aim is to get closer to the goal, so moving down to (1,2) would be considering the wall at (1,2), so moving left to (1,2) is not possible, moving down is also not possible, the only move left is to move up to (1,2) is not possible so the player will have to move left or right from (1,3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original problem was correctly analyzed, but the task now asks for the identification of the general shape formed by the empty spaces and the generation of a new maze with the same shape characteristics, not for a solution to the maze.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the given maze.
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that can be described as an "L" shape, with corridors extending in two directions from a corner.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same general shape but in a different orientation or position within the maze.
To create a new maze that is not an identical copy but maintains the "L" shape formed by empty spaces, we can rotate the "L" shape or mirror it. Here's a new set of coordinates that achieve this:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 3)

This new maze maintains the "L" shape but in a different orientation and position within the maze.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1. L}$
