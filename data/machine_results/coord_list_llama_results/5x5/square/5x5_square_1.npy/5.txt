You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

Since I am at position (1, 3) and my goal is (0, 1), I need to find a path that takes me closer to the goal. I will examine my surroundings and look for empty spaces adjacent to my current position.

After analyzing the maze, I notice that I can move up to position (1, 2), but it is blocked by a wall. I can also move down, but it is out of the maze boundaries. I can move left to position (0, 3), which is an empty space, or I can move right, but it is also out of the maze boundaries.

Considering my options, my next move will be to position (0, 3).

New position: (0, 3)

Please update the maze and provide the new situation. I will then plan my next move accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my current position at (0, 3), I'm one step closer to the goal.

I can move up, but it will be out of the maze boundaries. I can move down to position (1, 3), but it will take me away from the goal. I can move left, but it's a wall. I can move right to position (0, 2), which is an empty space and brings me closer to the goal.

Considering my options, my next move will be to position (0, 2).

New position: (0, 2)

Please update the maze and provide the new situation. I will then plan my next move accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my current position at (0, 2), I can see the goal is just one step away.

I can move up, but it's not possible as it is out of the maze boundaries. I can move down to position (1, 2), but it's a wall and not a valid move. I can move left to position (0, 1), which is the goal. I can move right to position (0, 3), but it's not moving closer to the goal.

Considering my options, my next move will be to position (0, 1).

New position: (0, 1)

I have reached the goal!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) L-shape

The empty spaces form a rough L-shape that connects the starting position to the goal.

Here is a new maze with the same size as the original, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

This new maze meets the criteria:

* Same size as the original maze
* Includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
* Not an identical copy of the original maze
* Forms an L-shape with its empty spaces

Note that I've changed the positions of the empty spaces to form a new maze, but the overall L-shape remains recognizable.
