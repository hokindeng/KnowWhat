You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search algorithm. I will explore all possible adjacent empty spaces from my current position and then choose the one that is closest to the goal.

From my current position (2, 4), I can move to the following adjacent empty spaces:

(1, 4) and (2, 3)

I will choose to move to (2, 3) since it is closer to the goal (2, 2).

Next move: (2, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm one step closer to the goal.

From my current position (2, 3), I can move to the following adjacent empty space:

(2, 4) or (1, 2) and (1, 3 is a wall, 2, 2) meaning (2,2) but going directly to goal but its  available empty adjacent to current space) 
 or other available one  is  (1, 2)


But since I am aiming for the goal (2, 2), and moving directly down isn't a viable option because 3,2 is a wall as I see from walls listed meaning  I can't go 3,2 , However moving diagonals aren't allowed. I will move into  (1, 2) solving assuming might provide later some path towards (2,2).

Next move: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've moved to (1, 2). Since my goal is (2, 2) and it's just one step to the right from my current position, and that position isn't blocked by a wall and becoming an empty space that was left from last  position move at (2,3) becoming  current my next move.

Next move: (2, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(zig-zag shape or a modified stairs-like structure)".


Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zig-zag shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

This new maze has a similar zig-zag shape and a valid path from P to G can be reached through empty spaces. Note that it's not an identical copy of the original maze. The path also resembles a stairs-like structure that takes you from the start to the goal.
