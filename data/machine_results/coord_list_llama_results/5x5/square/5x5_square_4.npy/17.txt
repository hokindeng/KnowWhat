You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only viable next position is down (increase y-coordinate), resulting in (2, 5), without properly considering the actual possibilities within the maze.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Determine the current player position and goal position.
The player position is given as (2, 4) and the goal position is given as (2, 2).

## Step 2: Evaluate the available movements.
We can move up, down, left, or right from the current position to an empty space. We cannot move into walls.

## Step 3: Examine the possible next positions.
Since the goal is at (2, 2), we should aim to move towards it. The most direct path would involve moving up from (2, 4) towards (2, 2).

## Step 4: Assess the feasibility of moving up.
To move up, the new position would be (2, 3), which is an empty space according to the given information.

## Step 5: Determine if (2, 3) is a viable next step.
Since (2, 3) is an empty space and directly above the current position, moving to (2, 3) would be a viable next step.

## Step 6: Consider any other potential moves.
Other potential moves would be moving left to (1, 4), which is also an empty space, but does not directly approach the goal.

## Step 7: Choose the most appropriate next step.
Moving up to (2, 3) would be the most direct approach towards the goal (2, 2) while adhering to the rules of movement through empty spaces.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "staircase".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is still a staircase. Note that I've rotated the staircase shape in this new maze for variation.
