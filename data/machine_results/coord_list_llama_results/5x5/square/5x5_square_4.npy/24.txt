You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

From the current player position (2, 4), I can move up, down, left, or right. Since the goal is (2, 2), I will prioritize moving up to reduce the y-coordinate.

Moving up from (2, 4), I see that (2, 3) is an empty space. Therefore, my next move is to (2, 3).

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (2, 3).

To reach the goal (2, 2), I should move up. However, (2, 2) is the goal itself, and I should also check if it is accessible. Since (2, 2) is not in the list of empty spaces or walls, but it is the goal, I assume it is an empty space and is accessible. I have to consider that my previous position was (2,4) then I moved up to (2,3), so now I can safely move up again.

My next move is to (2, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) L-shape

The empty spaces form a rough L-shape, with two corridors: one horizontal (top row) and one vertical (middle column).

Now, I will generate a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape. Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it has the same size and a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces, which form an L-shape.
