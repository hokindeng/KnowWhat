You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only viable next position is down (y-1), to (2, 3). However, this solution overlooks another possible move that also adheres to the constraints and is more optimal considering the overall path required to reach the goal position (2, 2) from the current position (2, 4). The solution should explore all possible adjacent empty spaces before deciding on the next move.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current position and goal position.
The current player position is at coordinates (2, 4), and the goal position is at coordinates (2, 2).

## Step 2: Identify the viable adjacent empty spaces to the current position.
Given the maze layout, and from the current position (2, 4), we need to look for adjacent empty spaces in all four directions (up, down, left, right).

## Step 3: Determine the coordinates of the adjacent empty spaces.
Looking at the empty spaces and considering the current position (2, 4), we can observe the following adjacent empty space options: moving left to (1, 4), moving up isn't viable directly as there's a wall at (2, 3 which actually allows for a down move from another cell but not directly relevant to this cell), and we're at the rightmost boundary of the provided information.

## Step 4: Choose the next step that gets us closer to the goal position.
Considering we need to get to (2, 2) from (2, 4), moving left and then finding a way up would be more logical since moving directly up (y-1) is obstructed by a wall at a position relevant to another cell but we can actually move left first. A better initial move, given our analysis, should actually explore the possibility of moving in the direction that gets us within the vicinity of the goal without prematurely moving into potential obstacles. The strategy here should prioritize avoiding getting trapped or moving further away from the goal while preferring moves that open up future options for reaching the goal.

## Step 5: Execute the chosen next step and update our position.
Considering our refined approach, the best next step from (2, 4) to get closer to the goal (2, 2), while avoiding obstacles and not moving further away unnecessarily, involves moving left (x-1) to utilize a potentially more open path that allows better approachability to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
After analyzing the original maze, we can see that the empty spaces form a corridor that resembles an "L" shape, connecting the player position to the goal position.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size as the original maze.
The original maze has a size of 5x5. We will create a new maze with the same size.

## Step 3: Design a new maze with empty spaces that form the same "L" shape as the original maze.
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will place the empty spaces in a way that forms an "L" corridor, but not identical to the original maze. We will also ensure that there is a valid path from the player position to the goal position.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original.
The new maze will have the same format as the original, with lists of coordinates denoting the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position.

## Step 5: Provide the new maze.
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 2)

The final answer is not applicable to this question as it does not require a numerical answer, but rather a descriptive answer and a new maze.
