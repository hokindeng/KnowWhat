You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search algorithm. I will explore all possible adjacent empty spaces from my current position and then choose the one that is closest to the goal.

From my current position (2, 4), I can move to the following adjacent empty spaces:

(1, 4) and no other empty spaces are available to move from the current position.

Since (1, 4) is the only available empty space adjacent to my current position and closest to the goal, I will choose it as my next move.

My next move is to (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (1, 4), I can move to the following adjacent empty spaces:

(2, 4) and (1, 2) and  (0, 4).

Since (2, 4) and (1, 2) and (0, 4) are available, but only (1, 2) gets me closer to the goal (2, 2), I will choose it as my next move.

However (0,4) and (2,4) donâ€™t reach goal fast. 

My next move is to (1, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "Z" shape or a "zigzag" shape.

Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form a similar "Z" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)

Note that this new maze has a similar "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The player can navigate from the starting position to the goal through the empty spaces.
