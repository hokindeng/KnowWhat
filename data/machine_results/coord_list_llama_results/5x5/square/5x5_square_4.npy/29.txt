You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only available move is to move up towards the goal. However, this is incorrect because it ignores the possibility of moving left and then up.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the given maze, focusing on the player position and goal position.
The player position is given as (2, 4) and the goal position is (2, 2). The task is to move the player from its current position to the goal position, moving through empty spaces and avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position.
From the player position (2, 4), we can move up, down, left, or right. Since we are trying to reach the goal at (2, 2), we need to examine the possible moves and determine which one brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 3: Examine the given empty spaces to determine valid moves.
The empty spaces in the maze are given as (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3). These are the only positions we can move to. Since we cannot move directly to the goal, we must move to an adjacent empty space that brings us closer.

## Step 4: Determine the best move that brings us closer to the goal.
Looking at the empty spaces available and considering our goal, we can see that the only available move that brings us closer to the goal is to move left from (2, 4) to (1, 4), and then we could move up. However, we can also move up from (2, 4) to (2, 3) and we will be closer. Moving left would increase the distance to the goal by 1 in the x-coordinate and kept the same in the y-coordinate.

## Step 5: Select and execute the chosen move.
From the analysis, the most direct path to the goal is to move up. Therefore, the next move should be from (2, 4) to (2, 3), moving closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the updated maze after the latest move.
The player position is now (2, 3) and the goal remains at (2, 2). We need to determine the next move based on the updated empty spaces and avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position.
From the updated player position (2, 3), we can move up, down, left, or right. Given that we are one step away from the goal in the y-direction and there is no wall between the current position and the goal, we should prioritize moving towards the goal.

## Step 3: Examine the given empty spaces to determine valid moves.
The updated empty spaces are (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4). However, since our goal is directly above our current position, we do not need to move to any of these spaces to reach the goal. We should move directly towards the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the best move that brings us closer to the goal.
The only move that makes sense in this context is to move up from (2, 3) to reach the goal directly.

## Step 5: Select and execute the chosen move.
Therefore, the next move should be from (2, 3) to (2, 2), which would place the player directly at the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
By examining the empty spaces in the original maze, (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), we can see that they form a general shape that resembles a right-angled "L" or a reversed "L" shape, but with a gap in the lower left part. However, focusing on the main pathway to the goal, it somewhat resembles a straight path with an extension to the right.


## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same general shape.
Given the original maze is 5x5, we will maintain this size for the new maze. To create a maze with the same general pathway shape but not identical, we can shift the entire path one position to the right, ensuring we maintain a valid path from P to G. This adjustment will create a distinct maze while retaining the straight path with an extension characteristic.

## Step 3: Define the new maze.
Walls will be placed to ensure that only the desired pathway is accessible, and the player can move from the new starting position to the new goal position without accessing areas outside the defined pathway.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze.
Given the constraints and the aim to replicate the pathway's general shape, the new maze is defined as follows:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (3, 2), (4, 4)

Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3)

However, I noticed this preliminary definition of walls and empty spaces doesn't perfectly encapsulate the desired pathway while also adhering strictly to the instructions for generating a new maze with the exact same shape of corridors but in a different configuration within the maze. A correction is needed to refine this attempt, ensuring the pathway from P to G is indeed a straight path with an extension, similar to the original maze but distinct.


## Step 5: Correction and Finalization.
Given the realization in Step 4, it's clear a revised approach is necessary. A more appropriate strategy is to recreate the maze while ensuring the path maintains a similar structure but in a different arrangement within the maze's confines. However, due to the strict instructions and the initial misinterpretation of the path's shape in the instructions provided for generating a new maze, a correction in understanding and approach is necessary.

Given this, a corrected version of the maze that maintains the original's characteristics while being distinct requires a different approach than initially outlined. The goal is to create a maze where the pathway resembles a straight line with an extension in a 5x5 grid, ensuring it's not identical to the original.

Let's correct the approach: The path should allow for a similar navigation experience as the original but shifted or altered in a way that maintains the maze's size and the path's general shape. This means walls and empty spaces need to be redefined to create this experience.

However, the exact pathway's nature in the original maze and the stipulation to keep the new maze the same size with a similar path shape necessitate a precise strategy for wall and empty space placement that was not fully achieved in the steps above.

Given the constraints and the need for a precise answer, let's focus on defining a new maze that adheres to the original instructions more closely than the iterative process initially described.

The final answer is:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)

Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)


However, it seems this final attempt still doesn't perfectly align with the requirement for the general shape formed by the corridors to be exactly the same as the original due to an oversight in the precise replication of the pathway's shape amidst the constraints of the new maze's layout. The exact replication of the pathway in a new configuration within the same size maze, as per the instructions, necessitates a careful examination that might not have been fully achieved in the response provided. Therefore, a more detailed analysis or correction might be warranted to ensure the new maze meets all specified criteria accurately.
