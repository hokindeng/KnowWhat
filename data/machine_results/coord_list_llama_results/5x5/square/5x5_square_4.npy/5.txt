You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only viable next position is down (right is blocked by the edge of the maze, and both up and left are blocked by walls). However, it overlooks the fact that the position directly to the left of (2, 4) is (2, 3), which is listed as an empty space in the maze, not a wall.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Assess the initial maze layout
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a player position (P) at (2, 4), and a goal position (G) at (2, 2). We need to navigate from P to G through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Determine possible initial moves
From the starting position (2, 4), we can potentially move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. We need to check which of these directions lead to an empty space.

## Step 3: Examine the immediate surroundings of the current position
Looking at the coordinates provided for empty spaces, we notice that moving directly left from (2, 4) would place us at (2, 3), which is listed as an empty space.

## Step 4: Select a viable next move
Given that the position directly to the left is an empty space, a viable next move is to move left from (2, 4) to (2, 3).

## Step 5: Execute the move and update the position
We decide to move left. This means our new position will be (2, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current maze layout after the latest move
The maze layout has been updated to reflect the new player position (P) at (2, 3), and the goal remains at (2, 2).

## Step 2: Determine possible moves from the updated position
From the current position (2, 3), we need to check which directions (up, down, left, right) lead to an empty space.

## Step 3: Examine the immediate surroundings of the updated position
We analyze the positions around (2, 3) and compare them to the empty spaces and walls. Moving left from (2, 3) would place us at (2, 2), which is the goal position, and it is adjacent to our current position, but we must confirm if it is directly accessible.

## Step 4: Select a viable next move
Given that the goal position (2, 2) is the space we aim to reach and it is adjacent to our current position, and noting that moving left is the direction that would take us directly to the goal, we must assess the empty and wall lists again. Since moving left means decreasing the y-coordinate from (2, 3) to (2, 2) and that space is not listed as a wall but is the goal, a viable next move would logically be to attempt to move left to (2, 2), directly to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
By examining the coordinates of the empty spaces in the original maze, we can visualize that they form a shape that resembles a pathway. Given the arrangement of these spaces, it can be described as forming an "L" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape of empty spaces
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to place walls, empty spaces, a player position (P), and a goal position (G) in such a way that the empty spaces form an "L" shape. This new maze must be of the same size as the original (5x5 grid) and not be an identical copy.

## Step 3: Place the walls and empty spaces to form the "L" shape
To form an "L" shape with empty spaces in a 5x5 grid, we can place one arm of the "L" along the top row and the other arm down a column. For instance, we can use the first row and the last column for the "L" shape. This leaves us with flexible choices for the player and goal positions.

## Step 4: Determine the coordinates for the new maze
Considering the "L" shape formed by the empty spaces in the new maze:
- Empty spaces could be placed at (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), and (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4) to form the "L" shape.
- Walls can be placed at all other positions not occupied by empty spaces or the player and goal positions.
- The player position (P) can be placed at one end of the "L" shape, for example, at (0, 1), and the goal position (G) at the other end, for instance, at (4, 4).

## Step 5: Encode the new maze
Using the same format as the original, the new maze can be encoded as follows:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (4, 4)

The final answer is: 
 No answer needed for this question, it is asking for a new maze not a numerical value.
