You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only available move is to move up and then left. However, upon re-examining the maze, we can see that there is an empty space at (1, 4) that is adjacent to the player's current position. Therefore, a more optimal move would be to move to (1, 4) first.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the current position of the player and the goal.
The player is currently at (2, 4), and the goal is at (2, 2).

## Step 2: Determine the available moves from the current position.
Given the player can move up, down, left, or right to an empty space, and considering the position of the walls and empty spaces, the player's available moves are to move up to (1, 4) or to move left to (2, 3).

## Step 3: Evaluate which move brings the player closer to the goal or avoids being trapped.
Since the goal is to reach (2, 2), moving left to (2, 3) brings the player closer to the goal directly but considering the overall maze structure, moving up to (1, 4) then provides more options for the next move.

## Step 4: Choose the most beneficial move based on the analysis.
Given the analysis, the best next move is to (1, 4), since it allows the player to move closer to the goal in subsequent moves and avoids potential traps.

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the chosen move.
The coordinates of the chosen move are (1, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original solution approach remains correct. The player should continue moving towards the goal (2, 2) while avoiding walls.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the current position of the player and the goal.
The player is currently at (1, 4), and the goal is at (2, 2).

## Step 2: Determine the available moves from the current position.
Given the player can move up, down, left, or right to an empty space, and considering the position of the walls and empty spaces, the player's available moves are to move left to (1, 3) but that's blocked by a wall, or move down to (2, 4) which is an empty space.

## Step 3: Evaluate which move brings the player closer to the goal or avoids being trapped.
Since the goal is to reach (2, 2), moving down to (2, 4) brings the player closer to the goal in terms of horizontal position but further in terms of vertical position, however given the maze layout, it is the best next step to make progress towards the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the most beneficial move based on the analysis.
Given the analysis, the best next move is to (2, 4), since it allows the player to move closer to the goal in subsequent moves and avoids potential traps.

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the chosen move.
The coordinates of the chosen move are (2, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the current position of the player and the goal.
The player is currently at (2, 4), and the goal is at (2, 2).

## Step 2: Determine the available moves from the current position.
Given the player can move up, down, left, or right to an empty space, and considering the position of the walls and empty spaces, the player's available move is to move left to (2, 3).

## Step 3: Evaluate which move brings the player closer to the goal or avoids being trapped.
Since the goal is to reach (2, 2), moving left to (2, 3) brings the player closer to the goal and is the only viable move given the maze layout.

## Step 4: Choose the most beneficial move based on the analysis.
Given the analysis, the best next move is to (2, 3), since it directly moves the player closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the chosen move.
The coordinates of the chosen move are (2, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the current position of the player and the goal.
The player is currently at (2, 3), and the goal is at (2, 2).

## Step 2: Determine the available moves from the current position.
Given the player can move up, down, left, or right to an empty space, and considering the position of the walls and empty spaces, the player's available move is to move left to (2, 2), which is the goal.

## Step 3: Confirm that moving to the goal position is possible.
Since (2, 2) is the goal and it is directly adjacent to the player's current position, moving left to (2, 2) is the correct next move.

## Step 4: Choose the move that achieves the goal.
Given the analysis, the best next move is to (2, 2), as it directly achieves the goal.

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the chosen move.
The coordinates of the chosen move are (2, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Upon reviewing the original maze, the empty spaces form a shape that can be generally described as an "L-shape" or an "elbow shape", connecting the player's position to the goal. However, considering the overall layout, it's more accurate to describe the empty spaces as forming a "zigzag" or a "staircase" pattern, but most precisely it can be recognized as an "L-shape".

## Step 2: Generate a new maze of the same size with the same general shape formed by the empty spaces.
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we will maintain the same size (5x5) and ensure that the empty spaces form an "L-shape" that provides a valid path from the player's position (P) to the goal (G). Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 4)

The final answer is: This new maze maintains the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces that form an "L-shape", without being an identical copy of the original maze.
