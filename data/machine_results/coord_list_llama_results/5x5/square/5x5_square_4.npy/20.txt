You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The incorrect assumption in Step 4 is that since the possible moves' evaluation did not prioritize the distance to the goal, the next move was chosen without consideration for the most direct path to the goal. A more efficient approach would be to evaluate not just the immediate adjacency but also to prioritize moves that reduce the distance to the goal.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current player position and the goal position.
The player position is (2, 4), and the goal is (2, 2).

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current position.
The possible moves are up, down, left, and right, provided the target space is empty.

## Step 3: Evaluate the empty spaces adjacent to the player's current position.
Given the current position (2, 4), the adjacent empty space is (2, 3).

## Step 4: Prioritize moves towards the goal.
To reach the goal (2, 2) efficiently, prioritize moves that reduce the distance to the goal. Given that the current position is (2, 4) and the goal is directly upwards, moving up to (2, 3) is the most direct move towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position and the goal position.
The player position is now (2, 3), and the goal remains (2, 2).

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current position.
The possible moves are up, down, left, and right, provided the target space is empty.

## Step 3: Evaluate the empty spaces adjacent to the player's current position.
Given the current position (2, 3), and knowing the maze's layout, moving up would put us at the goal (2, 2).

## Step 4: Prioritize moves towards the goal.
Since moving up from (2, 3) to (2, 2) directly reaches the goal, this is the most efficient and direct move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a ladder or a step-like structure leading from the top right to the bottom left, but with a clear vertical path in the left and a step-like structure in the middle and right. However, focusing on the area around the player's path, it resembles more of a simple vertical line or a straight path with an offshoot, rather than a complex shape.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces.
Given the straightforward path from the player's position to the goal, especially after reevaluation, the shape can be considered a simple "Straight Line" with an offshoot or a minor deviation.

## Step 3: Create a new maze of the same size with the same general shape formed by the empty spaces.
The new maze should have the same dimensions as the original (5x5) and include a path from the player's position to the goal that represents a straight line. The walls and empty spaces should be rearranged to create a new, non-identical maze.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze.
Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

The final answer is: There is no numerical answer to this problem as it asks for descriptive and creative responses rather than a numerical solution.
