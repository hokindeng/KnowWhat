You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only viable next position is down (right is blocked by the edge of the maze, and both up and left are blocked by walls). However, it overlooks the fact that the position directly to the left of (2, 4) is (2, 3), which is listed as an empty space in the maze, not a wall.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Assess the initial maze layout
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a player position (P) at (2, 4), and a goal position (G) at (2, 2). We need to navigate from P to G through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Determine possible initial moves
From the starting position (2, 4), we can potentially move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. We need to check which of these directions lead to an empty space.

## Step 3: Examine the immediate surroundings of the current position
Looking at the coordinates provided for empty spaces, we notice that moving directly left from (2, 4) would place us at (2, 3), which is listed as an empty space.

## Step 4: Select a viable next move
Given that the position directly to the left is an empty space, a viable next move is to move left from (2, 4) to (2, 3).

## Step 5: Execute the move and update the position
We decide to move left. This means our new position will be (2, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current maze layout after the latest move
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a player position (P) now at (2, 3), and a goal position (G) still at (2, 2). We need to continue navigating from P to G through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Determine possible next moves
From the current position (2, 3), we can potentially move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. We need to check which of these directions lead to an empty space or the goal.

## Step 3: Examine the immediate surroundings of the current position
Looking at the coordinates provided, moving directly left from (2, 3) would place us at (2, 2), which is the goal position.

## Step 4: Select a viable next move
Given that the position directly to the left is the goal, a viable and optimal next move is to move left from (2, 3) to (2, 2).

## Step 5: Execute the move and update the position
We decide to move left. This means our new position will be (2, 2), which is the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
Based on the coordinates of the empty spaces in the original maze, it appears that they form a shape that resembles a reversed "L" or a "corner" shape, given the positioning of the corridors.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze of the same size with the same shape of empty spaces
To create a new maze with the same shape of empty spaces, we will aim to replicate the "corner" or "L" shape with different positions for the empty spaces and walls while ensuring the maze remains solvable from a new player position to a new goal position.

## Step 3: Determine the new positions of walls and empty spaces
Given the 5x5 size of the maze, we will rearrange the walls and empty spaces. For simplicity, let's mirror the original maze's empty and wall spaces across the vertical axis of the maze. This will retain the "corner" or "L" shape while providing a distinct maze.

## Step 4: Define the new player and goal positions
In the new maze, we need to ensure there's a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G) through the empty spaces. Given our mirrored design, we will place the player position at a point that mirrors the original position relative to the new empty spaces and similarly for the goal.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze using the specified format
Let's encode the new maze, keeping in mind the mirrored design across the vertical axis:

- Walls will now occupy the right side, mirroring their original left-side positions.
- Empty spaces will form an "L" shape on the right side, opening a path from the new player position to the new goal position.

The final answer is:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (2, 2)

The shape is: $\boxed{L}$
