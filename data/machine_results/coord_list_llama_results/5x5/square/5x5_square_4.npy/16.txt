You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will analyze the given positions and attempt to find a path from the current player position (2, 4) to the goal position (2, 2).

Given the available empty spaces and considering I can only move up, down, left, or right, from the current position (2, 4), my only viable move that keeps me on the path and avoids walls is to move left to position (2, 3).

Next move coordinates: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Considering the updated maze and my current position (2, 3), I need to find a viable move towards the goal (2, 2). Since I can move up, down, left, or right, and my goal is to the left of my current position but is blocked by walls below and above my desired path, I will move up is not possible as there is a wall above, move down is not possible as well, move right would take me further away from my goal and I already came from that direction. 

Thus I will attempt to move to the position that gets me closer to the goal, my viable move is to position (2, 2) left to my current position, however since you cannot reach that position directly, move to position that has a chance of getting there from the empty list is (1, 2) from there it is possible to move left or right on the next turn.

Next move coordinates: No direct path, answer is (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I've reached position (1, 2). My goal is still (2, 2). Since I'm on the same column as the goal but one row above isn't possible due to a wall, I can now attempt to move down to the goal position's row, to position right of goal (2,3),  then from there move left, avoiding the wall.

Next move coordinates: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2, 3), which is right next to the goal, I will move to the goal position directly.

Next move coordinates: (2, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "(Disconnected) Z-Shape" or " Bent or Broken Z-shape with horizontal lines", however its main body is bent horizontally.

Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a similar Z-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

This maze has a similar Z-shape, however its tail is pointing to the left horizontally.
