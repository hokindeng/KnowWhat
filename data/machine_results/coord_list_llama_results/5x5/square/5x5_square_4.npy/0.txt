You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only viable next position is down (right is blocked by the edge of the maze, and both up and left are blocked by walls). However, it overlooks the fact that the position directly to the left of (2, 4) is (2, 3), which is listed as an empty space in the maze, not a wall.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Assess the initial maze layout
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a player position (P) at (2, 4), and a goal position (G) at (2, 2). We need to navigate from P to G through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Determine possible initial moves
From the starting position (2, 4), we can potentially move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. We need to check which of these directions lead to an empty space.

## Step 3: Examine the immediate surroundings of the current position
Looking at the coordinates provided for empty spaces, we notice that moving directly left from (2, 4) would place us at (2, 3), which is listed as an empty space.

## Step 4: Select a viable next move
Given that the position directly to the left is an empty space, a viable next move is to move left from (2, 4) to (2, 3).

## Step 5: Execute the move and update the position
We decide to move left. This means our new position will be (2, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
This solution does not involve correcting a previous mistake but involves the next move in solving the maze.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Assess the current maze layout
The maze still has walls, empty spaces, a player position (P) now at (2, 3), and a goal position (G) at (2, 2). We continue to navigate from P to G through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Determine possible next moves
From the current position (2, 3), we can potentially move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. We need to check which of these directions lead to an empty space or the goal.

## Step 3: Examine the immediate surroundings of the current position
We're at (2, 3), and moving up would place us at (2, 2), which is the goal position (G). Moving in other directions either places us into a wall or out of the maze bounds.

## Step 4: Select a viable next move
Given the goal position is directly up from our current position, the next viable move is to move up from (2, 3) to (2, 2).

## Step 5: Execute the move and update the position
We decide to move up. This means our new position will be (2, 2), which is the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
This solution does not involve correcting a previous mistake but involves providing additional analysis and creating a new maze as per the instructions.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
Looking at the paths formed by the empty spaces, the general shape resembles a rectangle with extensions on the sides, but it can be most simply described as having a rectangular shape with some additional pathways.


## Step 2: Determine the size of the maze
The original maze has walls and empty spaces within a 5x5 grid.


## Step 3: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same general shape
Given the constraint that the maze should be a 5x5 grid and should include empty spaces that form a similar rectangular shape with pathways from P to G, we will create a new maze.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Walls and empty spaces need to be defined. To match the rectangular shape with pathways, walls will be placed to create a similar shape but not an identical one.

## Step 5: Position P and G
Ensure P (Player) and G (Goal) positions are set within the empty spaces such that there is a pathway between them.

## Step 6: Present the new maze
Given the constraints and the rectangular pathway shape, here is a new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (2, 4)

This new maze is of the same size as the original, includes pathways that form a similar rectangular shape, is not an identical copy, and has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces.

The final answer is: 
Since there is no numerical answer, we'll describe it:
Name of shape: Rectangular with pathways.
New Maze Description is given above.
