You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only viable move from the player's starting position (2, 4) is to move down to (3, 4). However, according to the problem statement, the player can move to any empty space adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. The correct approach is to explore all possible directions (up, down, left, right) and choose a valid empty space that brings the player closer to the goal or doesn't increase the distance to the goal.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current player position and the goal position.
The current player position is given as (2, 4) and the goal position is (2, 2).

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current player position.
Given the maze layout and the rules for movement (up, down, left, right), the possible moves from (2, 4) are (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4), or (2, 5). However, (3, 4) is blocked by a wall and (2, 5) is outside the maze since the maze only goes from (0, 0) to (4, 4). So, the actual possible moves are (1, 4) and (2, 3).

## Step 3: Examine each possible move to determine if it is a wall or an empty space.
(1, 4) is listed as an empty space and (2, 3) is also listed as an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the move that brings us closer to the goal or doesn't increase the distance to the goal.
The goal position is (2, 2). Moving from (2, 4) to (2, 3), we decrease the distance in the y-direction by one, moving closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Select the coordinates of the next move based on the evaluation in step 4.
The next move will be to (2, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original solution process for determining the next move remains correct but needs to be adjusted for the new position and available moves.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current player position and the goal position.
The current player position is given as (2, 3) and the goal position is (2, 2).

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current player position.
Given the maze layout and the rules for movement (up, down, left, right), the possible moves from (2, 3) are (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), or (2, 4). However, (3, 3) is blocked by a wall.

## Step 3: Examine each possible move to determine if it is a wall or an empty space.
(1, 3) is listed as a wall, (2, 2) is not explicitly listed as an empty space but is the goal and (2, 4) is listed as an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the move that brings us closer to the goal or doesn't increase the distance to the goal.
The goal position is (2, 2) and directly adjacent to our current position (2, 3), moving directly to the goal (2, 2) is the most efficient option.

## Step 5: Select the coordinates of the next move based on the evaluation in step 4.
The next move will be to (2, 2), which is the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original task requires providing the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces and creating a new maze that meets specific criteria.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Upon inspecting the original maze's empty spaces, it appears they form a path that can be described as having a "L" or "corner" shape, connecting the player position to the goal with the rest of the empty spaces forming an extension or tail along the edges of the maze.


## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and the same general shape for the empty spaces.
To create a new maze that is not an identical copy but retains the same shape for the empty spaces, we adjust the positions of walls and empty spaces while ensuring a valid path from the player to the goal exists.

## Step 3: Define the new maze's layout.
Adjusting the positions while keeping the same shape in mind:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

This new maze retains the "L" or "corner" shape for the empty spaces and provides a valid path from the player's position to the goal without being an identical copy of the original maze.


The final answer is: The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "L" or "corner" shape, and the new maze that meets the specified criteria is:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)
