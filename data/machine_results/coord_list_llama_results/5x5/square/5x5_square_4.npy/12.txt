You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

Since I am at position (2, 4) and my goal is (2, 2), I will move towards the goal. The only possible move from my current position is to the left, as moving up, down, or right would result in hitting a wall or going out of bounds.

Therefore, my next move is to position (2, 3), which is an empty space.

Next move: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With my current position at (2, 3), I still need to move towards the goal (2, 2). Since I've already moved left previously, I will continue to move left.

However, I need to make sure that my next move is a valid empty space. Fortunately, (2, 2) is the goal position, which means it must be an empty space (otherwise, it would be impossible to reach the goal).

Therefore, my next move is directly to the goal position.

Next move: (2, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A vertical line or column with a detour or a "bump" in the middle.

To create a new maze with the same size and shape, here is a new encoding:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a vertical line with a detour in the middle. However, the maze is not an identical copy of the original, with some of the walls shifted around to create a new path.
