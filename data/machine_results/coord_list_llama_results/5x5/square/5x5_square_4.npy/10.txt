You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

From the current player position (2, 4), I can move up, down, left, or right. Since the goal is (2, 2), I will prioritize moving up to reduce the y-coordinate.

Checking adjacent positions:

- Up: (2, 3) is an empty space.
- Down: (2, 5) is out of bounds.
- Left: (1, 4) is an empty space, but it's not directly closer to the goal.
- Right: (3, 4) is a wall.

My next move is to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the possible moves from the current player position (2, 3).

Checking adjacent positions:

- Up: (2, 2) is the goal position!
- Down: (2, 4) is an empty space, but it's not closer to the goal.
- Left: (1, 3) is a wall.
- Right: (3, 3) is a wall.

My next move is to (2, 2), which is the goal position! I've solved the maze!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A disconnected zigzag or a broken ladder.

To generate a new maze with the same characteristics, I'll create a new set of walls and empty spaces that form a similar shape. Here's a new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is also a disconnected zigzag or broken ladder, similar to the original maze.
