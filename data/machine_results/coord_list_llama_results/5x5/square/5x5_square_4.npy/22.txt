You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only viable next position is down (right is blocked by the edge of the maze, and both up and left are blocked by walls). However, it overlooks the fact that the position directly to the left of (2, 4) is (2, 3), which is listed as an empty space in the maze, not a wall.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Assess the initial maze layout
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a player position (P) at (2, 4), and a goal position (G) at (2, 2). We need to navigate from P to G through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Determine possible initial moves
From the starting position (2, 4), we can potentially move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. We need to check which of these directions lead to an empty space.

## Step 3: Examine the immediate surroundings of the current position
Looking at the coordinates provided for empty spaces, we notice that moving directly left from (2, 4) would place us at (2, 3), which is listed as an empty space.

## Step 4: Select a viable next move
Given that the position directly to the left is an empty space, a viable next move is to move left from (2, 4) to (2, 3).

## Step 5: Execute the move and update the position
We decide to move left. This means our new position will be (2, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The previous solution correctly determined the next move. Now, based on the updated maze, we need to determine the next move from the new position (2, 3).


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Assess the updated maze layout
The updated maze has the same walls, empty spaces, but the player position (P) is now at (2, 3), and the goal position (G) remains at (2, 2).

## Step 2: Determine possible moves
From the current position (2, 3), we can potentially move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. We need to check which of these directions lead to an empty space.

## Step 3: Examine the immediate surroundings of the current position
Looking at the coordinates provided for empty spaces and considering the updated player position, moving directly left from (2, 3) would place us at (2, 2), which is the goal position (G).

## Step 4: Select a viable next move
Given that the goal is directly to the left and is an adjacent empty space, a viable next move is to move left from (2, 3) to (2, 2).

## Step 5: Execute the move and update the position
We decide to move left. This means our new position will be (2, 2), which is the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Based on the original maze, the empty spaces (corridors) form a shape that can be navigated from the initial player position (P) to the goal position (G).


# Solution

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze's empty spaces form a general "L" shape that connects the initial player position to the goal position, allowing navigation through the empty spaces.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same shape
To create a new maze of the same size (5x5) with the same "L" shape formed by the empty spaces, we need to define new wall and empty space coordinates. We also need to ensure the maze is not an identical copy of the original and provides a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Determine the new coordinates for walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal
Given the need for the same "L" shape but in a different configuration, we can rotate the "L" shape to start from the top-right corner of the maze and extend downwards and then to the left.

## Step 4: Define the new maze
New Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
New Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (4, 1)
New Player position: (1, 0)
New Goal: (0, 0)

The final answer is:

 Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
 Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (4, 1)
 Player position: (1, 0)
 Goal: (0, 0)
