You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the next step can only be left because of the constraints provided in the question. However, this approach doesn't consider the overall solution to the maze, as it only looks one step ahead. The original solution does not expand its search to find a correct solution.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
First, let's visualize the maze layout based on the provided information. We have the coordinates of the walls, empty spaces, the player position, and the goal position. This will help us to understand the possible paths we can take.

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves
From the player position (2, 4), we can move in any of the four directions: up, down, left, or right. However, we can only move to empty spaces, so we need to check the coordinates of the adjacent empty spaces.

## Step 3: Evaluate the possible moves
The possible moves from (2, 4) are to move up to (1, 4) or move left to (2, 3).

## Step 4: Choose the optimal move
Since we are not constrained by the requirement to only move left, we can explore both upward and leftward movements. To reach the goal position (2, 2), we can consider which move brings us closer to the goal or provides more future possibilities.

## Step 5: Explore upward movement
If we move up to (1, 4), we need to consider the next possible steps from that position. We could move left to (1, 3), but it is a wall, or left to (1, 2), which is a valid empty space.

## Step 6: Explore leftward movement
If we move left to (2, 3), we are directly above the goal, and the next move would certainly bring us to the goal.

## Step 7: Determine the first move of the optimal path
Considering the layout and our objective, the first move should bring us closer to the goal while ensuring future moves are possible. Since moving left to (2, 3) brings us closer to the goal and sets up an immediate path to the goal, this seems like the best choice.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

## Step 3: Evaluate the possible moves
Considering the maze layout and the goal position, we evaluate the possible moves from (2, 3).

## Step 4: Choose the optimal move
We see that moving right to (2, 4) is valid but does not bring us closer to the goal. We also see that moving up or down is not possible because those spaces are outside the empty spaces provided. Therefore, moving left seems like the optimal move as the goal position is (2, 2), which is right next to our current position.

## Step 5: Final evaluation
If we move left from (2, 3), we reach (2, 2), which is the goal position.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original solution provided by the AI was incomplete because it doesn't exist.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the general shape formed by the empty spaces
First, we need to analyze the original maze and identify the general shape formed by its empty spaces. By visualizing the maze, we can see that the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a backwards "L".


## Step 2: Name the general shape
Based on our analysis, we can name the general shape formed by the empty spaces as an "L-shape" or more specifically, a "backwards L-shape".


## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
Now, we need to create a new maze that meets the required criteria. The new maze should have the same size as the original (5x5), include a valid path from P to G, and have empty spaces that form a backwards L-shape.


## Step 4: Define the new maze
After creating the new maze, we can define it using the same format as the original.

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)


## Step 5: Final evaluation
The new maze meets the required criteria: same size, valid path from P to G, and a backwards L-shape formed by the empty spaces.


The final answer is: 
  The general shape formed by the corridors is an L-shape, more specifically a backwards L-shape.
$boxed{Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)}$
