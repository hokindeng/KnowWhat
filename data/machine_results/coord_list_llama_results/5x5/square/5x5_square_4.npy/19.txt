You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only viable move from the player's starting position (2, 4) is to move down to (3, 4). However, according to the problem statement, the player can move to any empty space adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. The correct solution should consider all possible moves and choose the one that brings the player closer to the goal.

# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the Current Position
The player's current position is (2, 4), and the goal is to reach (2, 2).

## Step 2: Examine Possible Moves
Given the current position, we can examine the possible moves by checking the adjacent cells:
- Up: (2, 3) is an empty space.
- Down: (3, 4) is a wall.
- Left: (1, 4) is an empty space.
- Right: There is no space to the right of (2, 4).

## Step 3: Determine the Best Move
Based on the analysis, the best move to get closer to the goal is to move up to (2, 3).

## Step 4: Finalize the Next Move
Given the analysis, the coordinates of our next move will be to the position that brings us closer to the goal, which is (2, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  3\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original solution correctly moves the player to (2, 3).

# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the Current Position
The player's current position is (2, 3), and the goal is to reach (2, 2).

## Step 2: Examine Possible Moves
Given the current position, we can examine the possible moves by checking the adjacent cells:
- Up: (2, 2) is the goal.
- Down: (2, 4) is an empty space.
- Left: (1, 3) is a wall.
- Right: There is no space to the right of (2, 3).

## Step 3: Determine the Best Move
Based on the analysis, the best move to get closer to the goal is to move up to (2, 2), which is the goal itself.

## Step 4: Finalize the Next Move
Given the analysis, the coordinates of our next move will be to the goal position, which is (2, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original solution correctly moves the player to the goal position (2, 2).


# Correct Solution


## Step 1: Determine the General Shape of the Empty Spaces
Based on the original maze, the general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "zigzag" or a modified "S-shape" that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal.


## Step 2: Generate a New Maze with the Same Shape
To create a new maze of the same size and shape, we need to define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position.


## Step 3: Define the New Maze
The new maze will have the following configuration:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)


## Step 4: Verify the New Maze
The new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from the player to the goal, is not an identical copy of the original, and forms a recognizable zigzag or S-shape with its empty spaces.


The final answer is:


(1) The name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "zigzag" or a modified "S-shape".


(2) The new maze:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)
