You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze. Since the player position is at (2, 4) and the goal is at (2, 2), and we can only move through empty spaces, I will look for adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent empty space to (2, 4) is (1, 4), which is in the up direction. However, moving up to (1, 4) will not bring us closer to the goal. We should consider the left direction, as the goal is to our left.

A possible move to the left would be to position (2, 3), which is an empty space. 

The coordinates of my next move would be (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze. Since the player position is at (2, 3) and the goal is at (2, 2), I will look for adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent space to the left of (2, 3) is the goal, but unfortunately, it is blocked by no adjacent empty space to the left and a wall below. However, I see an empty space above the goal at (1, 2). But it isn't adjacent to my current position, so I have to move somewhere else first. The space above my current position, (1, 3), is a wall. The space to the right, (2, 4), is an empty space, but moving there would increase the distance to the goal.

However, a space above (2, 4) is (1, 4), and a space to the left of (1, 4) is empty. We can exploit this path. A possible move to the right would be to position (2, 4), and then we could make subsequent moves from there. 

The coordinates of my next move would be (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 4), I will look for adjacent empty spaces to the current position. Moving down would bring me back to the previous position, and moving right is not possible. However, moving up is a viable option.

A possible move up would be to position (1, 4), which is an empty space. 

The coordinates of my next move would be (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1, 4), I will look for adjacent empty spaces to the current position. 

A possible move left would be to position (1, no available space left to the current position is an option other than) no...  there is no space, but two spaces to the left would put us at (1, 2) an empty space. But first we have to get there, to the left of (1, 4) which puts me in a position of (1, 3), so that will be my move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "( Bent / Hook / L-shape".


Here is a new maze with the same size and a path that forms a Bent / Hook / L-shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)
