You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move. Based on the current player position (3, 2) and the goal position (3, 0), I see that I can move left towards the goal. My next move will be to the empty space at coordinates (3, 1).

However, since there's a wall at (3, 1), I'll move up to the empty space at coordinates (2, 2) instead.

No, wait! A more efficient move would be to go left and up is not an option, I will go up to (2, 2)  no...  I can move to (4, 2) or to (2,2),  Going to (4,2) doesn't seem efficient but going to 2,2 would put me in the right direction.

So my move is (2, 2) no...  That is one option and another one is (4,2) , the most efficient one is moving to (2,2), still thinking if is (4,2), no because this would let me away from goal so this could leave me farther, going up leaves me on the correct side that contains a free space adjacent to my goal at a distance of  (4 or 3 spaces). going up has more chances that bring me sooner to goal so:
New position: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the current state of the maze, I will analyze the possible moves from my current position (2, 2). I can move up to (2, 1) or left to (2, 1 is better because is toward goal or more exactly is getting closer in the hallway to goal or putting it on words, going left on the options lead sooner to the goal or like if I get left this increases my odds to get closer to the  final destination...

 Player go to  (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the possible moves from my current position (2, 1). I can move down to (3, 1), but that's a wall. I can move up to (1, 1), but that's also a wall. I can move right to (2, 2), but that would be moving away from the goal. The only viable option is to move left to (2, 0).

New position: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 0), I'll analyze the possible moves. I can move down to (3, 0), which is the goal position.

New position: (3, 0) 

It seems I have reached the goal!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "U" shape or a "bent corridor" shape.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from the player position to the goal position that can be reached through the empty spaces. The general shape formed by the empty spaces is still a recognizable "U" shape or "bent corridor" shape. The maze is not an identical copy of the original maze.
