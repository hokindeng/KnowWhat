You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since I'm at position (3, 2), I will examine the adjacent coordinates.

To the north (up) is (2, 2), which is an empty space.
To the south (down) is (4, 2), which is an empty space.
To the east (right) is (3, 3), which is a wall.
To the west (left) is (3, 1), which is a wall.

Considering these options, my next move will be to the north (up) to the empty space at coordinates (2, 2), and then I can try to find a path to the goal from there. However, since my ultimate goal is to reach (3, 0), which is on the same column as my current position, I will move west is not possible, but I can move to the space that will allow me to go west afterwards.  So I will move to (2,2) and then try to find my way to the column where the goal is located and from there, I can move to the goal, which is on the same column, just up.

But taking a better look at the maze, there is a faster way, I see a shortcut. I will move to the space (4, 2). This is the beginning of the path to the goal.

My next move is to the coordinates (4, 2).
Please let me know the outcome of this move and present the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (4, 2). Let me analyze the adjacent coordinates:

To the north (up) is (3, 2), which is an empty space.
To the south (down) is outside the maze, so it's not an option.
To the east (right) is (4, 3), which is a wall.
To the west (left) is (4, 1), which is an empty space.

Considering these options, I need to move towards the goal, which is on the west side and one row up. My next move will be to the west (left) to the empty space at coordinates (4, 1).

My next move is to the coordinates (4, 1).
Please let me know the outcome of this move and present the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (4, 1). Let me analyze the adjacent coordinates:

To the north (up) is (3, 1), which is a wall.
To the south (down) is outside the maze, so it's not an option.
To the east (right) is (4, 2), which is an empty space.
To the west (left) is (4, 0), which is an empty space.

Considering these options, I want to move closer to the goal. Since I'm in the same column as a wall in the row above, I need to move west and then try to go up. My next move will be to the west (left) to the empty space at coordinates (4, 0).

My next move is to the coordinates (4, 0).
Please let me know the outcome of this move and present the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (4, 0). Let me analyze the adjacent coordinates:

To the north is outside the maze, but wait, actually I can move up (but one space to the north and one to the east) to the empty space at (3,1) no: there is a wall in that spot. 
To the south (down) is outside the maze, so it's not an option.
To the east (right) is (4, 1), which is an empty space.
To the west (left) is outside the maze.

However since my goal is to reach (3,0) and that space is currently blocked by no walls, (and one space up) from my actual position I can move up there and I am in the goal. Goal. That is (3,0) 

My next move is to the coordinates (3,0).
Please let me know the outcome of this move and present the updated maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "L-Shape" or "Gamma Shape" (∇)

This shape is formed by the empty spaces in the original maze, which consist of a vertical section (4,0 to 4,2) and a horizontal section (4,2 to 2,2) connected at a right angle, resembling an L-shape or an inverted Greek letter gamma (∇).

Here is a new maze with the same size and a similar L-Shape or Gamma Shape (∇) formed by the empty spaces:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Note that this new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and its empty spaces form a recognizable L-Shape or Gamma Shape (∇).
