You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The incorrect assumption in Step 4 is that since the destination (G) is not an immediate move from the current position and involves backtracking, we might need to plan steps ahead or recognize a pattern that isn't immediately available. However, there is a straightforward path from P to G without needing to backtrack.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Determine the available moves from the current player position.
The player is at (3, 2). We need to look at the neighboring spaces to determine where we can move. The neighbors are (3, 1), (3, 3), (2, 2), and (4, 2). Given the spaces provided, (3, 1) is a wall, (3, 3) is a wall, (2, 2) is an empty space, and (4, 2) is an empty space.

## Step 2: Choose the next move based on the shortest path to the goal.
Considering our goal is at (3, 0) and the available empty spaces are (2, 2) and (4, 2), the best move towards reaching the goal is to move to (2, 2), as there's a possibility to go around the walls from there.

## Step 3: Confirm the new player position after the move.
After moving to (2, 2), we need to confirm if this new space aligns with our goal of reaching (3, 0). It does, as it moves us closer to the goal position, albeit diagonally, and sets us up for potential further moves towards the goal.

## Step 4: Plan the next steps towards the goal.
Since the destination (G) is now closer, we can observe that moving from (2, 2) to (2, 1) to (2, 0) would bring us directly above the goal, at which point we recognize the maze structure doesn't directly allow a path from our current position to (3, 0) without going through walls. However, seeing that (2, 0), (2, 1), and (2, 2) are directly connected, we can then try to navigate around the maze from this new vantage point to see if there's an indirect path.

## Step 5: Execute the navigation plan.
Since we noticed there's no direct path, we correctly figure that moving to (2, 0), then to (2, 1), gets us closer but doesn't complete the task. We missed noticing the player could reach (2, 0) or (4, 0) or (4, 1) and then possibly align with the goal's x-coordinate by moving down or up accordingly.

## Step 6: Final move calculation
The correct approach is to aim for (2, 0) and realize we can reach (3, 0) by navigating from (2, 1) to (2, 0) is impossible, but (4, 0) is reachable from the current position in a few steps: (3, 2) to (4, 2), to (4, 1), and then to (4, 0) before aiming to be in line with (3, 0). However, the direct path is for (3, 2) to move to (4, 2), to (4, 1) then to (4, 0) and proceed accordingly.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Looking at the coordinates provided for the empty spaces (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), and (4, 2), we can observe that they form two vertical corridors or paths that are parallel to each other.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces.
Based on the observation, the general shape can be described as "parallel vertical corridors" or more simply as "two vertical lines."

## Step 3: Generate a new maze of the same size with the same shape for the empty spaces but ensure it is not an identical copy.
To create a new maze that is not an identical copy but retains the same shape for the empty spaces (two vertical lines), we can shift the positions of the empty spaces while keeping the same overall structure. Instead of using columns 2 and 4, we could use columns 1 and 3 for the empty spaces. However, since one of our constraints is to maintain the maze's original size and ensure the path is valid from P to G through empty spaces, we need to adjust the positions carefully.

## Step 4: Determine the new positions for the player and the goal that fit the new maze.
We must place the player and the goal in positions that allow for a valid path through the new empty spaces. Since the empty spaces will now be in columns 1 and 3, we can place the player and the goal in one of these columns.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze.
- Walls will be where the empty spaces are not, considering the new positions of the empty spaces.
- Empty spaces will be in columns 1 and 3, for example, (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), and (4, 3).
- Player position could be at (2, 1), which is within one of the new empty space corridors.
- Goal position could be at (4, 1), providing a path for the player to navigate through the empty spaces.

However, considering the instruction for generating a new maze strictly:
- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
- Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)
- Player position: (0, 1)
- Goal: (4, 3)

This ensures that we maintain the original size and provide a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, without duplicating the original maze.

The final answer is:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)
