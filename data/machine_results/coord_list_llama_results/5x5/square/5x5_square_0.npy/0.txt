You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the next step can only be towards the Goal (G) on the Y-axis, which is down from the current position (P). However, the maze layout allows for movement in all four directions (up, down, left, right) as long as the destination is an empty space. Given the player's current position at (3, 2) and the goal at (3, 0), moving left (on the X-axis) towards the goal directly may not be possible due to the presence of a wall at (3, 1), but moving up to (2, 2) first, which is an empty space, is a viable and necessary step to eventually reach the goal.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the given maze information
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from P to G through empty spaces, avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal position
The current player position (P) is at coordinates (3, 2) and the goal position (G) is at coordinates (3, 0).

## Step 3: Consider the possible movements from the current position
Given the player's position at (3, 2), the possible movements are up, down, left, or right, as long as the destination is an empty space. The goal is to reach (3, 0), but there's a wall at (3, 1) blocking direct leftward movement.

## Step 4: Choose the next step by evaluating the possible movements
Since moving directly left to (3, 1) is blocked by a wall, and moving down is not towards the goal, we look at other options. Moving up from (3, 2) to an empty space would be the logical first step to approach the goal indirectly and avoid the wall at (3, 1). Given the empty spaces provided, moving up from (3, 2) to (2, 2) is a viable first move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the updated maze information
After the last move, the player is now at (2, 2). The goal remains at (3, 0), and the wall at (3, 1) still blocks direct access to the goal from the left (from the current X-axis perspective of the player).

## Step 2: Consider the possible movements from the current position
From (2, 2), the player can move up, down, left, or right to an empty space. Moving left would take the player further away from the goal, and moving down is not possible due to the wall at (2, 3).

## Step 3: Choose the next step by evaluating the possible movements
Given the empty spaces, moving right from (2, 2) to (3, 2) would bring the player closer to the goal's X-coordinate but still above the goal due to the wall at (3, 1). However, moving up from (2, 2) to (2, 1) is a better option since it aims to bypass the wall at (3, 1) by moving towards an empty space that could potentially lead around the wall.

## Step 4: Re-evaluate the proximity to the goal after considering the wall at (3, 1)
Realizing that moving right does not directly solve the issue with the wall blocking the path and considering the need to move towards the goal with flexibility, moving left from (2, 2) to (2, 1) actually corrects the direction towards the goal's Y-axis coordinate indirectly by positioning for a future move around the wall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the updated maze information
The player is now at (2, 1), which is closer to bypassing the wall at (3, 1) to reach the goal at (3, 0).

## Step 2: Consider the possible movements from the current position
From (2, 1), the player can move up, down, left, or right to an empty space. Moving right is blocked by the wall at (3, 1), and moving down would not bring the player closer to the goal.

## Step 3: Choose the next step by evaluating the possible movements
The most logical move is to move up from (2, 1) to (2, 0), which brings the player closer to the goal's Y-coordinate and positions for a potential future move around the wall at (3, 1).

## Step 4: Confirm the next step's validity
Since (2, 0) is an empty space and moving there does not violate any maze rules, this move is confirmed as the next step.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  0\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the updated maze information
The player is now at (2, 0), directly left of the goal at (3, 0).

## Step 2: Consider the possible movements from the current position
From (2, 0), the player's goal is within reach since there's no wall directly between the player's position and the goal's position.

## Step 3: Choose the next step by evaluating the possible movements
Since there are no obstacles between the player and the goal, moving directly right from (2, 0) to (3, 0) achieves the goal.

## Step 4: Confirm the next step's validity
This move is valid because (3, 0) is not a wall and is the goal position. This final move completes the maze.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  0\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
Based on the coordinates of the empty spaces in the original maze, it appears that they form a shape that can be described as a "staircase" or more specifically, a "right-angled zigzag" or "L-shape with steps". However, simplifying the description to a basic geometric or common shape, the empty spaces roughly form an "L-shape".

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same size and shape of empty spaces
To create a new maze with the same size (5x5) and the same L-shape formed by the empty spaces, we need to redefine the positions of the walls, empty spaces, player position (P), and goal position (G). The new maze should not be an identical copy of the original but should retain the L-shape in its empty spaces.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Given the constraints, a new maze can be defined as follows:
- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
- Player position (P): (4, 0)
- Goal position (G): (1, 2)

## Step 4: Verify the new maze meets the criteria
- Same size as the original: Yes, it's a 5x5 maze.
- Includes a valid path from P to G: Yes, a path exists through the empty spaces.
- Not an identical copy of the original: Yes, the wall and empty space positions are different.
- Empty spaces form an L-shape: Yes, the general shape of the empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape.

The final answer is:

For the general shape: L-shape.

For the new maze:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal position: (1, 2)
