You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

From the player's current position (3, 2), I can move up, down, left, or right. Considering the empty spaces, I can move to either (3, 1) or (2, 2).

However, since the goal is to reach (3, 0), moving to (3, 1) seems like a more direct path.

So, my next move would be to (3, 1).

But wait, there's a wall at (3, 1)! That's not a valid move.

In that case, I'll move to (2, 2), which is an empty space.

My next move is to (2, 2).

Please update the maze and let me know the new situation.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

From my current position (2, 2), I can move up, down, left, or right. Considering the empty spaces, I can move to either (2, 1) or (2, 0) (moving left) or (3, 2) (moving down).

Since my goal is to reach (3, 0), I should try to get as close to the goal as possible. Moving to (3, 2) won't get me closer to the goal, but moving to (2, 1) or (2, 0) might provide an opportunity to move down to row 3 later.

I will move to (2, 1) because it's one step closer to the goal, and it leaves more options for the next move.

My next move is to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

From my current position (2, 1), I can move up, down, left, or right. Considering the empty spaces, I can move to either (2, 0) or (2, 2).

Moving to (2, 2) would take me away from the goal, but moving to (2, 0) would put me in a good position to try to move down to row 3 and reach the goal.

My next move is to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting close to the goal!

From my current position (2, 0), I need to find a way to move down to row 3. However, there is a wall at (3, 1) and no empty space at (3, 0) that I can move to directly.

My best option is to move to an adjacent empty space that might allow me to move down to row 3 later. I can move to (2, 1), which I've been to before, but this time it will give me an opportunity to explore other options.

My next move is to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Back to (2, 1) again!

I need to think of a different approach to reach the goal. Let me analyze the situation again.

Since I'm stuck on row 2, I need to find a way to move down to row 3. I've already tried moving down from (2, 0) and (2, 1), but that didn't work.

This time, I'll try moving to (2, 2) and see if I can move down from there.

My next move is to (2, 2).

(But I have a plan brewing in the back of my mind...)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm at (2, 2) now!

I was thinking that if I can move to (3, 2), I might be able to find a way to move left to (3, 1) and then to (3, 0). But wait, there's a wall at (3, 1)!

However, I still want to try moving to (3, 2) because it's a step closer to the goal row. Maybe I can figure out a way to move left or find another path once I'm on row 3.

My next move is to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm at (3, 2) now, and my goal is (3, 0). Unfortunately, I'm stuck because there's a wall at (3, 1) that prevents me from moving left directly.

However, I can try to move up or down and see if I can find another path. Since moving down would take me further away from the goal, I'll try moving up.

Wait, there's no empty space above me to move to. That's a dead end.

In that case, I need to think outside the box... or rather, think about moving to a different part of the maze that might eventually lead me to the goal.

Since I've explored the upper part of the maze already, I'll try moving down to the lower part. Maybe I can find a path that will allow me to move left and eventually reach the goal.

I'll move down to row 4, which means my next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm at (4, 2) now.

Since I've moved down to row 4, my next move should be to explore the left side of the maze on this row. I can see that there are empty spaces at (4, 1) and (4, 0).

I'll move left to (4, 1). Maybe I can find a way to move up to row 3 from there.

My next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm at (4, 1) now.

Since my goal is to move up to row 3, but there's a wall at (3, 1) that prevents me from doing so, I'll keep moving left to see if I can find another way up.

My next move is to (4, 0). Maybe I can find a path up from there.

(And I'm starting to see a glimmer of hope!)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm at (4, 0) now, and I'm so close to the goal!

Since my goal is (3, 0) and I'm directly below it, I just need to move up one step.

My next move is to (3, 0).

(Fingers crossed that I've finally solved the maze!)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "U-shaped" or "Crescent-shaped"

The empty spaces in the original maze form a curved path that resembles a U or a crescent shape, with the player starting at the bottom of the curve and the goal located at the top.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar U-shaped or crescent-shaped path:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and has a U-shaped or crescent-shaped path formed by its empty spaces.
