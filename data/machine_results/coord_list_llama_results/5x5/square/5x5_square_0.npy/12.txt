You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

From the player's current position (3, 2), I can move up, down, left, or right. Considering the empty spaces, I can move to either (3, 1) or (2, 2).

However, moving to (3, 1) would put me in a position where I'm adjacent to a wall, and it doesn't seem to provide a clear path to the goal.

On the other hand, moving to (2, 2) appears to be a more promising option, as it opens up possibilities for further movement and potentially creates a path to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 2).

New player position: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

From my current position (2, 2), I have a few options:

1. Move up to (2, 1): This seems like a reasonable choice, as it might help me get closer to the goal.
2. Move left to (2, 1) and then potentially to (2, 0): This could be a good option, but it might not directly lead me to the goal.
3. Move right to (2, 3): However, this space is a wall, so it's not a viable option.
4. Move down to (3, 2): This space is empty, but it's not clear if it will help me reach the goal.

Considering the options, I think moving left to (2, 1) is the best choice, as it gives me more flexibility for future moves.

New player position: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (2, 1), I have two main options:

1. Move down to (3, 1): However, this space is a wall, so it's not a viable option.
2. Move left to (2, 0): This seems like a promising choice, as it brings me closer to the goal and opens up potential paths.

Considering the options, I think moving left to (2, 0) is the best choice.

New player position: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting close to the goal.

From my current position (2, 0), I need to get to (3, 0). However, I notice that there's a wall at (3, 1) which might block my path.

Considering the empty spaces, I think moving down to (3, 0) directly is not possible because I'll be blocked by the wall at (3, 1). However, I can try to move right to (2, 1) and then potentially down to (3, 2) and finally left to (3, 0) and other movements.

However, there might be a more efficient path.

Move down and left is blocked by a wall at position (3,1), in order to reach (3,0). Only a move down is blocked. It is necessary to go around to reach (3,0) from a different direction that is not blocked.

Considering all this information, to go around I should move right and then try go down.

New player position: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (2, 1), I'll try to move around the wall at (3, 1) to reach the goal (3, 0). My next move will be to move right to (2, 2).

New player position: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue to move around the wall at (3, 1) to reach the goal (3, 0). My next move will be to move down to (3, 2).

New player position: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 2), I'm close to the goal. However, I'm still blocked by the wall at (3, 1). I'll move left to (2, 2), but that would put me back to a previous position.

Instead, my next move will be to move up is blocked by a wall and to the right is also blocked by a wall at (3,3). So I will move left and I will get into one previous position that will allow me more movements. I'm going left.

New player position: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)

Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at (2, 2), I'll try to move around the wall at (3, 1) to reach the goal (3, 0). My next move will be to move down to (3, 2), but that would put me back in a previous position.

Instead, my next move will be to move left to (2, 1).

New player position: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)

Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 1), I can try to move around the wall at (3, 1) to reach the goal (3, 0). My next move will be to move left to (2, 0).

New player position: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm close to the goal, but I still need to figure out how to get around the wall at (3, 1). However, I notice that I can try to move down to (3, 0), but it's blocked by the wall at (3, 1), so I need to find an alternative.

Since I'm at (2, 0), I can try to move right to (2, 1), and then move down to a square (it is blocked), so I move right and try a different movement.

New player position: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 1), I need to find a way to get to (3, 0). However, I notice that I can try to move right to (2, 2), but then I'll need to find a way to move down.

Since (3, 1) is a wall, I'll try to move down to (3, 2) first, and then maybe I can find a way to move left to (3, 0) later.

New player position: not right now to (2,2), but move down isn't possible because is blocked so I move right

My next move is to (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)

 Wait, I was there, isn't other choice than move right and that isn't the correct choice.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "L-Shape with a detour" or more broadly, " Rectangular shape with two corridors connected by a smaller corridor"

To create a new maze of the same size with the same general shape, I'll generate a new maze that meets the criteria. Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (4, 2)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and has a general shape that resembles the "L-Shape with a detour" or "Rectangular shape with two corridors connected by a smaller corridor" formed by its empty spaces.
