You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is at (3, 2), and the goal position is at (3, 0). I notice that the goal is directly above the player's current position. However, I need to check if the intermediate space is empty.

Looking at the list of empty spaces, I see that (3, 1) is not an empty space, it's actually a wall. So, I need to find an alternative path to reach the goal.

Since (3, 1) is a wall, I will move to the right to (4, 2) and then move up. But first, I can move up to (3 is not possible, so) (4 is free), no...  I can move left no... so I can move to the right: no wall: no, there is one, move up to the 2 ... no, there is a wall. I need to move to the left... also no, there is a wall.

One free coordinate in the surrounding 4 possible moves, in relation with the actual position of P,(3.2), I decide I need to go to the position: (4,2)	Vector.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the updated maze.

From my current position (2, 2), I notice that I am closer to the goal, but I still need to navigate around some walls. I see that the space to my right is a wall, and the space below me is also a wall.

However, I can move up to (2, 1) which is an empty space. This move will bring me closer to the goal and give me more options for my next move.

Therefore, my next move is to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the updated maze.

From my current position (2, 1), I can move up to (2, 0), which is an empty space. Alternatively, I can try to move closer to the goal by moving right to (3, 1), but unfortunately, this space is a wall.

So, my best option is to move up to (2, 0), which will bring me closer to the top edge of the maze and potentially give me more options for my next move.

Therefore, my next move is to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Thank you for the updated maze.

From my current position (2, 0), I am just one space away from the goal, which is to my right at (3, 0). However, I notice that (3, 1) is a wall, and I am not sure if I can move directly to (3, 0).

But I will try to move right to (3, 0) because it is the most direct path to the goal, and there is no wall directly in front of me.

Therefore, my next move is to (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "L-Shape"

The empty spaces in the original maze form a rough L-shape, with a horizontal corridor at the top and a vertical corridor at the right.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces in this maze also form an L-shape, with a horizontal corridor at the top and a vertical corridor at the right. However, the maze is not an identical copy of the original, and the walls and empty spaces are arranged differently.
