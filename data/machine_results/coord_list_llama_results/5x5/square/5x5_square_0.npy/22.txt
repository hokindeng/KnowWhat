You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

From the player's current position (3, 2), I can move up, down, left, or right. Moving up would put me at (2, 2), which is an empty space. Moving down would put me at (4, 2), which is also an empty space. Moving left would put me at (3, 1), which is a wall, so that's not an option. Moving right would put me at (3, 3), which is also a wall.

Considering my goal is to reach (3, 0), I should try to move closer to it. Moving up would not bring me closer to the goal, but moving down wouldn't be optimal either. Since I need to reach the goal, which is above my current position, I will choose to move up.

My next move would be to (2, 2).

Please update the maze and let me know the new situation. I will then plan my next move accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

From my current position (2, 2), I can move up, down, left, or right. Moving up would put me at (1, 2), which is a wall. Moving down would put me at (3, 2), which is an empty space. Moving left would put me at (2, 1), which is an empty space. Moving right would put me at (2, 3), which is a wall.

Considering my goal is to reach (3, 0), I should try to move closer to it. Moving down would put me at (3, 2), but it would not bring me closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate, which is more important in this case. Since I need to reach the goal, which is below and to the left of my current position in terms of the x-coordinate's goal value of 3, I will choose to move left.

My next move would be to (2, 1).

Please update the maze and let me know the new situation. I will then plan my next move accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

From my current position (2, 1), I can move up, down, left, or right. Moving up would put me at (1, 1), which is a wall. Moving down would put me at (3, 1), which is also a wall. Moving left would put me at (2, 0), which is an empty space. Moving right would put me at (2, 2), which is also an empty space.

Considering my goal is to reach (3, 0), I should try to move closer to it. Moving right would not bring me closer to the goal. However, moving left would put me at (2, 0), and I could potentially move down from there, but the wall at (3, 1) is still in the way. But I will move left to explore other possible paths that may arise.

My next move would be to (2, 0).

Please update the maze and let me know the new situation. I will then plan my next move accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

From my current position (2, 0), I can move up, down, left, or right. Moving up would put me at (1, 0), which is a wall. Moving down would put me at (3, 0), which is my goal, but I should check if I can actually move there. Moving left would put me at (1, 0) but in the negative direction on the x axis  which is a wall, but is not even a consideration. Moving right would put me at (2, 1), which is an empty space.

Since moving down would put me directly at the goal, I will check the list of walls, and (3, 0) is not on that list, so it is actually possible for me to reach my goal now.

My next move would be to (3, 0).



Please let me know if I have solved the maze correctly.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "L-Shape" or "Angle"

The empty spaces form a distinctive L-shape, with two segments meeting at a right angle.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-Shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, and it includes a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces. The general shape formed by the empty spaces is recognizable as an L-Shape.
