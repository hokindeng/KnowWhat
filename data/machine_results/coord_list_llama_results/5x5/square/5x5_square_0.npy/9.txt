You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is (3, 2) and the goal is (3, 0). The player needs to move up to reach the goal. However, there is a wall at (3, 1) blocking the direct path. 

To find a way around the wall, I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. I can move left to (2, 2), but it will not bring me closer to the goal. However, moving left to (2, 2) would allow me to then move up to (2, 1) and then up again to (2, 0), but this does not directly lead to the goal.

A better option would be to examine if there is a path to move right and then up. Moving right to (4, 2) could be a possible first step. 

Therefore, my next move will be to (4, 2) since it presents a possibility to reach the goal in subsequent steps.

Next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is (4, 2) and the goal is (3, 0). I need to move closer to the goal. I can move up to (4, 1) or left to (3, 2), but the latter would put me back to the previous position.

Moving up to (4, 1) would allow me to then move up again to (4, 0), but I would still need to find a way to move left to reach the goal. However, this path presents a possibility.

Another option is to examine if there is a path to move left and then up. Moving left to (3, 2) would not be beneficial as previously established.

Considering my current options, moving up to (4, 1) seems the most viable next step, as it opens up possibilities for subsequent moves.

Next move: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is (4, 1) and the goal is (3, 0). I need to move closer to the goal. Moving left to (3, 1) is not possible since it's a wall. 

I can move up to (4, 0) or down to (4, 2), but moving down would not bring me closer to the goal. 

Moving up to (4, 0) would allow me to then examine possible paths to move left to reach the goal.

Considering my current options, moving up to (4, 0) seems the most viable next step.

Next move: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is (4, 0) and the goal is (3, 0). Since the goal is directly left of my current position, I will try to move left.

There are no walls at position (3, 0), it is the goal. However, it does not explicitly state it is an empty space. Based on the options I have, moving left is my best course of action to reach the goal.

Next move: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "staircase".

Here is a new maze with the same size, shape, and characteristics:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

In this new maze, the empty spaces also form a "staircase" shape, but with some modifications to the original layout. Note that this is just one possible example of a maze with the same shape, and there may be others that fit the criteria as well.
