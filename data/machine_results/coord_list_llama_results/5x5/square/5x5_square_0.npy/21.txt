You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since I'm currently at position (3, 2) and the goal is to reach (3, 0), I'll try to move in the direction that gets me closer to the goal.

Considering the empty spaces around me, my options are:

* (3, 1) is blocked by a wall, so I cannot move there.
* (2, 2) is an empty space, and moving there will allow me to potentially move closer to the goal in the next step.
* (4, 2) is an empty space, but moving there will not get me closer to the goal.

Given the options, I'll choose to move to (2, 2). This position provides the possibility of moving closer to the goal in the next step.

My next move is to position (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2, 2) and need to get closer to the goal at (3, 0). Considering the empty spaces around me, my options are:

* (2, 1) is an empty space and moving there will get me closer to the goal horizontally.
* (2, 0) is also an empty space and seems like a good option, but I'd rather move to (2, 1) first, as it keeps me in a more central position and allows me to potentially move up or down in the next step.
* Moving to (3, 2) would put me back where I started, so that's not a good option.
* Moving to any of the (4, x) spaces would take me away from the goal.

I'll choose to move to (2, 1). This position gets me closer to the goal horizontally and keeps my options open for the next step.

My next move is to position (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2, 1) and still need to get to the goal at (3, 0). Considering the empty spaces around me, my options are:

* (2, 0) is an empty space and moving there will get me even closer to the goal horizontally.
* (2, 2) is an empty space, but moving there would take me away from the goal.
* I still can't move to (3, 1) due to the wall.
* Moving to any of the (4, x) spaces would take me away from the goal.

I'll choose to move to (2, 0). This position gets me as close as possible to the goal horizontally and sets me up for a potential vertical move in the next step.

My next move is to position (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2, 0) and still need to get to the goal at (3, 0). Considering the empty spaces around me, my only option to get closer to the goal is to try to move down.

Unfortunately, I don't see a direct path from (2, 0) to (3, 0) since there's a wall at (3, 1). However, I can try to move around the wall by first moving down and then left.

My next move is to position doesn't directly get me closer, however I'll move down to (3 isn't available so I'll try to move to) (no (3,0) yet so I try to approach from the right side so it would be)  (no other y on this x =2 so move on x+1 where there's a possibility move to left next) that would be: (3,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "Z" shape or a "zigzag" shape.

Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form a similar "Z" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Note that this new maze has a different layout than the original, but still forms a "Z" shape with the empty spaces.
