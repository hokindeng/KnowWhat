You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move. Based on the current player position (3, 2) and the goal position (3, 0), I see that I can move left towards the goal. My next move will be to the position (3, 1).

But wait, (3, 1) is a wall! So, my next move will be to the position (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (2, 2), I see that I can move left or right to adjacent empty spaces, or I can try to move up or down. My goal is to reach (3, 0).

My next move will be to the position (2, 1).

This move gets me closer to the goal and sets me up for potential future moves.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (2, 1), I see that I can move left, right, up or down. My goal is to reach (3, 0). 

However, I notice that (3, 1) is a wall, which blocks my direct path to the goal. I need to find a way around it.

My next move will be to the position (2, 0).

This move gets me closer to the goal and potentially sets me up to navigate around the wall at (3, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) The shape formed by the empty spaces appears to be a variation of an "L-shape" or a "bent corridor" that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please note that this new maze meets the criteria, having the same size as the original, a valid path from P to G, and a recognizable "L-shape" or "bent corridor" formed by its empty spaces.
