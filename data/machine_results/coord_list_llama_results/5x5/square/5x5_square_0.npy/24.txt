You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is (3, 2) and the goal is (3, 0). The shortest path would be to move up to (3, 1), but unfortunately, it's blocked by a wall at (3, 1). So, the next best option is to move left or right. Since moving right would lead to a wall at (3, 3) and (3, 4), I'll explore moving left.

Moving left from (3, 2) would take me to (2, 2), which is an empty space.

My next move will be to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is (2, 2) and the goal is (3, 0). I'll try to get closer to the goal. Since moving right to (3, 2) would put me in a position where I'd be blocked by the wall at (3, 1), I'll explore moving up or left.

Moving up from (2, 2) would take me to (2, 1), which is an empty space. This would also get me closer to the goal.

My next move will be to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is (2, 1) and the goal is (3, 0). To get closer to the goal, I need to move right and then down, but I have to navigate around the wall at (3, 1). I can try to move up to (2, 0), which would give me the option to move right and then try to go around the wall.

My next move will be to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is (2, 0) and the goal is (3, 0). To get to the goal, I need to move right, but there's a wall at (3, 1). Since the goal is directly to the right, I can try to move right and see if I can reach the goal.

My next move will be to (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag" or a "step" shape.

Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form a similar zig-zag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 0)

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it maintains the same size and a zig-zag shape formed by the empty spaces. The player's starting position and goal position are also changed.
