You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only viable next position is up (north) from the player's current position. However, upon re-examining the empty spaces, it appears there might have been an oversight in considering all available options. Let's re-evaluate the positions:


The player is at (3, 2), and the empty spaces are (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2). Given this, we should consider not just the immediate up direction but also evaluate if moving left or right would provide a path towards the goal.


Given the available empty spaces, moving left directly towards the goal seems more efficient than only moving up.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current player position and goal position.
The current player position is (3, 2) and the goal position is (3, 0).

## Step 2: Determine the valid moves from the current position.
The valid moves from the current position (3, 2) can be up (north), down (south), left (west), or right (east). However, we need to ensure that the desired new position is an empty space and not a wall.

## Step 3: Examine the provided empty spaces to find a valid move towards the goal.
Given the empty spaces are (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), and the goal is to reach (3, 0), we need to find a move that brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move.
Considering we need to move closer to the goal (3, 0) from (3, 2), and taken into account the oversight, moving directly left towards (3, 0) is not immediately possible since (3, 1) is a wall. However, a viable approach is to move towards a position that can eventually lead to the goal.


Given this, an appropriate first move seems to be moving up to (3, 1) is not possible, but we can consider moving to an adjacent empty space that could lead us closer to the goal. However, all direct paths except going up to a position and then left are blocked by walls or lack of empty spaces in the immediate left direction. Moving up to (3, 1) isn't possible because it's a wall. So, considering all options and given no better move has been identified, it appears the best approach might actually align with finding an alternative route that involves moving towards a space that is not directly blocked and could lead to the goal indirectly.


However, re-evaluating the given options and my analysis indicates the oversight was in the explanation of available moves rather than the final choice of direction given the constraints of the maze. The move to an adjacent empty space like (2, 2) or (4, 2) could be considered but since the goal is directly west of the player's position and given the immediate westward move is blocked, considering moves that directly address reaching the goal should be prioritized.


Given the original and re-evaluation analysis might suggest different priorities, the correct next step should prioritize reaching the goal via the shortest path possible, which was not fully articulated in the initial incorrect assumption.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
Given the correct format but an oversight in the actual movement provided in the prompt. Let's re-analyze and correct the movement based on the current state of the maze.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current player position and goal position.
The current player position is (4, 2) and the goal position is (3, 0).

## Step 2: Determine the valid moves from the current position.
The valid moves from the current position (4, 2) can be up (north), down (south), left (west), or right (east). However, we need to ensure that the desired new position is an empty space and not a wall.

## Step 3: Examine the provided empty spaces to find a valid move towards the goal.
Given the empty spaces are (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), and the goal is to reach (3, 0), we need to find a move that brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move.
Since moving directly towards the goal is not possible due to the wall in (3, 1), a strategic approach is needed. An option would be to move left from (4, 2) to (3, 2), as this could provide a more direct path closer to the goal by avoiding the immediate obstruction caused by the wall at (3, 1), and preparing for a potential up or further left move in the future steps.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
Given the maze analysis provided earlier, let's re-analyze and identify the shape formed by the empty spaces and create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same shape.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces.
Based on the empty spaces provided (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), the shape resembles an "L" or inverted "L" (Γ) shape in both the upper and lower parts of the maze.


## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same shape.
To create a new maze meeting the specified criteria, we need to:
- Keep the maze size 5x5.
- Include a valid path from P to G through empty spaces.
- Ensure the new maze is not an identical copy of the original.
- The general shape of its empty spaces should resemble an "L" or inverted "L" (Γ) shape.

Here's a new maze setup:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal position: (2, 0)


This new setup maintains the same 5x5 size, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and includes a path from the player to the goal through empty spaces forming an "L" or inverted "L" shape, which fulfills the required criteria.


The final answer is:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal position: (2, 0)
