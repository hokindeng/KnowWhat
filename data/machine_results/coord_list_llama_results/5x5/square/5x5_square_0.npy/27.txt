You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The incorrect assumption in Step 4 is that since the destination (G) is to the left and down from the current player position (P), the correct move is down because there is a wall to the left. However, the correct approach would be to move left, not down, as the wall to the left doesn't prevent the player from moving left and then reaching the goal in the next step.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current player position and the goal position.
The current player position is given as (3, 2) and the goal position is given as (3, 0).

## Step 2: Analyze the empty spaces around the current player position.
We can see that the empty spaces around the player position are (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), and (4, 2).

## Step 3: Determine the possible moves.
To move towards the goal, we can go left.

## Step 4: Choose the correct move based on the goal position.
Since our destination (G) is directly to the left from our current player position (P), we should prefer to move left.

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the next move.
The correct next move is to the left, which would result in the player position being (3, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. Name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors):**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the maze is an "L-shape" or a combination of two rectangles.

**2. New maze with empty spaces that form the same shape:**

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 2)

Note that the new maze has the same size as the original, and its empty spaces form a recognizable "L-shape" or a combination of two rectangles. The maze includes a valid path from the player position to the goal position through empty spaces, and it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
