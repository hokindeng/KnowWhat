You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is (3, 2) and the goal is (3, 0). The player needs to move up to reach the goal. Since the player can only move to an empty space, I will look at the adjacent empty spaces.

According to the empty spaces list, (2, 2) and (4, 2) are adjacent to the current player position, but moving to these spaces would not bring the player closer to the goal. However, I notice that (2, 1) and (4, 1) are also empty, but more importantly, (2, 1) and (4, 1) are adjacent to empty spaces that are on the same column as the goal (column 0).

But since (3, 1) is a wall, I need to move around it. To move up, the player needs to go left or right first, and then move up. In this case, I can move to (2, 2) first and then move up.

Therefore, my next move is to (2, 2).

(Note that the full path may require multiple moves, but for now, I only need to provide the next move.)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

Since the player position is (2, 2) and the goal is (3, 0), I notice that I can move up to (2, 1) which is an empty space. This move brings me closer to the goal and also prepares me for the next move to navigate around the wall at (3, 1).

Therefore, my next move is to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

Since the player position is (2, 1) and the goal is (3, 0), I need to move around the wall at (3, 1) to reach the goal. I can do this by moving down to (2, 0), which is an empty space. From (2, 0), I can reassess my options to get closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the situation again.

Since the player position is (2, 0) and the goal is (3, 0), I need to move right to reach the goal. However, there is a wall at (3, 1) which prevents a direct move to the goal.

Instead, I can move right to the next column, but since (3, 0) is the goal and (3, 1) is a wall, my only option is to move further right and try to find an alternative path to the goal.

But wait, I can move down from my current position to move right indirectly. I can move to (4, 0) which is an empty space.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 0),

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "U-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size, but with a different configuration of walls and empty spaces, while maintaining the U-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

This new maze meets the criteria, as it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is also recognizable as a "U-shape".
