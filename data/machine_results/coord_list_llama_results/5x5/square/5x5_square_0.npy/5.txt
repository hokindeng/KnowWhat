You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is (3, 2) and the goal is (3, 0). The player needs to move up to reach the goal. However, there is a wall at (3, 1) blocking the direct path.

The empty spaces available near the player position are (2, 2) and (4, 2). To move towards the goal, the best option is to move left to (2, 2), which will give us the opportunity to move up towards the goal in the next step.

My next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is (2, 2) and the goal is (3, 0). To move towards the goal, I need to move up and then right.

The empty space (2, 1) is available above the current position, which brings us closer to the goal. Moving up to (2, 1) will give us the opportunity to move towards the goal in the next step.

My next move is to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is (2, 1) and the goal is (3, 0). Since there is a wall at (3, 1), I need to move around it.

The empty space (2, 0) is available to the left of the current position, which brings us closer to the goal. Moving left to (2, 0) will give us the opportunity to move towards the goal in the next step.

My next move is to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is (2, 0) and the goal is (3, 0). We are now directly adjacent to the goal position, but we need to navigate around the wall at (3, 1).

The empty space that would allow us to get closer to the goal is not directly adjacent. However, since the goal is directly to the right, we need to navigate the wall (3,1). We can only reach the goal by going down and then right then up around the wall at (3,1). The most efficient path is to move down and then move around the wall.

My next move is to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is (2, 1) and the goal is (3, 0). To move around the wall at (3, 1), we need to move down and then right.

The empty space (2, 2) is available below the current position, which will allow us to move down and start navigating around the wall.

My next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is (2, 2) and the goal is (3, 0). We are now in position to move right, towards the goal.

The empty space (3, 2) is available to the right of the current position, which brings us closer to the goal. Moving right to (3, 2) will give us the opportunity to move towards the goal in the next step.

My next move is to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is (3, 2) and the goal is (3, 0). Since we are already on the same x-coordinate as the goal, we need to move up towards the goal.

However, the wall at (3, 1) is blocking our direct path. We need to navigate around it.

Unfortunately, we can't move directly up, but we can try to move left and then up. But this doesn't help us because of the walls on the left side.

Let's try another approach. We can move down to (4, 2) and then move left to (4, 0) and then move up to (3, 0).

So, the next step is to move down to (4, 2).

My next move is to (4, 2).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is (4, 2) and the goal is (3, 0). Our plan is to move left to (4, 0) and then move up to the goal.

The empty space (4, 1) is available to the left of the current position, which brings us closer to the goal. Moving left to (4, 1) is the next step in our plan.

My next move is to (4, 1).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

The player position is (4, 0) and the goal is (3, 0). Since we are on the same y-coordinate as the goal, we can now move directly towards it.

The goal (3, 0) is available to the left and up is not needed, we can directly move to the goal by going left.

My next move is to (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "U-shaped" or " Rectangular U-shape"

To create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same shape, I have generated the following:

(2) New Maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze (5x5), and its empty spaces form a U-shaped corridor. The maze is solvable from the player position to the goal.
