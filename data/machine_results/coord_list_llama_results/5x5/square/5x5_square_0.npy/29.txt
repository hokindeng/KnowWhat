You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since I'm currently at position (3, 2) and the goal is to reach (3, 0), I'll try to move in the direction that gets me closer to the goal.

Considering the empty spaces around me, my options are:

* (3, 1) is blocked by a wall, so I cannot move there.
* (2, 2) is an empty space, and moving there will allow me to potentially move closer to the goal in the next step.
* (4, 2) is an empty space, but moving there will not get me closer to the goal.

Given the options, I'll choose to move to (2, 2). This move will give me more opportunities to progress towards the goal in the next step.

Next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (2, 2), I'll consider the empty spaces around me to decide the next move:

* (2, 1) is an empty space and moving there will bring me closer to the x-coordinate of the goal (3, 0). This looks like a promising move.
* (2, 0) is also an empty space, but moving there might limit my options for the next step.

Given the options, I'll choose to move to (2, 1). This move will allow me to potentially move closer to the goal in the next step.

Next move: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (2, 1), I'll examine the empty spaces around me to plan the next move:

* (2, 0) is an empty space, and moving there will allow me to reach the same x-coordinate as the goal (but on the wrong y-coordinate), and also potentially move up towards the goal in the next step, however it is blocked by a wall on the upper left from the player so we can't move up, thus this movement may waste 1 turn, but there aren't any better turns.
* (2, 2) is an empty space, but moving there will take me away from the goal.

Given the options, I'll choose to move to (2, 0). This move will give me a chance to get closer to the goal in the next step.

Next move: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2, 0), and my goal is to reach (3, 0). To get there, I'll consider the empty spaces around me:

* Unfortunately, there is no direct empty path to (3, 0) because (3, 1), (3, 3) and (3, 4) and a wall at (3,1) to the right of my player blocks my path.
* I must go back up at position (2,1) first then to position (3,2) or go further to (4,0), (4,1) or (4,2) then move to position (3,2), so I choose (3,2) because it reduces distance from goal by half.
However both pathways contain 3 moves so they have the same distance.


Given the options, I'll choose to move to (2, 1). 

Next move: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now back at position (2, 1), and my goal is to reach (3, 0). To get there, I'll consider the empty spaces around me:

* I'll move to (3, 2) this time, as it brings me closer to the x-coordinate of the goal.

Next move: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (3, 2), and my goal is to reach (3, 0). Since I'm already on the same x-coordinate as the goal, I just need to move down to reach it. However, the wall at (3, 1) blocks my direct path.

Given this constraint, I'll move to (2, 2) or (4, 2), but both options don't bring me closer to the goal. The optimal movement involves moving to (2,2) then to (2,1) and (2,0) after which I can't proceed, so I have to backtrack to (2,1), move to (3,2) which brings us back to the start,  this is the same if we choose movement to (4,2) so it is just wasting 4 moves, instead of that it's better to go to (4,2), then to (4,1) and finally to (4,0).

Next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (4, 2), and my goal is to reach (3, 0). The next step in the plan is to move to (4, 1).

Next move: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (4, 1), and my goal is to reach (3, 0). The next step in the plan is to move to (4, 0).

Next move: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (4, 0), and my goal is to reach (3, 0). To get there, I need to move left.

However, since (3, 1) is a wall, I need to go back up to (3, 2), then move to (2, 2), then to (2, 1) and finally to (2, 0) after which I can move to (3,0) however but to reach (3,2) I need to take 4 steps back. so to reach goal I will take 8 steps hence, this path is better compared to the path from start.



To reach (3,2) now,

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "U-shape".

Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)


This new maze meets the criteria: it has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy of the original, and forms a U-shape with its empty spaces.
