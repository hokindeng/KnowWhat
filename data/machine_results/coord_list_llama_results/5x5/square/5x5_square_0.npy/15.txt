You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since I'm currently at position (3, 2) and the goal is to reach (3, 0), I'll try to move in the direction that gets me closer to the goal.

Considering the empty spaces around me, my options are:

* (3, 1) is blocked by a wall, so I cannot move there.
* (2, 2) is an empty space, and moving there will allow me to potentially move closer to the goal in the next step.
* (4, 2) is an empty space, but moving there will not get me closer to the goal.

Given the options, I'll choose to move to (2, 2). This position will give me more opportunities to move towards the goal in the next step.

Next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (2, 2), I'll assess the options to move closer to the goal (3, 0).

The available empty spaces around me are:

* (2, 1) is an option, and moving there will allow me to potentially move closer to the goal in the next step.
* (2, 0) is also an option, but it might not be the most direct path to the goal.
* (3, 2) is not an ideal move, as it would put me further away from the goal.

Given the options, I'll choose to move to (2, 1). This position will give me more opportunities to move towards the goal in the next step.

Next move: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (2, 1), I'll examine the options to move closer to the goal (3, 0).

Since there's a wall at (3, 1), I won't be able to move directly to the goal. However, I can move to (2, 0), which is the closest empty space to the goal. From there, I might be able to find a path to the goal.

Given the options, I'll choose to move to (2, 0). This position will put me in a better position to reach the goal.

Next move: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (2, 0), I'll consider the options to move closer to the goal (3, 0).

However, since there's a wall that extends from (3, 1) to (3, 4), and there's no empty space at (3, 0) adjacent to my current position, I won't be able to move directly to the goal.

The available empty spaces around me are:

* (2, 1) is an option, but moving there would take me away from the goal.

Since I've reached a dead end, I'll need to backtrack to find an alternative path to the goal. However, considering the maze structure, I can see that moving to the right side of the maze and then up might provide an alternative path. Given this, I'll choose to move to (4, 0), which will allow me to explore this alternative path.

Next move: No, (4, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "L-Shape" or "Angle"

The empty spaces in the original maze form a path that resembles an L-shape or an angle, with two corridor segments that meet at a corner.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (1, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is also recognizable as an L-shape or angle.
