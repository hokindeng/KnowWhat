You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

From the player's current position (3, 2), I can move up, down, left, or right. Considering the empty spaces, I can move to either (3, 1) or (2, 2).

However, moving to (3, 1) would put me adjacent to a wall, which is not desirable. On the other hand, moving to (2, 2) would keep me in an area with more empty spaces and provide more flexibility for future moves.

Therefore, my next move is to (2, 2).

Please update the maze and provide the new situation. I will be happy to make the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

From the player's current position (2, 2), I can move up, down, left, or right. Considering the empty spaces, I can move to either (2, 1) or (2, 0).

Moving to (2, 1) would still leave me some options for future moves, but moving to (2, 0) would put me in a better position, closer to the goal and with more flexibility for the next steps.

Therefore, my next move is to (2, 0).

Please update the maze and provide the new situation. I will be happy to make the next move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is an "L" shape, consisting of two connected corridors: one vertical and one horizontal.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 1)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original, and has empty spaces that form the same L shape as the original maze.
