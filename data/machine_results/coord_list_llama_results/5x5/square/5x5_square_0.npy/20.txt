You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

From the player's current position (3, 2), I can move up, down, left, or right. Considering the empty spaces, I can move to either (3, 1) or (2, 2).

However, moving to (3, 1) would put me in a position where I'm adjacent to a wall, and it doesn't seem to provide an obvious path to the goal. On the other hand, moving to (2, 2) appears to be a more promising direction, as it opens up possibilities for further movement.

Therefore, my next move will be to the position (2, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2, 2), my options are to move to (2, 1) or (2, 0) to the left, or to move to (3, 2) to the right. However, moving to (3, 2) would put me back to my previous position, which doesn't help.

Between (2, 1) and (2, 0), I'll choose to move to (2, 1), as it's a more conservative move that keeps me closer to the center of the maze and doesn't immediately commit me to a path that might lead to a dead end.

My next move will be to the position (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (2, 1), my options are to move to (2, 0), (2, 2), or try to move to (3, 1), but (3, 1) is a wall, so that's not a viable option.

Since my goal is to reach (3, 0), moving to (2, 0) seems like the most promising direction, as it brings me closer to the goal's x-coordinate and gives me the opportunity to reassess my options from there.

My next move will be to the position (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2, 0). To get to the goal (3, 0), I just need to move to the right. However, I know that (3, 1) is a wall, so I'll need to be careful.

Fortunately, my goal is directly to the right, so I can try to move to (3, 0) directly. If it's not a wall, I'll reach the goal. If it is a wall (which it shouldn't be, according to the goal description), I'll reassess my options.

My next move will be to the position (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "L-Shape" or "Angle"

The empty spaces form a distinctive L-shape, with two connected corridors that meet at a 90-degree angle.

Here is a new maze with empty spaces that form the same shape:

(2) New Maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and forms an L-shape with its corridors. Note that this is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it shares the same general shape.
