You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since I'm currently at position (3, 2) and the goal is to reach (3, 0), I'll try to move in the direction that gets me closer to the goal.

Considering the empty spaces around me, my options are:

* (3, 1) is blocked by a wall, so I cannot move there.
* (2, 2) is an empty space, and moving there might allow me to find a path to the goal.

I decide to move to (2, 2).

My next move is: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2, 2) and need to plan my next move.

To get closer to the goal (3, 0), I'll examine my surroundings:

* (2, 1) is an empty space, and moving there might help me find a path to the goal.
* (3, 2) is also an empty space, but it's not directly leading to the goal.

I decide to move to (2, 1).

My next move is: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2, 1). Since I'm close to the goal, which is at (3, 0), I want to try to move as close as possible to it.

Considering the walls around me, I see that there is a wall at (3, 1), which blocks my way. However, I can move to (2, 0), which is an empty space, and then potentially find a way to move up to the goal.

I decide to move to (2, 0).

My next move is: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2, 0), and my goal is to reach (3, 0). I'm very close, but there's a problem: the space at (3, 1) is blocked by a wall, and I don't see an obvious way to directly move to (3, 0).

However, I can see that (3, 2) is an empty space, and I could potentially move there and then find a way down to (3, 0) or... wait, there might be a better option!

Considering my current position (2, 0), I realize that I can try to move to (3, 0) directly. It's not explicitly blocked by a wall, so I'm hoping it's a valid move.

I decide to move to (3, 0).

My next move is: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a "backward L-shape".**

**2. A new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form a backward L-shape:**

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Note that the empty spaces in this new maze form a backward L-shape, similar to the original maze, but with some modifications to ensure it's not an identical copy.
