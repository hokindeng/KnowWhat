You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the next best move from the player's position (3,2) would be to move up one unit to (3,1). However, (3,1) is actually listed as a wall, not an empty space. This mistake renders the entire solution incorrect because it suggests moving into a wall, which is not a valid or possible move in the maze.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Map out the maze
First, we need to understand the layout of the maze by plotting the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position on a 2D grid.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From the player position (3,2), we can move in four possible directions: up, down, left, or right. However, we can only move to empty spaces.

## Step 3: Analyze the surroundings of the player position
Given the layout of the maze and the rules for movement, we examine the spaces adjacent to (3,2) to find empty spaces. Since we cannot move into walls, we must carefully avoid those areas.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on getting closer to the goal
Considering the player's current position at (3,2) and the goal at (3,0), we need to find a valid path that moves us closer to the goal while avoiding walls. The only valid move that brings us closer to the goal without moving into a wall is moving left one unit to (2,2), which is an empty space.

## Step 5: Update the position
After deciding on the next move, we update our position to the new coordinates.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the new position and surroundings
Given the updated maze and the player's current position at (2,2), we need to assess the surroundings to determine the next move.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From (2,2), we can move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. We can only move to empty spaces.

## Step 3: Choose the next move based on getting closer to the goal
We are trying to reach the goal at (3,0). To get closer to the goal, we need to move either up or right. However, moving right would put us into a wall at (3,2) is not directly reachable due to the wall at (3,1), so moving up is a more direct path towards the goal. Thus, we should move up one unit to (2,1), which is an empty space.

## Step 4: Update the position
After deciding on the next move, we update our position to the new coordinates.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the new position and surroundings
Given the updated maze and the player's current position at (2,1), we need to assess the surroundings to determine the next move.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From (2,1), we can move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. We can only move to empty spaces.

## Step 3: Choose the next move based on getting closer to the goal
We are trying to reach the goal at (3,0). To get closer to the goal, we need to move either up or right. However, moving right would put us into a wall, so moving up is a more direct path towards the goal. Thus, we should move up one unit to (2,0), which is an empty space.

## Step 4: Update the position
After deciding on the next move, we update our position to the new coordinates.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  0\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the new position and surroundings
Given the updated maze and the player's current position at (2,0), we need to assess the surroundings to determine the next move.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From (2,0), we can move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. However, moving up or left would put us into a wall. We can only move down or right to empty spaces.

## Step 3: Choose the next move based on getting closer to the goal
We are trying to reach the goal at (3,0). To get closer to the goal, moving right would be the most direct path, but there is a wall at (3,1), which means we cannot reach (3,0) directly from our current position. However, we can move down to (2,1) and reassess our options.

## Step 4: Update the position
After deciding on the next move, we update our position to the new coordinates.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the new position and surroundings
Given the updated maze and the player's current position at (2,1), we need to assess the surroundings to determine the next move.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From (2,1), we can move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. However, moving up would put us back to the previous position, and moving right would put us into a wall. We can move down or left to empty spaces.

## Step 3: Choose the next move based on getting closer to the goal
We are trying to reach the goal at (3,0). To get closer to the goal, moving down is not the best option since it would increase the distance from the goal. Instead, moving left would put us back at (2,0), which is closer to the goal, but we've already been there and couldn't reach the goal directly. However, re-examining the maze, we see that moving down to (2,2) could potentially lead to a path to the goal.

## Step 4: Update the position
After deciding on the next move, we update our position to the new coordinates.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the new position and surroundings
Given the updated maze and the player's current position at (2,2), we need to assess the surroundings to determine the next move.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From (2,2), we can move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. However, moving down would put us into a wall. We can move up, left, or right to empty spaces.

## Step 3: Choose the next move based on getting closer to the goal
We are trying to reach the goal at (3,0). To get closer to the goal, moving right would be the most direct path. Moving right would put us at (3,2), which is an empty space and closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Update the position
After deciding on the next move, we update our position to the new coordinates.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the new position and surroundings
Given the updated maze and the player's current position at (3,2), we need to assess the surroundings to determine the next move.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From (3,2), we can move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. However, moving down would put us into a wall, and moving right is not possible since there is a wall at (3,3) and beyond. We can move up or left to empty spaces.

## Step 3: Choose the next move based on getting closer to the goal
We are trying to reach the goal at (3,0). To get closer to the goal, moving up is not directly possible due to the wall above our current position, but moving left and then trying to move up is a potential path. Since we can move left to an empty space at (2,2), this move could bring us closer to finding a path to the goal.

## Step 4: Update the position
However, looking at the map again, if we move left to (2,2), we're essentially moving away from the goal without a clear path upwards. Instead, we should focus on moving up directly and reassess our options from there.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The general shape formed by the empty spaces is an "L" shape, as it has a clear corner and two distinct paths leading to the goal.


## Step 2: Generate a new maze of the same size and shape
To create a new maze, we need to ensure that it meets the criteria mentioned earlier. Here is a new maze that fulfills these requirements:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 2)


This new maze is of the same size as the original and has a valid path from the player position to the goal. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is still an "L" shape, meeting all the criteria mentioned.


The final answer is: There is no final numerical answer for this problem.
