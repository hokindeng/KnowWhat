You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the situation and provide the coordinates of my next move.

From the player's current position (3, 2), I can move up, down, left, or right. Considering the empty spaces, I can move to either (2, 2) or (3, 1) is blocked by a wall, (4, 2) is a possible move, but I want to move closer to the goal. Moving to (3, 1) is not an option as it's blocked by a wall, and (2, 2) seems to be farther from the goal.

Therefore, my next move will be to (4, 2), as it is closer to the goal and an available empty space.

Next move: (4, 2)

Please update the maze and provide the new situation for my next decision.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

From my current position (4, 2), I have a few options: moving to (4, 1) or (3, 2). However, my goal is to reach (3, 0), which is directly above my current position, but unfortunately, there is a wall above my position. I need to find an alternative path.

I notice that moving to (4, 1) would be a better choice, as it brings me closer to the left column, and I might find a path to the goal from there.

Next move: (4, 1)

Please update the maze and let me know the new situation.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (4, 1), I have two options: moving to (4, 0) or (4, 2). However, I notice that (4, 0) is a more favorable choice, as it brings me closer to the goal and opens up more possibilities for my next move.

I also notice that if I move to (4, 0), I might be able to move up to (3, 0) directly, or if not, I can try to find another path.

Next move: (4, 0)

Please update the maze and let me know the new situation.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (4, 0), I notice that I am directly below the goal (3, 0) and the path to it is not blocked by any walls. I can simply move up to reach the goal.

Next move: (3, 0)

This should solve the maze. Please let me know if I'm correct!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "U" shape or a " horseshoe" shape.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a recognizable "U" or "horseshoe" shape. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, and it includes a valid path from the player position to the goal.
