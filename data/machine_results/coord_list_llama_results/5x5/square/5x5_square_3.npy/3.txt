You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the player can move left to position (3, 3). However, the maze description lists (3, 3) as a wall. This means the player cannot move left to that position.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal
The player's current position is at (4, 3), and the goal is to reach (2, 4). To make a move, we need to choose an adjacent empty space that brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
Given the current position (4, 3), the possible moves are to positions that are adjacent and empty. From the provided maze description, the empty spaces are (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), and (4, 4). Since we are at (4, 3), our possible moves are limited to the empty spaces directly adjacent to us.

## Step 3: Choose the best move
The most direct path to the goal (2, 4) from the current position (4, 3) involves moving upwards and then left to the furthest extent possible, but considering we can only move up, down, left, or right and must avoid walls, we should prioritize moves that reduce the distance to the goal. The space directly up or left of us is a wall, and the goal is diagonally up-left. However, there is no direct diagonal move available in the allowed move set. The closest empty space to the goal that we can reach from our current position, considering the restrictions, would be to move up if possible or right to create an opportunity to move up. However, moving up directly is blocked by walls.

## Step 4: Decision based on possible moves and closing in on the goal
Given that moving directly to the goal is hindered by walls, we assess the empty spaces provided to find the closest approachable position to the goal. Since moving up is blocked by a wall, and moving left is not possible directly due to the presence of a wall at (3, 3), we look for an alternative. We can move to the right to (4, 4), which is an empty space and gets us closer vertically to the goal line, then reassess the available moves from there.

## Step 5: Determine the immediate next move
Since the direct path up and left is blocked, moving right to (4, 4) becomes the logical choice as it moves the player towards the goal's vertical line and sets up potential future moves closer to the goal, given the constraints of the maze.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal
The player's current position is at (4, 4), and the goal is to reach (2, 4). Since we are on the same vertical line as the goal, our objective is to move upwards while avoiding walls to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
Given the current position (4, 4), the possible moves are to positions that are adjacent and empty. From the provided maze description, the empty spaces are (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), and (4, 3). Since we are at (4, 4), our immediate concern is to move upwards.

## Step 3: Choose the best move
Since the goal is directly above us, but there is no direct mention of the space (3, 4) being blocked by a wall in our current line of sight, we should aim to move up if it's available.

## Step 4: Decision based on possible moves and closing in on the goal
Considering the goal is at (2, 4) and there is an empty space at (3, 4), the logical approach is to move up to (3, 4) as it directly closes the distance to the goal.

## Step 5: Determine the immediate next move
Given the analysis, the best immediate move is up to (3, 4), bringing us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal
The player's current position is at (3, 4), and the goal is to reach (2, 4). Since we are one step away from the goal vertically, our objective is to move upwards if possible.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
Given the current position (3, 4), the possible moves are to positions that are adjacent and empty. From the provided maze description, the space directly above us is not listed as empty but is our goal.

## Step 3: Choose the best move
Considering the goal is directly above us, we should check if moving up is a valid option. However, since the maze description doesn't include (2, 4) as an empty space in the list (since it's the goal), we might initially assume it's not an option. But given it's the goal, we can infer it's a valid position to move into since the task is to reach the goal.

## Step 4: Decision based on possible moves and closing in on the goal
The only logical approach, given our objective, is to move up to (2, 4), which is the goal.

## Step 5: Determine the immediate next move
Given the analysis, the best immediate move is up to (2, 4), which concludes our navigation as we reach the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Upon reviewing the original maze, the empty spaces (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), and (4, 4) form a shape that resembles a staircase or an "L" shape with an extension. However, considering the overall configuration, it can be simplified to an "L" shape since the primary movement is in two directions with a turn.

## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same shape.
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it has the same size (5x5) as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and the empty spaces form an "L" shape.

## Step 3: Determine the new positions of the empty spaces and the goal.
Given the shape is an "L", we can orient it differently but maintain its form. One way to do this is to mirror the "L" shape horizontally. However, considering the constraint of the maze size and the need to provide a new layout, we'll adjust the positions of the empty spaces to form a new "L" shape. This could involve starting the "L" from the top-right instead of the top-left, for instance.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original.
For the new maze, we'll set the walls and empty spaces accordingly to maintain the "L" shape but in a new configuration.

## Step 5: Finalize the new maze configuration.
Considering the need for a new configuration that maintains the "L" shape but is not a direct copy, we will adjust the empty spaces. For instance, we can make the up part of the "L" extend from the second row and the perpendicular part of the "L" extend from the second last column, with appropriate adjustments for a continuous path.

The final answer is:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 4)
