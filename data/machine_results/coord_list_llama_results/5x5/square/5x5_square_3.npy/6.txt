You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the player can move freely to the rightmost empty space (4, 4) without considering that it is not adjacent to the current player position. A correct approach should prioritize moving to an adjacent empty space that brings the player closer to the goal or opens up more paths.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the layout of the maze
First, we need to visualize or map out the maze according to the given coordinates for walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position. This will help in planning the path.

## Step 2: Identify possible paths
From the player's position at (4, 3), we need to look for adjacent empty spaces. The empty spaces are given as (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), and (4, 4).

## Step 3: Determine the best move
Given the player's position is (4, 3) and the goal is (2, 4), we should look for a move that brings us closer to the goal or opens up more paths.

## Step 4: Choose the best immediate move
Between moving down to (4, 4) or moving up and left, moving to (4, 4) is a viable option as it is adjacent and keeps us closer to the goal horizontally, and moving to (3, 3) is not an option because it is not listed as an empty space.

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the next move
Considering the information from the previous steps and the options available, the best immediate move from (4, 3) would be to (4, 4), as moving directly towards the goal or closer to it through an adjacent empty space is the most logical step.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution does not exist, as this is the first response after the initial move. A correct approach should prioritize moving to an adjacent empty space that brings the player closer to the goal or opens up more paths.

## Step 4: Choose the best immediate move
The best option from (4, 4) is to move up to (3, 4) as it is adjacent, brings us closer to the goal vertically, and is a listed empty space.

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the next move
Considering the information from the previous steps and the options available, the best immediate move from (4, 4) would be to (3, 4), as moving directly towards the goal or closer to it through an adjacent empty space is the most logical step.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  4\right)}$

## Step 4: Choose the best immediate move
However, moving up from (3, 4) to (2, 4) directly might not be possible since we can only move to listed empty spaces, and (2, 4) is not listed as an empty space but as the goal. But, considering the proximity to the goal and the nature of the maze, it seems logical to attempt moving closer to the goal's x-coordinate, but the maze does not provide adjacent empty spaces that directly lead to the goal.

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the next move
Given the constraints, the most logical step seems to backtrack or explore other paths. However, considering the nature of the maze and the fact that we've moved to (3, 4), the past moves indicate a preference for moving closer to the goal. In the lack of a clear adjacent path towards the goal, and acknowledging the strict format but recognizing the nature of maze solving which might require backtracking or not moving directly to the goal, an oversight suggests reconsideration or moving in the direction that could potentially lead closer or open paths, which would be moving to an adjacent empty space if available. Since no better move is available based on given empty spaces and the need for an answer within constraints, the puzzle as described would ideally call for exploring potential paths such as (3, 2) to proceed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape".


Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The L-shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable, although it is rotated compared to the original maze.
