You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the next best move would be moving left into the empty space directly adjacent to the player's current position, which is (4, 2). However, this decision is based solely on the immediate adjacency without considering the need to reach the goal position. Since the goal is at (2, 4), and the player is at (4, 3), moving left does not directly align with the goal's position, which requires a more strategic approach to navigate through the maze efficiently.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the goal position
The goal position is at (2, 4), which means the player needs to end up at this coordinate.

## Step 2: Determine the direction to the goal from the player's position
Given the player's position at (4, 3), the goal is directly up and to the right. However, due to the maze structure, the player cannot move directly to the goal.

## Step 3: Explore possible paths to the goal
The most direct approach involves moving towards the goal by going around the maze's constraints. Since moving directly left does not align with reaching the goal position efficiently due to the maze's structure, we should consider each move in relation to the goal's location and the maze's constraints.

## Step 4: Select the next move based on the path to the goal
Given the constraints and the need to approach the goal strategically, we analyze the empty spaces that could lead to the goal. Since the goal is at (2, 4) and considering the constraints, the most logical step is to move into a position that allows the player to approach the goal more directly in the subsequent moves. The correct initial move, considering the goal's position and the maze, should actually focus on getting closer to the row of the goal or finding a pathway that allows a more direct advance towards the goal in the subsequent moves.

## Step 5: Map the optimal path considering the goal and constraints
Given the maze's layout, moving directly towards the goal's row or finding a path that efficiently navigates towards the goal while avoiding obstacles is crucial. Thus, we reconsider the possible moves with the aim to either move up or find a pathway that leads to the goal with the least number of moves.

## Step 6: Execute the first move of the optimal path
After reevaluating the goal, the player's position, and the constraints, the correct initial move should be aligned with reaching the goal in the least number of moves possible while navigating through the given maze.

## Step 7: Choose the Move.
However, upon closer inspection and following the strict instructions provided without error, given the nature of the maze and the directive for a step-by-step solution, the realization comes that without a clear path directly to the goal and the strict format to follow, the analysis missed incorporating the exact nature of the instructions into the solution process correctly. The instructions implicitly require a direct approach to the solution within the given format constraints. Therefore, adhering strictly to the format and acknowledging the need for a more precise approach that directly addresses the question's request for the next move based on the given conditions:

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original response does not provide a solution to the problem asked; it only serves as a template.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The empty spaces form a path that visually resembles an "L" shape.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces.
Given the "L" shape appearance of the path formed by the empty spaces, it's appropriate to name this shape "L-Shape."

## Step 3: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming the same "L-Shape."
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we should rearrange the positions of the walls and empty spaces while maintaining an "L-Shaped" path that allows for a valid route from a new player position (P) to a new goal position (G). This new maze must not be an identical copy of the original.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original.
Given the constraints, we should focus on designing a maze where the empty spaces clearly form an "L-Shape," ensuring that there is a clear path from P to G, and that the maze is not a reproduction of the original.

## Step 5: Determine the new maze layout.
For a maze of the same size (5x5) with the empty spaces forming an "L-Shape," consider the following:

- Walls should block direct paths that do not follow the "L-Shape."
- The "L-Shape" should be oriented differently but still recognizable.
- The player's position and goal should be placed in a way that requires navigation through the "L-Shaped" path.

## Step 6: Specify the new maze's details.
Given the requirements and constraints, we should creatively design a maze that embodies the spirit of the challenge.

## Step 7: Finalize the new maze.
 Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

However, the instructions and the detailed format provided necessitate a direct and concise response without further elaboration on the thought process beyond this point.

The final answer is:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)
