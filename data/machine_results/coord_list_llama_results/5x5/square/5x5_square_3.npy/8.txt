You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only viable move is to position (3, 3). However, this is incorrect because it is mentioned in the problem that (3, 3) is a wall. A correct approach should consider all possible movements (up, down, left, right) from the current position and check if the new position is an empty space.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Determine the current position of the player.
The player's current position is given as (4, 3).

## Step 2: Examine the possible moves from the current position.
The player can move up, down, left, or right from the current position. Since the current position is (4, 3), the possible moves would result in the following positions: up (3, 3), down (5, 3), left (4, 2), right (4, 4).

## Step 3: Identify the empty spaces that can be moved into.
Given that the empty spaces are (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), and (4, 4), we need to determine which moves would be valid.

## Step 4: Analyze each possible move against the empty spaces and constraints.
- Moving up to (3, 3) is not valid because (3, 3) is a wall.
- Moving down to (5, 3) is not valid because there's no indication that (5, 3) is an empty space within the given maze.
- Moving left to (4, 2) is valid because (4, 2) is listed as an empty space.
- Moving right to (4, 4) is valid because (4, 4) is also listed as an empty space.


## Step 5: Choose the best move to get closer to the goal.
The goal is located at (2, 4). Since the player needs to get closer to the goal, moving right to (4, 4) does not directly get closer but does allow movement within the maze. However, considering all possible valid moves, moving left to (4, 2) does not directly advance towards the goal but is a valid move. Between the valid options, moving to a position that offers more possibility for the next move is essential. Hence, moving to (4, 4) allows the potential for moving up, which could eventually lead closer to the goal or provide more options for subsequent moves.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original solution approach remains correct as it involves analyzing possible moves and selecting the best option based on available empty spaces and the goal position. The solution provided earlier led to the player moving to (4, 4), which is the current position.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Determine the current position of the player.
The player's current position is given as (4, 4).

## Step 2: Examine the possible moves from the current position.
The player can move up, down, left, or right from the current position. Since the current position is (4, 4), the possible moves would result in the following positions: up (3, 4), down (5, 4), left (4, 3), right (4, 5).

## Step 3: Identify the empty spaces that can be moved into.
Given that the empty spaces are (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), and (4, 3), we need to determine which moves would be valid.

## Step 4: Analyze each possible move against the empty spaces and constraints.
- Moving up to (3, 4) is valid because (3, 4) is listed as an empty space.
- Moving down to (5, 4) is not valid because there's no indication that (5, 4) is an empty space within the given maze.
- Moving left to (4, 3) is valid because (4, 3) is listed as an empty space.
- Moving right to (4, 5) is not valid because it is outside the given empty spaces and might be a wall or out of bounds.


## Step 5: Choose the best move to get closer to the goal.
The goal is located at (2, 4). Since the player needs to get closer to the goal, moving up to (3, 4) is the best option as it directly reduces the distance to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

## Step 4: Analyze each possible move against the empty spaces and constraints.
- Moving up to (2, 4) is the goal, but we must ensure it is a valid move by being an empty space or the goal itself.
- Moving down to (4, 4) is valid because (4, 4) is listed as an empty space, but it moves away from the goal.
- Moving left to (3, 3) is not valid because (3, 3) is listed as a wall.
- Moving right to (3, 5) is not valid because it is outside the given empty spaces and might be a wall or out of bounds.


## Step 5: Choose the best move to get closer to the goal.
The goal is located at (2, 4), which is directly above the player's current position. The best move is to move up to (2, 4), as it directly leads to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "staircase" or "L-shape".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 4)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is also a "staircase" or "L-shape".
