You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the player can move freely in the up or right direction without validating the constraints of the maze. It doesn't check if the potential new position is empty or if it is within the boundaries of the maze.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Validate the current player position and goal position against the given maze layout.
The player's current position is at (4, 3), and the goal position is at (2, 4). These positions are valid based on the given maze layout.

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current player position.
Given the current position (4, 3), we can potentially move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. We need to select the best direction to move closer to the goal position (2, 4).

## Step 3: Check for valid moves by examining the maze layout.
To move towards the goal, we need to consider the empty spaces and avoid walls. The potential move in the up direction would place us at (3, 3), but this is a wall, so it's not a valid option. A move in the right direction is also not possible since we are already at the rightmost wall of empty spaces in our row. We need to consider the most direct valid path to the goal, which involves moving up and then right.

## Step 4: Select the best valid move to make next, considering the layout and the goal.
Upon re-evaluation, the best valid move from (4, 3) is actually to move down to (4, 4) because it's an empty space directly adjacent to the current position and it allows for further movement in the next turn without hitting a wall immediately.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The previous solution correctly validated the current player position and goal position against the given maze layout, determined the possible moves from the current player position, checked for valid moves, and selected the best valid move.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Validate the current player position and goal position against the given maze layout.
The player's current position is at (4, 4), and the goal position is at (2, 4). These positions are valid based on the given maze layout.

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current player position.
Given the current position (4, 4), we can potentially move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. We need to select the best direction to move closer to the goal position (2, 4).

## Step 3: Check for valid moves by examining the maze layout.
To move towards the goal, we need to consider the empty spaces and avoid walls. A move in the up direction would place us at (3, 4), which is an empty space.

## Step 4: Select the best valid move to make next, considering the layout and the goal.
Since moving up to (3, 4) is a valid move towards the goal and does not lead to a wall, this is the best valid move from the current position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Incorrect Step: None.
The previous solution correctly validated the current player position and goal position against the given maze layout, determined the possible moves from the current player position, checked for valid moves, and selected the best valid move.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Validate the current player position and goal position against the given maze layout.
The player's current position is at (3, 4), and the goal position is at (2, 4). These positions are valid based on the given maze layout.

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current player position.
Given the current position (3, 4), we can potentially move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. We need to select the best direction to move closer to the goal position (2, 4).

## Step 3: Check for valid moves by examining the maze layout.
To move towards the goal, we need to consider the empty spaces and avoid walls. A move in the up direction would place us at (2, 4), which is not listed as empty but it is the goal position, and a direct move to the goal is considered valid in the context of maze solving.

## Step 4: Select the best valid move to make next, considering the layout and the goal.
Since moving up to (2, 4) is a direct move to the goal and does not lead to a wall, this is the best valid move from the current position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Upon examining the original maze, the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a backward "L" or a rotated "L" shape, which can be more generally described as an "L-shape."

## Step 2: Generate a new maze of the same size with the same shape formed by the empty spaces.
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we will design it to have an "L-shape" formed by its empty spaces. However, it will not be an identical copy of the original maze.

New Maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (1, 4)

## Note:
The provided new maze maintains the same size as the original, includes a valid path from the player's position to the goal, and features an "L-shape" formed by its empty spaces, meeting the specified criteria.

The final answer is:

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
