You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

From the current player position (4, 3), I can move in the following directions:

- Up: Not possible, as (4, 2) is an empty space, but (3, 3) is a wall.
- Down: Not possible, as it's outside the given maze boundaries.
- Left: Not possible, as (4, 1) and (4, 0) are walls.
- Right: Possible, as (4, 4) is an empty space.

My next move would be to the right. The coordinates of my next move are (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (4, 4).

I can move in the following directions:

- Up: Possible, as (3, 4) is an empty space.
- Down: Not possible, as it's outside the given maze boundaries.
- Left: Possible, as (4, 3) is an empty space.
- Right: Not possible, as it's outside the given maze boundaries.

My next move would be up, as it moves closer to the goal. The coordinates of my next move are (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (3, 4).

Since the goal is directly above my current position, I want to move up. However, I notice that the space directly above me (2, 4) is not listed in the empty spaces. But wait, that's because it's the goal!

Unfortunately, I realize that I made a mistake, and I don't see a clear path to the goal (2, 4) from my current position (3, 4) since (2, 4) is not an empty space that I can move into, but rather the goal itself, and the space to the left of the goal, (2, 3), is separated from me by a wall at (3, 3). 

However, since I need to provide a valid move, I will try to move to the left. The coordinates of my next move are (3, 3) no, wait, that's a wall. Then I can only move left to the space (3, 2), which is an empty space.

My next move is to the left. The coordinates of my next move are (3, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "staircase" or an "L-shape" with an additional extension at the bottom.

To generate a new maze with the same shape, I will create a different configuration of walls and empty spaces. Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Note that the new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and has a staircase or L-shape with an additional extension at the bottom formed by the empty spaces. It is not an identical copy of the original maze.
