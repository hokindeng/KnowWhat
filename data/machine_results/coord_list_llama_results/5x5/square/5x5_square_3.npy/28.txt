You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position is (4, 3), and the goal position is (2, 4).

I can move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. Let's evaluate the possible moves:

Up: (4, 2) is an empty space, which is a valid move.
Down: (4, 4) is an empty space, which is a valid move, but moving away from the goal.
Left: (3, 3) is a wall, which is an invalid move.
Right: (5, 3) is outside the maze, which is an invalid move.

Since the goal is at (2, 4), I want to move closer to the goal. Both moving up to (4, 2) and moving down to (4, 4) would increase the distance to the goal. However, moving up to (4, 2) might provide more opportunities to get closer to the goal in subsequent moves.

My next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from my current position (4, 2).

Up: (3, 2) is an empty space, which is a valid move.
Down: (5, 2) is outside the maze, which is an invalid move.
Left: (3, 1) is a wall, which is an invalid move, and (4, 1) is also a wall.
Right: (4, 3) is an empty space, which is a valid move.

To get closer to the goal (2, 4), I should move up and left. Since I can move up to (3, 2), this is a good opportunity to reduce the distance to the goal.

My next move is to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (3, 2), I will evaluate the possible moves:

Up: (2, 2) is an empty space, which is a valid move.
Down: (4, 2) is an empty space, which is a valid move, but moving away from the goal.
Left: (2, 1) and (3, 1) are walls, which are invalid moves.
Right: (3, 3) is a wall, which is an invalid move, but (3, 4) might be a possible path to the goal.

Moving up to (2, 2) seems to be the best option, as it reduces the distance to the goal and might provide new opportunities to move closer to the goal.

However, I also notice that the goal is at (2, 4), which means I will need to move right at some point. Since (3, 4) is an empty space, moving right to (3, 4) and then up might be a better plan.

My next move is to (3, 4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A Staircase or a Zigzag shape.

The empty spaces form a zigzag or staircase-like pattern, allowing the player to move up and right to reach the goal.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

(2) New Maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 4)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a zigzag or staircase-like pattern, but the orientation and positions of the walls and empty spaces are different from the original maze. The player can still reach the goal by moving through the empty spaces, but the path is distinct from the original maze.
