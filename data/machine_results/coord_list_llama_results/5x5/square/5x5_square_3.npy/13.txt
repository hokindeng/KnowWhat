You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The incorrect assumption in Step 4 is that since the priority is set to move up if possible and there's an empty space above the current position, we should move there next. However, the correct approach should consider the entire path to the goal, not just the immediate next move. Given the layout of the maze and the goal position, a more strategic move would be to move towards the goal in a way that ensures the fewest obstacles and least amount of backtracking. In this case, moving down to (4, 4) would be a better strategic move as it aligns with the ultimate goal of reaching (2, 4) by positioning the player closer to the goal's column and setting up for a clearer path forward.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the player's current position and the goal position.
The player's current position is (4, 3) and the goal position is (2, 4).

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current position.
From the current position (4, 3), the possible moves are to any adjacent empty space. Given the constraints of the maze, we look at the empty spaces provided and see which ones are adjacent to (4, 3). The adjacent empty spaces are (4, 2) and (4, 4).

## Step 3: Choose a move that gets closer to the goal position.
The goal position is (2, 4), which means we need to move towards the left and up from (4, 3) to reach the goal. However, since we can only move up, down, left, or right and must move through empty spaces, we need to find a path that reduces the distance to the goal effectively. Moving left to (4, 2) increases the distance to the goal vertically, and moving down to (4, 4) would increase the horizontal distance but decreases the vertical distance mismatch, aligning the player more directly with the goal column-wise.

## Step 4: Given the priorities and the maze layout, decide the next move.
Considering the need to eventually reach (2, 4) and that moving down to (4, 4) aligns the player with the goal column-wise, preparing for a cleaner path forward, the next move should be to (4, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The previous response correctly analyzed the maze and moved the player down to (4, 4), which is the correct move given the player's position and the goal position.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the player's current position and the goal position.
The player's current position is (4, 4) and the goal position is (2, 4).

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current position.
From the current position (4, 4), the possible moves are to any adjacent empty space. Given the constraints of the maze, we look at the empty spaces provided and see which ones are adjacent to (4, 4). Since the player is at the edge of the maze and can only move within its boundaries, we need to look at spaces above or to the side. The only adjacent empty space is (3, 4).

## Step 3: Choose a move that gets closer to the goal position.
Since the goal position is (2, 4), and we are at (4, 4), moving up to (3, 4) would be the most appropriate move, as it decreases the distance between the current position and the goal.

## Step 4: Given the priorities and the maze layout, decide the next move.
Considering we need to eventually reach (2, 4) and moving up decreases the distance to the goal, the next move should be to (3, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The previous responses correctly navigated the maze, and now the player needs to reach the goal position (2, 4) from (3, 4).


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the player's current position and the goal position.
The player's current position is (3, 4) and the goal position is (2, 4).

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current position.
From the current position (3, 4), the only possible move that gets closer to the goal is moving up, as moving down or left would increase the distance or move into a wall.

## Step 3: Choose a move that gets closer to the goal position.
The goal position is directly above the current position, meaning the player needs to move up to (2, 4).

## Step 4: Given the priorities and the maze layout, decide the next move.
Since the goal is to reach (2, 4) and moving up from (3, 4) achieves this, the next move is to (2, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
The original maze had empty spaces forming a general "L" shape.


# New Maze

Given the size and constraints, we need to create a new maze where the empty spaces also form an "L" shape but are not identical to the original maze.


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (1, 4)


This new maze maintains the "L" shape formed by the empty spaces, provides a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze.
