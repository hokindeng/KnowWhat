You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution suggests moving to (4, 2), which, while a valid adjacent empty space, does not consider the overall optimal path to the goal. A better analysis of the maze reveals that moving to (4, 4) opens up a more direct path towards the goal by potentially allowing a move up into the second row if additional empty spaces are revealed after this move, or continuing to navigate around the walls in the most efficient manner possible.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Assess the current player position and goal position.
The player is currently at position (4, 3) and needs to reach the goal at position (2, 4).

## Step 2: Evaluate the adjacent positions to the current player position.
Considering the possible moves from (4, 3), we look at positions (4, 2), (4, 4), (3, 3), and (5, 3). However, since (3, 3) is a wall and (5, 3) is outside the maze or not mentioned, these are not valid options.

## Step 3: Identify the feasible moves.
The feasible moves are to positions (4, 2) and (4, 4) since they are empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the best move considering the goal position.
Given the goal is at (2, 4), the best immediate move from (4, 3) is to (4, 4) because it maintains the same column as the goal and moves closer to the goal by possibly setting up a future move up into the second row if additional empty spaces are revealed or navigating around the walls efficiently.

## Step 5: Specify the coordinates of the next move.
The coordinates of the next move are (4, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current player position and goal position.
The player is currently at position (4, 4) and needs to reach the goal at position (2, 4).

## Step 2: Evaluate the adjacent positions to the current player position.
Considering the possible moves from (4, 4), we look at positions (4, 3), (3, 4), (5, 4), and (4, 5). However, (5, 4) and (4, 5) are outside the maze or not mentioned, so they are not valid options.

## Step 3: Identify the feasible moves.
The feasible moves are to positions (4, 3) and (3, 4) since they are empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the best move considering the goal position.
Given the goal is at (2, 4), the best immediate move from (4, 4) is to (3, 4) because it moves directly towards the goal.

## Step 5: Specify the coordinates of the next move.
The coordinates of the next move are (3, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current player position and goal position.
The player is currently at position (3, 4) and needs to reach the goal at position (2, 4).

## Step 2: Evaluate the adjacent positions to the current player position.
Considering the possible moves from (3, 4), we look at positions (3, 3), (2, 4), (4, 4), and (3, 5). However, (3, 3) is a wall, (3, 5) is outside the maze or not mentioned, and (4, 4) is moving away from the goal.

## Step 3: Identify the feasible moves.
The most direct and only feasible move towards the goal is to position (2, 4).

## Step 4: Determine the best move considering the goal position.
Given the goal is at (2, 4) and moving directly to it is a valid option, the best move is to move to (2, 4) as it directly reaches the goal.

## Step 5: Specify the coordinates of the next move.
The coordinates of the next move are (2, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
After analyzing the original maze, it appears that the empty spaces form a shape that can be described as an "L-shape" or "L-corridor" since it involves moving in one direction (down) and then turning to continue in another direction (right or left in this context) to reach the goal.


## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size that maintains an "L-shape" for the empty spaces but does not replicate the original maze.
Given the original maze is a 5x5 grid, the new maze must also be a 5x5 grid.


## Step 3: Determine the positions of the walls and empty spaces for the new maze.
To mirror the "L-shape" but make it distinct, the empty spaces could form an "L" that starts from the top-right, goes down, and then extends to the left.


## Step 4: Specify the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal for the new maze.
Walls can be placed to block direct paths and ensure the only solution is to follow the L-shaped corridor.


## Step 5: Encode the new maze.
Given the requirements, a possible maze setup is:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4)


Empty: (0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2)


Player position: (3, 1)


Goal: (0, 4)


This setup maintains an "L-shape" configuration for the empty spaces while ensuring the maze is not an identical copy of the original.


The final answer is: 
walls: $\boxed{(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4)}$, empty spaces: $\boxed{(0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2)}$, player position: $\boxed{(3, 1)}$, goal: $\boxed{(0, 4)}$
