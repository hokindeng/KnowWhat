You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution suggests moving to (4, 2), which, while a valid adjacent empty space, does not consider the overall optimal path to the goal. A better analysis of the maze reveals that moving to (4, 4) opens up a more direct path towards the goal by potentially allowing a move up into the second row if additional empty spaces are revealed after this move, or continuing to navigate around the walls in the most efficient manner possible.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Assess the current player position and goal position.
The player is currently at position (4, 3) and needs to reach the goal at position (2, 4).

## Step 2: Evaluate the adjacent positions to the current player position.
Considering the possible moves from (4, 3), we look at positions (4, 2), (4, 4), (3, 3), and (5, 3). However, since (3, 3) is a wall and (5, 3) is outside the maze or not mentioned, these are not valid options.

## Step 3: Identify the feasible moves.
The feasible moves are to positions (4, 2) and (4, 4) since they are empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the best move considering the goal position.
Given the goal is at (2, 4), the best immediate move from (4, 3) is to (4, 4) because it maintains the same column as the goal and moves closer to the goal by possibly setting up a future move up into the second row if additional empty spaces are revealed or navigating around the walls efficiently.

## Step 5: Specify the coordinates of the next move.
The coordinates of the next move are (4, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
This is a new starting point based on the previous move, not correcting an error but continuing the navigation.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Assess the current player position and goal position.
The player is currently at position (4, 4) and needs to reach the goal at position (2, 4).

## Step 2: Evaluate the adjacent positions to the current player position.
Considering the possible moves from (4, 4), we look at positions (3, 4) and (4, 3) since moving up from (4, 4) directly towards the goal is blocked by walls and there are no empty spaces directly to the right.

## Step 3: Identify the feasible moves.
The feasible moves are to position (3, 4) since it is an empty space and (4, 3) is also a valid move but moving away from the goal in terms of column alignment.

## Step 4: Determine the best move considering the goal position.
Given the goal is at (2, 4), and the desire to move closer to the goal's column, the best immediate move from (4, 4) is to (3, 4) because it moves directly towards the goal while staying in the same column as the goal.

## Step 5: Specify the coordinates of the next move.
The coordinates of the next move are (3, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
This is a new step in the navigation, not correcting a previous error.

## Step 1: Assess the current player position and goal position.
The player is currently at position (3, 4) and needs to reach the goal at position (2, 4).

## Step 2: Evaluate the adjacent positions to the current player position.
Considering the possible moves from (3, 4), we look at positions (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 4). However, since (3, 3) is a wall, it's not a valid option.

## Step 3: Identify the feasible moves.
The feasible moves are to positions (2, 4) and (4, 4).

## Step 4: Determine the best move considering the goal position.
Given the goal is at (2, 4), the best immediate move from (3, 4) is directly to (2, 4) because it directly reaches the goal.

## Step 5: Specify the coordinates of the next move.
The coordinates of the next move are (2, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
This is an analysis of the maze's shape and generation of a new maze.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is an "L-shape".

## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same L-shape.
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it has the same size as the original (5x5), includes a valid path from P to G, is not an identical copy, and forms an L-shape with its empty spaces.

## Step 3: Define the new maze.
New Maze:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

## Step 4: Verify the new maze.
The new maze is of the same size (5x5), includes a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and its empty spaces form an L-shape.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\text{New maze defined above}}$
