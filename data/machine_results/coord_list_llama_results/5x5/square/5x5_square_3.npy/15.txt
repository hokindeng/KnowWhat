You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution suggests moving to (4, 2), which indeed is an adjacent empty space to the current player position and not a wall. However, this move is part of a sequence of moves that doesn't lead to the optimal path for reaching the goal position. A better approach would be to analyze the maze's layout more thoroughly and plan a path that moves more directly towards the goal, considering the constraints and aiming for efficiency.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the maze
First, let's identify the key elements of the maze. The walls are located at specific coordinates, and the empty spaces are also given. The player starts at position (4, 3), and the goal is to reach position (2, 4).

## Step 2: Analyze the possible movements
From the player's starting position at (4, 3), the possible moves are up, down, left, or right into an empty space. Given the layout, the initial move should aim to bring the player closer to the goal while navigating through the empty spaces efficiently.

## Step 3: Determine the shortest path
To reach the goal at (2, 4) from (4, 3) with the given maze layout, we should prioritize moving up and to the left, as moving down would take us further away from the goal, and moving right directly is blocked by the maze's constraints.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the shortest path
Considering the need to move towards the goal, and given the layout of walls and empty spaces, the most efficient next move from (4, 3) is to move up to (3, 3), as it brings the player closer to the goal and is an allowed move within the empty spaces provided.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "staircase".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is still recognizable as a "staircase".
