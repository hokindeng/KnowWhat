You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. 

First, I need to analyze the current player position (4, 3) and find a valid move to an empty space. Since I can move up, down, left, or right, I'll examine the adjacent coordinates:

- Left: (4, 2) is an empty space.
- Right: (4, 4) is an empty space.
- Up: (3, 3) is a wall.
- Down: (5, 3) is not a valid move since it's outside the maze.

My next move will be to an empty space. Since the goal position (2, 4) is located above and to the right of my current position, I will choose to move right to (4, 4) as it brings me closer to the goal. 

My next move is to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the current player position (4, 4) and find a valid move to an empty space. 

Since I can move up, down, left, or right, I'll examine the adjacent coordinates:

- Left: (4, 3) is an empty space.
- Right: No valid move (outside the maze).
- Up: (3, 4) is an empty space.
- Down: No valid move (outside the maze).

My goal position is above my current position, so I will choose to move up to (3, 4) as it brings me closer to the goal.

My next move is to (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the current player position (3, 4) and find a valid move to an empty space. 

Since I can move up, down, left, or right, I'll examine the adjacent coordinates:

- Left: (3, 3) is a wall.
- Right: No valid move (outside the maze).
- Up: (2, 4) is the goal position.
- Down: (4, 4) is an empty space, but I was just there.

Since my goal position is directly above my current position, I will choose to move up to (2, 4), which is the goal position.

My next move is to (2, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "staircase" or an "L-shape" with an additional connecting step.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same staircase shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 4)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and forms a staircase shape with its corridors. However, the specific positions of the walls and empty spaces are different from the original maze.
