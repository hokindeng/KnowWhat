You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. 

First, I need to find a path to the goal position from the current player position. The player is at (4, 3), but since (4, 3) is not explicitly listed as an empty space or a wall in the given information, and for the purpose of this exercise, I will proceed under the assumption that it is indeed an empty space or at least a navigable position since the task implies the player starts there.

Given the current position is (4, 3), and the goal is (2, 4), my first move would be to move to the nearest empty space that brings me closer to the goal. 

Since (4, 4) is an empty space and it's directly adjacent to the goal in the vertical direction (but not directly adjacent to the current position, yet relevant for planning), I'll first aim to reach (4, 4) from (4, 3) by moving right. However, the immediate next step from (4, 3) to get closer to the goal efficiently would involve considering the available empty spaces that directly connect to (4, 3). The direct move to an empty space from (4, 3) without hitting a wall directly leads me to choose moving right to (4, 4), but this isn't immediately adjacent and available as per the initial description. Thus, the logic of moving towards an immediately available empty space dictates moving upwards towards (3, 3), which is listed as a wall, or moving to another direction that has an empty space. The only realistic option given the constraints is to move upwards and find a path or downwards if the scenario allows it, but given the setup, downwards isn't a viable direction since it doesn't bring us closer to any empty space directly that we are aware of, and upwards to (3, 3) is obstructed since it's a wall. 

Thus, considering practical navigation, and, recognizing the immediate misstep in the direct rightward movement plan to (4, 4) without correctly assessing the direct adjacency, the reasonable immediate move, avoiding walls and sticking to provided empty spaces without incorrectly presuming adjacency where it's not directly clear, would involve reassessing the feasible paths given. The intention was to approach the nearest known empty space efficiently from (4, 3), meaning considering a logical mistake in direct rightward assessment.

Reassessing given the fixed scenarios: Since moving directly to (4, 4) isn't an immediately available step without bypassing the logical progression due to my starting point, I'd instead correctly adjust to seek a path through known empty spaces. However, there's been a miscalculation in the immediate rightward move's feasibility due to oversight in the adjacency and path's direct availability from the starting point.

The initial problem understanding aimed at a step towards (4, 4) from (4, 3) but didn't consider the direct step's availability properly due to incorrect adjacency and availability presumptions in the direct rightward move's explanation.

Given this, and adhering strictly to the provided information without assuming moves into spaces not explicitly listed as empty or directly presuming moves that haven't considered the correct path of empty spaces from the player position to the goal in this turn:

Let's accurately redefine the approach based on correct adjacency and the aim to reach the goal position from the current position through explicitly provided empty spaces without the misinterpretation:

The correct next step involves reaching an adjacent empty space. Considering (4, 4) is indeed an empty space, and correcting the oversight on direct moves assuming correct interpretation on explicit space categorizations provided, I move right from (4, 3) towards (4, 4).

Correcting for the logical oversight and understanding that the aim is to reach the goal through the most direct path of empty spaces provided while strictly following the rules and given spaces:

Next move: (4, 4)

It seems there was confusion in the explanation and navigation plan presented initially. The correction aligns with the aim to move efficiently towards the goal using the empty spaces provided.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue navigating through the maze.

Given the current position (4, 4) and the goal position (2, 4), I will move towards the goal, aiming to find a path that avoids walls.

A logical next step is to move up from (4, 4), trying to get closer to the goal. Since (3, 4) is an empty space, I can move there safely.

Next move: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue navigating through the maze.

Given the current position (3, 4) and the goal position (2, 4), I'm close to the goal and need to move up to reach it. Since moving up from (3, 4) directly takes me to the goal, and there are no walls directly above me in this column based on the given information, I can make the move.

However, upon reevaluation, I notice that moving directly up to (2, 4) is the intended goal, and while it aligns with my aim, I need to clarify that this move is being made under the assumption that (2, 4) becomes accessible as I move towards it, aligning with typical maze navigation logic where one moves towards the goal when the path appears to be clear or is revealed as such in progression.

Thus, my next move is to attempt to move directly up to the goal, considering standard maze progression and navigation towards explicitly stated goals.

Next move: (2, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze appears to resemble a letter "L" with some irregularities or can be generally interpreted as forming a roughly angular or bent shape resembling parts of an "L" or a stair-step pattern. However, considering the specific arrangement, a more fitting description might be a bent or corner shape, but for simplicity and general recognition, it can be somewhat likened to an "L" shape, with an additional corridor.

2. Here's a new maze with the same size (5x5) and a path that forms a similar shape. The maze is not an identical copy of the original and includes a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces.

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position (P): (4, 2)
Goal (G): (1, 4)

This new maze maintains the 5x5 size, is not a direct copy of the original, and features a path from P to G through the empty spaces that can be recognized as forming a similar angular or bent shape, resembling an "L" with an adjustment for the additional corridor, maintaining the essence of the required shape in a new configuration.
