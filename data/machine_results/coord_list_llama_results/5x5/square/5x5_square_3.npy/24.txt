You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution suggests moving to (4, 2), which, while a valid adjacent empty space, does not consider the overall optimal path to the goal. A better strategy is to move directly towards the goal when possible.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Determine the current player position and the goal position
The current player position is given as (4, 3), and the goal position is given as (2, 4).

## Step 2: Identify the adjacent empty spaces to the current player position
From the given list of empty spaces, we can identify the adjacent empty spaces to the current player position (4, 3). The adjacent empty spaces are (4, 2), (4, 4), and possibly (3, 3) if it were an empty space, but since (3, 3) is a wall, we cannot consider it.

## Step 3: Choose the best next move
Considering the goal position (2, 4), the best next move would be to move to (4, 4), as it brings the player closer to the goal and sets them up to move up in the next move.

## Step 4: Provide the coordinates of the proposed move.
Based on the chosen next move, the coordinates of the proposed move are (4, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original solution's thought process is correct, but now, we should continue considering the optimal path from the current position (4, 4) to the goal position (2, 4).


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Determine the current player position and the goal position
The current player position is given as (4, 4), and the goal position is given as (2, 4).

## Step 2: Identify the adjacent empty spaces to the current player position
From the given list of empty spaces, we can identify the adjacent empty spaces to the current player position (4, 4). The adjacent empty space is (3, 4), since the other adjacent spaces are either outside the maze or walls.

## Step 3: Choose the best next move
Considering the goal position (2, 4), the best next move would be to move to (3, 4), as it brings the player closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Provide the coordinates of the proposed move.
Based on the chosen next move, the coordinates of the proposed move are (3, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original solution's thought process is correct, but now, we should continue considering the optimal path from the current position (3, 4) to the goal position (2, 4).


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Determine the current player position and the goal position
The current player position is given as (3, 4), and the goal position is given as (2, 4).

## Step 2: Identify the adjacent empty spaces to the current player position
Unfortunately, the given list of empty spaces does not include a direct path to the goal position (2, 4). However, we can infer that (2, 4) must be empty since it is the goal, even though it is not explicitly listed among the empty spaces. The adjacent empty space that moves us closer to the goal is not explicitly listed but can be inferred as the goal itself.

## Step 3: Choose the best next move
Considering the goal position (2, 4), and assuming it is an empty space, the best next move would be to move to (2, 4), as it directly reaches the goal.

## Step 4: Provide the coordinates of the proposed move.
Based on the chosen next move, the coordinates of the proposed move are (2, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Upon examining the original maze, the empty spaces appear to form a shape that can be described as an "L-shape" with additional corridors. However, focusing on the primary path from the player to the goal, the shape can be more specifically recognized as an "L-shape".

## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same L-shape.
To create a new maze, we need to ensure it has the same dimensions as the original (5x5), includes a valid path from the player (P) to the goal (G), is not an identical copy, and its empty spaces form an L-shape.

## Step 3: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original.
The new maze will have the same number of walls and empty spaces, but their positions will be adjusted to create a different maze while maintaining the L-shape formed by the empty spaces.

## Step 4: Define the new maze.
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

However, to correctly align the player and goal with the space defined by the instructions (which doesn't perfectly follow the exact initial generative instructions), we adjust as follows:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 4), (3, 2), (2, 2)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

This corrected maze preserves the L-shape, provides a valid path from P to G, and adheres to the specified format.

The final answer is: There is no single numeric answer to this question as it involves describing a shape and generating a new maze, which cannot be encapsulated in a single number.
