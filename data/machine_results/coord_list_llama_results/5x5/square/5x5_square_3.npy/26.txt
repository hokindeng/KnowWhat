You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. 

First, I need to find the possible adjacent empty spaces to my current position (4,3). Since I can only move up, down, left, or right through empty spaces, I'll analyze these options:

- Up: (4, 2) is empty
- Down: Not possible, since there is no empty space below my current position
- Left: Not possible, since there is a wall to the left
- Right: Not possible, since there is no information about the space to the right

Given these options, my next move will be to the empty space (4, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4, 2), I'll analyze the possible adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: Not possible, since there is a wall above my current position
- Down: (4, 3) is empty
- Left: Not possible, since there is a wall to the left
- Right: Not possible, since there is no information about the space to the right, but (4, 4) and (4, 3) and adjacent so that might be a possibility

However, my ultimate goal is to reach (2, 4), which is above and to the left of my current position. Since I need to move in that general direction, my next move should be upwards when possible. But since that's not possible, I will move in the next best direction. 

Given these options, my next move will be to the empty space (4, 3).

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at position (4, 3), I'll analyze the possible adjacent empty spaces again:

- Up: Not possible, since there is a wall above my current position, but I did notice that two steps above, the (3, 2) and (3, 4) are adjacent so the next best move would be the left of (4, 3) which has no path so we look at the right 
- Down: Not possible, no more empty space down
- Left: Not possible, since there is a wall to the left
- Right: (4, 4) is empty 

My next move will be to the empty space (4, 4).

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4, 4), I'll analyze the possible adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: Not possible, since there is a wall above my current position, but I did notice that  (3, 4) is adjacent 
- Down: Not possible, since I'm at the bottom edge
- Left: (4, 3) is empty
- Right: Not possible, since I'm at the right edge

My ultimate goal is to reach (2, 4), which is above my current position. Since I need to move in that general direction, my next move should be upwards when possible. In this case, I can move up to (3, 4), which gets me closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3, 4), I'll analyze the possible adjacent empty spaces:

- Up: Not possible directly to (2, 4) because I have to go left and then up
- Down: (4, 4) is empty, but I would be moving away from the goal
- Left: (3, 3) is not empty, it's a wall but (3, 2) and (2, 2) then (2, 3) is empty so 
- Right: Not possible, since I'm at the right edge

My ultimate goal is to reach (2, 4), which is above and to the left of my current position. I will move left to (3, 2) first.

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "staircase".

Here is a new maze with the same size, where the empty spaces form a similar staircase shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Note that this new maze is not identical to the original maze, but it shares the same general staircase shape formed by the empty spaces. The path from P to G can be reached through the empty spaces, making it a valid maze to solve.
