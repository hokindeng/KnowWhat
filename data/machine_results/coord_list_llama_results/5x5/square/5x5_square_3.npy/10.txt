You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

From the current player position (4, 3), I can move in the following directions:

- Up (3, 3) -> Wall, invalid move
- Down (5, 3) -> Out of bounds (since there is no empty space at (5, 3)), invalid move
- Left (4, 2) -> Empty space, valid move
- Right (4, 4) -> Empty space, valid move

Since I can only move left or right, I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal position (2, 4). Moving right to (4, 4) is the most optimal move.

My next move is: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (4, 4).

Since I am at the right edge of the maze, moving right is not possible. 

- Up (3, 4) -> Empty space, valid move
- Down is out of bounds, invalid move
- Left (4, 3) -> Empty space, valid move

Considering my goal is at (2, 4), I want to get closer to that column. Moving up to (3, 4) keeps me in the same column as the goal, which is the most optimal move.

My next move is: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (3, 4).

- Up (2, 4) -> Goal position, valid move
- Down (4, 4) -> Empty space, valid move but moving away from the goal, so not optimal
- Left (3, 3) -> Wall, invalid move
- Right is out of bounds, invalid move

Since I can move directly up to the goal position, I will take that move.

My next move is: (2, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as an "L" shape, with a small appendage (the single empty space at (3, 4) and (4, 4)).

Here is a new maze with the same size (5x5) and an "L" shape formed by the empty spaces:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 4)
