You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position is (4, 3), and the goal position is (2, 4).

I can move in four directions: up, down, left, or right. Let's evaluate each option:

*   Up: (4, 2) is an empty space and a possible move.
*   Down: (4, 4) is an empty space and a possible move.
*   Left: (3, 3) is a wall, so this move is not possible.
*   Right: There is no space to the right of (4, 3), so this move is not possible.

Since I need to reach (2, 4), my next move should be (4, 2), as moving up will allow me to potentially reach the goal.

My next move is to position (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position is (4, 2), and the goal position is (2, 4).

Let's evaluate each option:

*   Up: Not possible, as there is no space above (4, 2) in the maze.
*   Down: (4, 3) is an empty space and a possible move.
*   Left: (3, 2) is an empty space and a possible move.
*   Right: (4, 3) and (4, 4) are possible moves, but moving down won't bring me closer to the goal.

Since I need to reach (2, 4), my next move should be (3, 2), as moving left will bring me closer to the goal.

My next move is to position (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position is (3, 2), and the goal position is (2, 4).

Let's evaluate each option:

*   Up: (2, 2) is an empty space and a possible move.
*   Down: Not possible, as (3, 3) is a wall.
*   Left: Not possible, as (3, 1) is a wall and (3, 0) is a wall.
*   Right: (3, 3) is a wall, but (3, 4) is an empty space and a possible move.

Since I need to reach (2, 4), my next move should be (2, 2), as moving up will allow me to potentially reach the goal more directly.

My next move is to position (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position is (2, 2), and the goal position is (2, 4).

Let's evaluate each option:

*   Up: Not possible, as there is no space above (2, 2) in the maze and (1, 2) is a wall.
*   Down: (3, 2) is an empty space and a possible move, but moving down would be opposite of the goal.
*   Left: Not possible, as (2, 1) is a wall.
*   Right: (2, 3) is an empty space and a possible move.

Since I need to reach (2, 4), my next move should be (2, 3), as moving right will bring me closer to the goal.

My next move is to position (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position is (2, 3), and the goal position is (2, 4).

Let's evaluate each option:

*   Up: Not possible, as there is no space above (2, 3) in the maze and (1, 3) is a wall.
*   Down: (3, 3) is a wall, so this move is not possible.
*   Left: (2, 2) is an empty space and a possible move, but moving left would be opposite of the goal.
*   Right: (2, 4) is the goal and a possible move.

Since I need to reach (2, 4), my next move should be (2, 4), as moving right will bring me directly to the goal.

My next move is to position (2, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1.  The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a rectangle/staircase shape. It could be interpreted as a spiral shape with a rectangular component connected to it, containing both straight and angled segments.
2.  Here is a new maze with the same size (5x5) and the same general shape:

    Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4)
    Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
    Player position: (4, 3)
    Goal: (2, 2)
