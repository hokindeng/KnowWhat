You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

From the current player position (4, 3), I can move up, down, left, or right. However, I must ensure that the new position is an empty space and not a wall.

Here are the possible moves:

* Up: (4, 2) - This is an empty space.
* Down: (4, 4) - This is an empty space.
* Left: (3, 3) - This is a wall.
* Right: Not possible, as it would be out of bounds.

Considering the possible moves, I will choose to move up to (4, 2). This position is closer to the goal, and it allows me to potentially move left or right in the next step.

My next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (4, 2).

I can move up, down, left, or right, but I must ensure that the new position is an empty space and not a wall.

Here are the possible moves:

* Up: Not possible, as there is no empty space above (4, 2).
* Down: (4, 3) - This is an empty space, but I already moved away from this position.
* Left: (3, 2) - This is an empty space.
* Right: (4, 3) or (4, 4) are possible moves, but I already moved away from (4, 3) and moving right might not be the best choice to approach the goal.

Considering the possible moves, I will choose to move left to (3, 2). This position allows me to potentially move up or right in the next step, which could bring me closer to the goal.

My next move is to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (3, 2).

I can move up, down, left, or right, but I must ensure that the new position is an empty space and not a wall.

Here are the possible moves:

* Up: (2, 2) - This is an empty space.
* Down: Not possible, as there is a wall below (3, 2).
* Left: Not possible, as there is a wall to the left of (3, 2).
* Right: (3, 3) - This is a wall, but (3, 4) is an empty space, however I can't move there directly.

Considering the possible moves, I will choose to move up to (2, 2). This position allows me to potentially move right or up in the next step, which could bring me closer to the goal.

My next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (2, 2).

I can move up, down, left, or right, but I must ensure that the new position is an empty space and not a wall.

Here are the possible moves:

* Up: Not possible, as there is a wall above (2, 2).
* Down: (3, 2) - This is an empty space, but I already moved away from the area below.
* Left: Not possible, as there is a wall to the left of (2, 2).
* Right: (2, 3) - This is an empty space.

Considering the possible moves, I will choose to move right to (2, 3). This position allows me to potentially move right again in the next step, which could bring me closer to the goal.

My next move is to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the updated maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (2, 3).

I can move up, down, left, or right, but I must ensure that the new position is an empty space and not a wall.

Here are the possible moves:

* Up: Not possible, as there is a wall above (2, 3).
* Down: Not possible, as there is a wall below (2, 3).
* Left: (2, 2) - This is an empty space, but I already moved away from this position.
* Right: (2, 4) - This is the goal position.

Considering the possible moves, I will choose to move right to (2, 4), which is the goal position.

My next move is to (2, 4). This should solve the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) A staircase shape.

The empty spaces formed a staircase-like pattern, connecting the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

(2) New maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G). The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is a staircase shape, similar to the original maze. However, the new maze is not an identical copy of the original.
