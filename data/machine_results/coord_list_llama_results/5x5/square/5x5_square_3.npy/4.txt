You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the player can move freely to the rightmost empty space (4, 4) without considering that it is not adjacent to the current player position. A correct approach should prioritize moving to an adjacent empty space that brings the player closer to the goal or opens up more paths.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Understand the layout of the maze
First, we need to visualize or map out the maze according to the given coordinates for walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position. This will help in planning the path.

## Step 2: Identify possible paths
From the player's position at (4, 3), we need to look for adjacent empty spaces. The empty spaces are given as (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), and (4, 4).

## Step 3: Determine the best move
Given the player's position is (4, 3) and the goal is (2, 4), we should look for a move that brings us closer to the goal or opens up more paths.

## Step 4: Choose the best immediate move
Between moving down to (4, 4) or moving up and left, moving to (4, 4) is a viable option as it is adjacent and keeps us closer to the goal horizontally, and moving to (3, 3) is not an option because it is not listed as an empty space.

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the next move
Considering the information from the previous steps and the options available, the best immediate move from (4, 3) would be to (4, 4), as moving directly towards the goal or closer to it through an adjacent empty space is the most logical step.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution's next step would likely try to move directly towards the goal without considering the walls and the actual empty spaces available for movement.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout
The player is now at (4, 4), and the goal is still at (2, 4). We need to find a path that moves around the walls and through the empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify possible paths
Given the player's position, the empty spaces are crucial for the next move. The empty spaces are (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), and (4, 3).

## Step 3: Determine the best move
The goal is to reach (2, 4), but moving directly up is blocked by walls and non-adjacent empty spaces. We need to find an adjacent empty space that can lead us closer or provide more options.

## Step 4: Choose the best immediate move
The only viable option from (4, 4) that utilizes an adjacent empty space is to move up to (3, 4), as it is the only adjacent empty space that allows us to progress.

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the next move
Considering the information from the previous steps and the options available, the best immediate move from (4, 4) would be to (3, 4), as it is the only logical step towards finding a path to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution's next step would likely try to move directly towards the goal without considering that the direct path is blocked by walls.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout
The player is now at (3, 4), and the goal is at (2, 4). We need to find a path that moves around the walls and through the empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify possible paths
Given the player's position, the empty spaces are crucial for the next move. The empty spaces are (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), and (4, 4).

## Step 3: Determine the best move
The goal is to reach (2, 4), but moving directly up to the goal is blocked by a wall at (2, 1) and other non-adjacent walls and empty spaces. We need to find an adjacent empty space that can lead us closer or provide more options.

## Step 4: Choose the best immediate move
The viable option from (3, 4) that utilizes an adjacent empty space is limited. Since moving towards the goal directly is not possible, and the only adjacent empty spaces are those we've come from or those that don't directly lead to the goal, we should consider backtracking or exploring other routes.

## Step 5: Provide the coordinates of the next move
Considering the information from the previous steps and the options available, a reasonable next move is to backtrack or explore other paths. Given the options, moving to (3, 2) could be a potential step as it opens up more paths for exploration and is an adjacent empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles an "L" shape or a corner path that connects the player position to the goal through a turn.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with empty spaces forming the same shape
Given the original maze's size is 5x5, we will create a new maze of the same size. The new maze should have a path that can be recognized as an "L" shape or a corner path but not be an identical copy of the original.

## Step 3: Encode the new maze
We need to define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position for the new maze.

## Step 4: Define the new maze's layout
For the new maze, let's consider the "L" shape path but orient it differently within the 5x5 grid. We will place the player position at one end of the "L" and the goal at the other end.

## Step 5: Provide the new maze's details
The new maze's layout will have the following positions for walls, empty spaces, the player, and the goal to form a recognizable "L" shape path.

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

However, this new maze doesn't perfectly form the traditional L shape when only considering direct horizontal and vertical lines for the empty spaces. A more accurate L shape should include empty spaces forming a clear corner.

Revised Empty for a clearer L shape while adjusting walls accordingly:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

This revised setup forms a clearer L shape with the empty spaces.

The final answer is:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)
