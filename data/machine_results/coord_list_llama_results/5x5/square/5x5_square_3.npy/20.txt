You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only available move is to move left towards the empty space. However, it overlooks the fact that the player can also move up towards another empty space.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the Current Position and Goal
The player is currently at position (4, 3) and needs to reach the goal at position (2, 4).

## Step 2: Analyze Possible Moves from the Current Position
From position (4, 3), the player can move in four possible directions: up, down, left, or right. The player needs to avoid walls and only move through empty spaces.

## Step 3: Determine the Available Moves
The empty spaces are at (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), and (4, 4). The positions directly adjacent to (4, 3) are (4, 2) and (3, 3). However, since (3, 3) is a wall, it is not an option. Besides (4, 2), the other adjacent position is (4, 4), which is available and brings us closer to the goal. Moving up to (3, 3) is not an option because it is a wall, but moving up to (3, 3) and then to (3, 4) or directly to (3, 4) if possible would also be considered.

## Step 4: Choose the Most Appropriate Move
Given the available moves, the most appropriate move to get closer to the goal (2, 4) from the current position (4, 3) is to move up-right to (3, 4) if such a diagonal move is possible. Since it is not possible, We can choose between moving right to (4, 4) or first moving up to (3, 3) and then right to (3, 4) to ultimately reach the goal more efficiently. Because (3, 3) is a wall, We move to (3, 4) is not viable at this moment, and moving right is the correct move.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original solution provided correctly identifies the next move as the only available empty space, which is moving down-right. However, it is said the player is at (3, 4). Let's re-evaluate the positions and the movement to determine the available options.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the Current Position and Goal
The player is currently at position (4, 4) and needs to reach the goal at position (2, 4).

## Step 2: Analyze Possible Moves from the Current Position
From position (4, 4), the player can move in four possible directions: up, down, left, or right. The player needs to avoid walls and only move through empty spaces.

## Step 3: Determine the Available Moves
The empty spaces are at (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), and (4, 3). The positions directly adjacent to (4, 4) are (3, 4) and (4, 3). However, the position directly adjacent to (4, 4) are (4, 3), and moving to (3, 4) brings us considerably closer.

## Step 4: Choose the Most Appropriate Move
Given the available moves, the most appropriate move to get closer to the goal (2, 4) from the current position (4, 4) is to move up to (3, 4).


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the General Shape Formed by the Empty Spaces
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that can be described as an "L" shape or a corner shape, considering the way they connect from (4, 4) and (4, 3) to (2, 3) and then to (2, 2), with an additional arm leading from (3, 2) to (3, 4), slightly disrupting the perfect "L" but still maintaining a corner-like configuration.

## Step 2: Create a New Maze of the Same Size with Empty Spaces Forming the Same Shape
To create a new maze, we will maintain the same size as the original (5x5) and ensure there is a valid path from a new player position (P) to a new goal position (G) through empty spaces that form a similar "L" or corner shape.

## Step 3: Define Walls and Empty Spaces for the New Maze
Let's define the walls and empty spaces for the new maze, ensuring it is not an identical copy of the original but maintains the required shape.

## Step 4: Position the Player and Goal in the New Maze
The player position (P) and goal position (G) will be placed at opposite ends of the "L" shape to ensure a path exists through the empty spaces.

## Step 5: Finalize the New Maze
Given the constraints and objectives, we define the new maze as follows:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

The final answer is:

```
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)
```
