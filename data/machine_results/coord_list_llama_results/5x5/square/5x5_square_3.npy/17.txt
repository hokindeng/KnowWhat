You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll navigate through the maze step by step. 

First, I need to find a path to the goal position from the current player position. The player is at (4, 3), but since (4, 3) is not explicitly listed as an empty space or a wall in the given information, and for the purpose of this exercise, I will proceed under the assumption that it is indeed an empty space or at least a navigable position since the task implies the player starts there.

Given the current position is (4, 3), and the goal is (2, 4), my first move would be to move to the nearest empty space that brings me closer to the goal. 

Since (4, 4) is an empty space and it's directly adjacent to the goal in the vertical direction (but not directly adjacent to the current position, yet relevant for planning), I'll first aim to reach (4, 4) from (4, 3) by moving right. However, the immediate next step from (4, 3) to get closer to the goal is not explicitly defined in the traditional sense, so we'll plan the next move as if seeking to utilize the described empty spaces efficiently towards the goal.

Given the situation, and correcting our aim based on the maze's layout and aiming for (4, 4) directly, since the player is at (4, 3), and there's no direct mention of a wall separating (4, 3) from (4, 4), the most logical move to make, assuming freedom to move into (4, 4), is to go right from (4, 3) to (4, 4).

However, considering the task asks for coordinates of the next move without assuming the ability to move into unspecified spaces as freely as it might have been implied, we should correct the approach by ensuring moves only into explicitly stated empty or goal spaces.

Therefore, given the constraints and corrections in understanding the limits of movement, if we cannot assume (4, 3) is an empty space or treat (4, 4) as immediately reachable for the first move due to strict adherence to the path information, the corrected approach must involve identifying a path utilizing only the explicitly defined empty spaces and adhering strictly to those.

Given this, the explicitly mentioned empty spaces are (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), and (4, 4), with the goal being (2, 4), and the maze layout presents a challenge without clear pathways to immediately propose the exact conventional move without making a few assumptions about implicit path navigability based on the game's logic.

However, with strict adherence to the provided information and aiming for a direct move towards the goal from the current position without venturing into spaces not explicitly marked as empty or assuming immediate accessibility not provided, it becomes clear the puzzle as presented requires identifying the most direct path using only the explicitly empty spaces.

Given these constraints, the immediate solution under strict interpretation appears challenging without additional assumptions about implicit accessibility between current position and explicitly empty spaces or considering the starting position's characteristics that are not fully detailed in the instructions for conventional maze navigation logic application.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 4) and my goal is (2, 4), the next step is to move up to reduce the distance to the goal while staying within the empty spaces. Since I cannot move directly up from (4, 4) without hitting a position not explicitly listed as empty and considering the layout, I should backtrack to find a path that allows me to move towards the goal.

However, given the current position and the available empty spaces, we have to consider the most logical path that adheres to the constraints. The player is at (4, 4), and the next most logical move to reach the goal (2, 4) while considering the constraints of moving through empty spaces is to find a path that connects to (2, 4).

Looking at the available empty spaces, there's a realization that direct vertical movement from (4, 4) to (2, 4) is obstructed by the way the empty spaces are listed, suggesting a reconsideration of the path towards (2, 4).

Given the options, a better consideration is needed to navigate through the provided empty spaces, aiming to get closer to (2, 4). Notably, there's an empty space at (3, 4) that was previously overlooked as an immediate step, which is adjacent to the player's current position.

This realization corrects the approach, indicating the player should move up from (4, 4) to (3, 4), utilizing the explicitly defined empty spaces to navigate closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (3, 4) and my goal is (2, 4), which means I can move directly up from my current position to reach the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 4)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) The general shape is a "staircase" or "L-shape" that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal.

To generate a new maze with the same size and shape, I will create a new set of walls and empty spaces that form a similar staircase or L-shape. Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a similar staircase or L-shape that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a staircase or L-shape.
