You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only viable next position is up, since moving left or down is into a wall and moving right doesn't change the position meaningfully. However, the solution fails to consider the actual maze layout correctly. Given the current player position at (4,3), moving up to (3,3) is incorrect because (3,3) is a wall, not an empty space.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current player position and goal position.
The current player position is given as (4, 3) and the goal position is (2, 4).

## Step 2: Analyze the possible moves from the current position.
Given the current player position at (4, 3), we can potentially move up, down, left, or right. We need to check which of these moves leads to an empty space.

## Step 3: Evaluate the feasible moves based on the maze layout.
Moving left from (4, 3) would lead to (4, 2), which is an empty space. Moving right would not change the position meaningfully towards the goal. Moving up would lead to (3, 3), which is a wall. Moving down isn't considered as it does not bring us closer to the goal in this context.

## Step 4: Choose the best move based on the goal position and avoiding walls.
Considering the need to reach the goal (2, 4) and the layout, the best immediate move from (4, 3) would be to move left to (4, 2), as it's the only adjacent empty space that can potentially lead us closer to the goal without running into a wall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position and goal position.
The current player position is (4, 2) and the goal position is (2, 4).

## Step 2: Analyze the possible moves from the current position.
Given the current player position at (4, 2), we can potentially move up, down, left, or right. We need to check which of these moves leads to an empty space.

## Step 3: Evaluate the feasible moves based on the maze layout.
Moving left from (4, 2) isn't considered because it's towards the wall. Moving right would lead to (4, 3), which is an empty space and a step closer to the goal column. Moving up would lead to (3, 2), an empty space. Moving down isn't considered as there are no empty spaces below the current position that are closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the best move based on the goal position and avoiding walls.
Considering the need to reach the goal (2, 4) and the layout, a better immediate move from (4, 2) would be to move up to (3, 2), as it moves closer to the goal row and provides potential for further movement without immediately facing a wall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  2\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position and goal position.
The current player position is (3, 2) and the goal position is (2, 4).

## Step 2: Analyze the possible moves from the current position.
Given the current player position at (3, 2), we can potentially move up, down, left, or right. We need to check which of these moves leads to an empty space.

## Step 3: Evaluate the feasible moves based on the maze layout.
Moving left isn't considered as it would move away from the goal. Moving right would lead to (3, 3), which is a wall. Moving up would lead to (2, 2), which is an empty space and moves closer to the goal row. Moving down would lead to (4, 2), an empty space but moves away from the goal row.

## Step 4: Choose the best move based on the goal position and avoiding walls.
Considering the need to reach the goal (2, 4) and the layout, the best immediate move from (3, 2) would be to move up to (2, 2), as it moves closer to the goal row and provides potential for further movement towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  2\right)}$

## Step 3: Evaluate the feasible moves based on the maze layout.
Moving left isn't considered as it would move into a wall. Moving up also isn't considered for the same reason. Moving down would lead to (3, 2), an empty space but moves away from the goal. Moving right would lead to (2, 3), which is an empty space and directly moves closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the best move based on the goal position and avoiding walls.
Considering the need to reach the goal (2, 4) and the layout, the best immediate move from (2, 2) would be to move right to (2, 3), as it directly moves closer to the goal without any obstacles.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Based on the layout of the empty spaces, the general shape formed is an "L" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape of empty spaces but in a different configuration.
To create a new maze, we need to rearrange the walls and empty spaces while maintaining the "L" shape of the corridors and ensuring there is a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Define the walls and empty spaces for the new maze.
Given the original maze size is 5x5, we'll keep the same dimensions. We'll place the "L" shaped corridors in a different configuration, ensuring the start (P) and goal (G) are connected through these corridors.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original.
After designing the new maze layout, we encode it by listing the coordinates of the walls, empty spaces, the player position (P), and the goal position (G).

The final answer is: 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 4)
