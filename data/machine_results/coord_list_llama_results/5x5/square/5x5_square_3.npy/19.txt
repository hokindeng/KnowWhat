You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution suggests moving to (4, 2), which, while a valid adjacent empty space, does not consider the overall optimal path to the goal. A better strategy is to move directly towards the goal when possible.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Determine the current player position and the goal position
The current player position is given as (4, 3), and the goal position is given as (2, 4).

## Step 2: Identify the valid movements from the current position
Given the current player position, we can move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent empty space. The valid movements from the current position are moving to (4, 2) or (4, 4).

## Step 3: Evaluate which movement brings us closer to the goal position
The goal position is (2, 4). Moving to (4, 4) brings the player closer to the goal position.

## Step 4: Choose the optimal move
The optimal move is to move to (4, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 4, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Determine the current player position and the goal position
The current player position is given as (4, 4), and the goal position is given as (2, 4).

## Step 2: Identify the valid movements from the current position
Given the current player position, we can move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent empty space. The valid movements from the current position are moving to (3, 4) since it is the only adjacent empty space that brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 3: Evaluate which movement brings us closer to the goal position
The goal position is (2, 4). Moving to (3, 4) is the correct direction towards the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the optimal move
The optimal move is to move to (3, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  4\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Determine the current player position and the goal position
The current player position is given as (3, 4), and the goal position is given as (2, 4).

## Step 2: Identify the valid movements from the current position
Given the current player position, we can move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent empty space. However, since the goal is directly above the current position, moving up is the most logical choice, but since (2, 4) is not currently listed as an empty space, we must recognize it's the goal and aim to move there.

## Step 3: Evaluate which movement brings us closer to the goal position
The goal position is (2, 4). Moving up from (3, 4) to (2, 4) directly reaches the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the optimal move
The optimal move is to move to (2, 4), which is the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  4\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
Upon examining the original maze, the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a reversed "L" or a path that goes around an obstruction to reach the goal. However, considering the movement and the topological layout, it could be best described as forming a path with a distinct "bend" or "elbow" but for simplicity, we can consider it as an "L" shape pathway from a topological perspective.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size that includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces and forms the same general shape
The original maze is 5x5, with coordinates ranging from (0, 0) to (4, 4). We need to create a new maze that fits within this size, has a valid path from P to G, and forms an "L" shape pathway.

## Step 3: Define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal for the new maze
Given the constraints and requirements, here is a possible new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

## Step 4: Verify that the new maze forms the same general shape and is solvable
The empty spaces in the new maze form an "L" shape pathway, allowing the player to move from the player position (1, 1) to the goal position (3, 3) in a manner that resembles the original maze's path shape.

The final answer is:

 Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)
