You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves.

The current player position is (4, 3), and the goal position is (2, 4).

I can move in the up, down, left, or right direction to an adjacent empty space.

Looking at the adjacent spaces, I can move up to (3, 3), but it's a wall. I can move down to (5, 3), but it's outside the maze (not specified, but I'll assume it's not allowed).

I can move left to (4, 2), which is an empty space, or I can move right to (4, 4), which is also an empty space.

Moving left would take me further away from the goal, so I will choose to move right to (4, 4).

My next move is to (4, 4).

Please update the maze and provide the new situation.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll analyze the possible moves again.

The current player position is (4, 4), and the goal position is (2, 4).

Since I'm already at the rightmost column of the maze, I can only move up or down.

Moving down is not an option, as it would take me outside the maze. So, I'll consider moving up.

The space above me is (3, 4), which is an empty space.

I will move up to (3, 4).

My next move is to (3, 4).

Please update the maze and provide the new situation.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll analyze the possible moves again.

The current player position is (3, 4), and the goal position is (2, 4).

Since I'm already at the rightmost column of the maze, I can only move up or down.

Moving down to (4, 4) would take me away from the goal. I'll consider moving up.

The space above me is not available as a wall is not mentioned there in the (2, 4) coordinate but it also is the goal but there are no empty coordinates in (2,4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "staircase".

Here is a new maze with the same size, shape, and characteristics:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but the staircase shape of the empty spaces is still present. The player can navigate from the start position to the goal position by moving up the "staircase".
