You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (3, 2).

Possible moves:
- Moving up to (2, 2) is not possible because it's a wall.
- Moving down to (4, 2) is not possible because it's a wall.
- Moving left to (3, 1) is possible because it's an empty space.
- Moving right to (3, 3) is possible because it's an empty space.

Since the goal position is (0, 2), I will try to move closer to it. Moving left to (3, 1) seems like a good option, as it keeps the player closer to the goal and doesn't block any potential paths.

My next move will be to position (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 1), I'll analyze the possible moves:

Possible moves:
- Moving up to (2, 1) is possible because it's an empty space.
- Moving down to (4, 1) is not possible because it's a wall.
- Moving left to (3, 0) is not possible because it's a wall.
- Moving right to (3, 2) is possible because it's an empty space.

To get closer to the goal position (0, 2), I'll move up to (2, 1), which seems like a good option.

My next move will be to position (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 1), I'll analyze the possible moves:

Possible moves:
- Moving up to (1, 1) is possible because it's an empty space.
- Moving down to (3, 1) is possible because it's an empty space, but it would move away from the goal.
- Moving left to (2, 0) is not possible because it's a wall.
- Moving right to (2, 2) is not possible because it's a wall.

To get closer to the goal position (0, 2), I'll move up to (1, 1), which seems like a good option.

My next move will be to position (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 1), I'll analyze the possible moves:

Possible moves:
- Moving up to (0, 1) is possible because it's an empty space.
- Moving down to (2, 1) is possible because it's an empty space, but it would move away from the goal.
- Moving left to (1, 0) is not possible because it's a wall.
- Moving right to (1, 2) is not possible because it's a wall.

To get closer to the goal position (0, 2), I'll move up to (0, 1), which seems like a good option. This will put me in a position where I'm adjacent to the goal, although not directly next to it.

My next move will be to position (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm so close!

From the current player position (0, 1), I'll analyze the possible moves:

Possible moves:
- Moving up is not possible because I'm already at the top row.
- Moving down to (1, 1) is possible because it's an empty space, but it would move away from the goal.
- Moving left to (0, 0) is not possible because it's a wall.
- Moving right to (0, 2) is the goal position!

I'll move right to the goal position (0, 2).

My next move will be to position (0, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L-shape" or an "elbow shape", since the empty spaces form a roughly L-shaped path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

To create a new maze with the same size and shape, I'll generate a new maze that meets the criteria. Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)
