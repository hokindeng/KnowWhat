You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Based on the given maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the current player position (3, 2).

Possible moves:
- Moving up to (2, 2) is not possible because it's a wall.
- Moving down to (4, 2) is not possible because it's a wall.
- Moving left to (3, 1) is possible because it's an empty space.
- Moving right to (3, 3) is possible because it's an empty space.

Since the goal position is (0, 2), I will try to move closer to it. Moving left to (3, 1) seems like a good option, as it keeps the player closer to the goal and doesn't block any potential paths.

My next move will be to position (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 1), I'll analyze the possible moves:

Possible moves:
- Moving up to (2, 1) is possible because it's an empty space.
- Moving down to (4, 1) is not possible because it's a wall.
- Moving left to (2, 0) is not possible because it's a wall, and even if I move to (2, 0) if it was possible I will still have the wall (1, 0) to the left of (2, 0).
- Moving right to (3, 2) is possible because it's an empty space.

Since the goal position is (0, 2), I will try to move closer to it. Moving up to (2, 1) seems like a good option, as it keeps the player closer to the goal and doesn't block any potential paths.

My next move will be to position (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 1), I'll analyze the possible moves:

Possible moves:
- Moving up to (1, 1) is possible because it's an empty space.
- Moving down to (3, 1) is possible because it's an empty space, but it would move me further away from the goal.
- Moving left to (2, 0) is not possible because it's a wall.
- Moving right to (2, 2) is not possible because it's a wall.

Since the goal position is (0, 2), I will try to move closer to it. Moving up to (1, 1) seems like a good option, as it keeps the player closer to the goal and doesn't block any potential paths.

My next move will be to position (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 1), I'll analyze the possible moves:

Possible moves:
- Moving up to (0, 1) is possible because it's an empty space.
- Moving down to (2, 1) is possible because it's an empty space, but it would move me further away from the goal.
- Moving left to (1, 0) is not possible because it's a wall.
- Moving right to (1, 2) is not possible because it's a wall.

Since the goal position is (0, 2), I will try to move closer to it. Moving up to (0, 1) seems like a good option, as it keeps the player closer to the goal and doesn't block any potential paths.

However, I notice that the goal position (0, 2) is to the right of (0, 1). Since I'm moving to (0, 1) now, I should plan ahead to move right to (0, 2) in the next step.

My next move will be to position (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 1), I can see that the goal position (0, 2) is directly to the right of me.

Possible moves:
- Moving up to (-1, 1) is not possible because it's outside the maze boundaries.
- Moving down to (1, 1) is possible because it's an empty space, but it would move me further away from the goal.
- Moving left to (0, 0) is not possible because it's a wall.
- Moving right to (0, 2) is possible because it's the goal position.

My next move will be to position (0, 2), which is the goal. I have reached the end of the maze!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a "corner shape" with a long vertical segment connected to a horizontal segment.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original and features a path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, which forms an L-shape. It is not an identical copy of the original maze, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape.
