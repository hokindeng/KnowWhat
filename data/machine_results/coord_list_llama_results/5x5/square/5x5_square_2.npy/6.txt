You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since I'm currently at position (3, 2), I'll examine the adjacent empty spaces.

The available moves from (3, 2) are:

* Up: (2, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move up.
* Down: (4, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
* Left: (3, 1) is an empty space, so I can move left.
* Right: (3, 3) is an empty space, so I can move right.

Considering the goal position (0, 2) is to the left and up from my current position, I'll choose to move left to (3, 1). This move brings me closer to the goal and gives me more options for the next move.

My next move is to (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (3, 1), I'll analyze the adjacent empty spaces:

* Up: (2, 1) is an empty space, so I can move up.
* Down: (4, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
* Left: There is no space to the left of (3, 1), as (3, 0) is a wall and (2, 0) is also a wall. I need to move up to create more opportunities.
* Right: (3, 2) is an empty space, but I just came from there, and moving right doesn't bring me closer to the goal.

Since my goal is to move towards the goal position (0, 2), I'll choose to move up to (2, 1). This move opens up more possibilities and brings me closer to the goal.

My next move is to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (2, 1), I'll examine the adjacent empty spaces:

* Up: (1, 1) is an empty space, so I can move up.
* Down: (3, 1) is an empty space, but I just came from there. Moving down would take me away from the goal.
* Left: (2, 0) is a wall, so I cannot move left.
* Right: (2, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move right.

Considering my goal position (0, 2) is to the left and up from my current position, I'll choose to move up to (1, 1). This move brings me closer to the goal and gives me more options for the next move.

My next move is to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (1, 1), I'll examine the adjacent empty spaces:

* Up: I'm near the top of the maze, but (0, 1) is an empty space, so I can move up.
* Down: (2, 1) is an empty space, but moving down would take me away from the goal.
* Left: (1, 0) is a wall, so I cannot move left.
* Right: (1, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move right.

Considering my goal position (0, 2) is to the left and up from my current position, I'll choose to move up to (0, 1). This move brings me closer to the goal and gives me a potential opportunity to find a path to the goal.

My next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (0, 1), I'll analyze the situation:

* I'm directly below the goal (0, 2), but it's not an available empty space because (0, 2) wasn't explicitly listed as an empty space in the updated maze. However, since the goal is there, it's likely that I can move up.

Since I'm adjacent to the goal position and I can move up, I'll choose to move up to (0, 2).

My next move is to (0, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a "corner shape," where the empty spaces form an L-like path around the walls.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form an L-shape or corner shape, allowing the player to navigate from the starting position to the goal through the corridors. The maze has the same size as the original and is not an identical copy.
