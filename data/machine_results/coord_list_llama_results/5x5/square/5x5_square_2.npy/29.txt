You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
First, visualize the maze layout based on the provided coordinates for walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position. The walls are at coordinates (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4). The empty spaces are at (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4). The player is currently at (3, 2), and the goal is at (0, 2).

## Step 2: Determine the initial possible moves
Given the player's current position (3, 2), identify the adjacent empty spaces that are not blocked by walls. The player can move up, down, left, or right. The possible moves from (3, 2) are to (3, 1), (3, 3), (2, 2), or (4, 2). However, (2, 2) and (4, 2) are walls, so they are not valid moves.

## Step 3: Evaluate the moves towards the goal
Considering the valid moves (3, 1) and (3, 3), evaluate which move brings the player closer to the goal (0, 2) or sets up a future move towards the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the best initial move
Given the layout, moving to (3, 3) seems less optimal initially because it moves away from the goal's x-coordinate. Moving to (3, 1) might seem more promising because it keeps the option open to move towards the goal's x-coordinate without increasing the distance in the y-direction. However, we should also consider the subsequent moves and how they allow us to navigate towards the goal.

## Step 5: Plan subsequent moves
Considering future moves from (3, 1), one possible path involves moving left when possible to decrease the x-coordinate to reach the goal's x-coordinate. Given the maze's structure, moving from (3, 1) to (2, 1) would be the next logical step after reaching (3, 1), because it reduces the distance to the goal's x-coordinate and keeps options open for further movement.

## Step 6: Finalize the initial move based on the overall strategy
Based on the analysis, the initial move that seems to lead towards the goal most effectively is to move to (3, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Review the updated maze and current position
After the last move, the player is at (3, 1). The goal remains at (0, 2).

## Step 2: Determine possible moves from the current position
Given the player's position at (3, 1), the possible moves are to (3, 0), (3, 2), (2, 1), or (4, 1). However, (3, 0) and (4, 1) are walls, so they are not valid moves.

## Step 3: Evaluate the moves towards the goal
Considering the valid moves (3, 2) and (2, 1), evaluate which move brings the player closer to the goal (0, 2) or sets up a future move towards the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the best move
Moving to (3, 2) moves away from the x-coordinate of the goal, while moving to (2, 1) reduces the distance to the goal's x-coordinate. Therefore, the best move is to (2, 1).

## Step 5: Confirm the choice aligns with the overall strategy
Moving to (2, 1) aligns with the overall strategy of reducing the x-coordinate distance to the goal when possible, without increasing the y-coordinate distance unnecessarily.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Review the updated maze and current position
After the last move, the player is at (2, 1). The goal remains at (0, 2).

## Step 2: Determine possible moves from the current position
Given the player's position at (2, 1), the possible moves are to (2, 0), (2, 2), (1, 1), or (3, 1). However, (2, 0) and (2, 2) are walls, so they are not valid moves.

## Step 3: Evaluate the moves towards the goal
Considering the valid moves (1, 1) and (3, 1), evaluate which move brings the player closer to the goal (0, 2) or sets up a future move towards the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the best move
Moving to (3, 1) moves away from the x-coordinate of the goal, while moving to (1, 1) reduces the distance to the goal's x-coordinate. Therefore, the best move is to (1, 1).

## Step 5: Consider the y-coordinate move
Given that moving directly to the goal's x-coordinate (0, x) will involve moving up to y-coordinate 2 at some point, consider that (1, 1) allows for a potential move up in the future.

## Step 6: Confirm the choice aligns with the overall strategy
Moving to (1, 1) aligns with the overall strategy of reducing the x-coordinate distance to the goal when possible, without increasing the y-coordinate distance unnecessarily, and sets up future moves towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Review the updated maze and current position
After the last move, the player is at (1, 1). The goal remains at (0, 2).

## Step 2: Determine possible moves from the current position
Given the player's position at (1, 1), the possible moves are to (1, 0), (1, 2), (0, 1), or (2, 1). However, (1, 0) and (1, 2) are walls, so they are not valid moves.

## Step 3: Evaluate the moves towards the goal
Considering the valid moves (0, 1) and (2, 1), evaluate which move brings the player closer to the goal (0, 2) or sets up a future move towards the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the best move
Moving to (2, 1) moves away from the goal's x-coordinate, while moving to (0, 1) reduces the distance to the goal's x-coordinate and aligns the player with a potential path to move up towards the goal's y-coordinate. Therefore, the best move is to (0, 1).

## Step 5: Confirm the choice allows for y-coordinate adjustment
Moving to (0, 1) allows the player to potentially move up to (0, 2) in the next step, directly reaching the goal.

## Step 6: Confirm the choice aligns with the overall strategy
Moving to (0, 1) aligns with the overall strategy of reducing the distance to the goal when possible and sets up the potential for reaching the goal in the next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Review the updated maze and current position
After the last move, the player is at (0, 1). The goal remains at (0, 2).

## Step 2: Determine possible moves from the current position
Given the player's position at (0, 1), the possible moves are to (0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 1), or (-1, 1) (if it existed within the maze boundaries). However, (0, 0) is a wall and (-1, 1) is outside the maze, so they are not valid moves.

## Step 3: Evaluate the moves towards the goal
Considering the valid moves (0, 2) and (1, 1), evaluate which move brings the player closer to the goal (0, 2).

## Step 4: Choose the best move
Moving to (1, 1) would move away from the goal, while moving to (0, 2) would directly reach the goal. Therefore, the best move is to (0, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
Based on the original maze, the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a serpent or snake-like path from the player's starting position to the goal.

## Step 2: Determine the name of the general shape
The general shape can be described as a "serpentine" or "winding" path.

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same size as the original
The original maze has a size of 5x5.

## Step 4: Design a new maze with a serpentine path
Create a new maze with a serpentine path from the player's starting position to the goal. Ensure the maze is not an identical copy of the original.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original
The new maze should have the same format as the original, with coordinates for walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position.

New Maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (0, 3)

Note: This new maze is not an identical copy of the original but maintains a serpentine path from the player's starting position to the goal.

The final answer is: There is no specific numerical answer to this problem as it requires creating a new maze with specific properties.
