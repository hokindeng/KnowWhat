You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move. 

To reach the goal position (0, 2), I need to move left and up from the current player position (3, 2). However, since the current position is not an empty space in the original list, I have to find the nearest empty space that will allow me to move closer to the goal.

Looking at the empty spaces, I can move to (3, 1) which is adjacent to my current position. This move will allow me to start moving left and up towards the goal.

My next move is: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

My current position is (3, 1). To get closer to the goal position (0, 2), I need to move left and up. 

There is an empty space at (2, 1) that is directly left of my current position, allowing me to move closer to the goal. 

My next move is: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

My current position is (2, 1). To get closer to the goal position (0, 2), I need to move left. 

There is an empty space at (1, 1) that is directly left of my current position, allowing me to move closer to the goal.

My next move is: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

My current position is (1, 1). To get closer to the goal position (0, 2), I need to move left.

There is an empty space at (0, 1) that is directly left of my current position, allowing me to move closer to the goal.

My next move is: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

My current position is (0, 1), and my goal is (0, 2), which is just above my current position. However, I notice that (0, 2) is not in the list of empty spaces, but it's not a wall either. Since it's my goal position, I'll assume it's a valid space.

My next move is: (0, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or an "L-path" with some additional connecting corridors.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and has an L-shape with some additional connecting corridors. It is not an identical copy of the original maze.
