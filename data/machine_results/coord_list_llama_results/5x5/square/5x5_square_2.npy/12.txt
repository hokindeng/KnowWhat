You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout
First, visualize the maze layout based on the provided coordinates for walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position. The walls are at coordinates (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4). The empty spaces are at (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4). The player is currently at (3, 2), and the goal is at (0, 2).

## Step 2: Determine the current player position and goal
Identify that the current player position (P) is at (3, 2) and the goal (G) is at (0, 2).

## Step 3: Evaluate possible moves from the current position
Given the current position (3, 2), evaluate possible moves to adjacent empty spaces. The player can move up, down, left, or right. However, based on the maze layout, the only viable moves are to move left to (3, 1) or move up is blocked by a wall, down is also not an option because there is a wall at (4, 2) and right to (3, 3).

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal is to reach (0, 2), the best next move would be to move to a position that brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls and staying on the path of empty spaces. Among the possible moves, moving left to (3, 1) is a logical step as it allows further movement towards the goal in subsequent turns.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
First, visualize the updated maze layout based on the provided coordinates for walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position after the last move.

## Step 2: Determine the current player position and goal
Identify that the current player position (P) is at (3, 1) and the goal (G) is at (0, 2).

## Step 3: Evaluate possible moves from the current position
Given the current position (3, 1), evaluate possible moves to adjacent empty spaces. The player can move up, down, left, or right. Based on the maze layout, the viable moves are to move up to (2, 1) or move right to (3, 2).

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal is to reach (0, 2), the best next move would be to move to a position that brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls and staying on the path of empty spaces. Among the possible moves, moving up to (2, 1) is a logical step as it allows further movement towards the goal in subsequent turns and reduces the distance to the goal more effectively than moving right.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
First, visualize the updated maze layout based on the provided coordinates for walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position after the last move.

## Step 2: Determine the current player position and goal
Identify that the current player position (P) is at (2, 1) and the goal (G) is at (0, 2).

## Step 3: Evaluate possible moves from the current position
Given the current position (2, 1), evaluate possible moves to adjacent empty spaces. The player can move up, down, left, or right. Based on the maze layout, the viable moves are to move left to (1, 1) or move right which is not an option due to the presence of a wall at (2, 2) and also moving down to (3, 1).

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal is to reach (0, 2), the best next move would be to move to a position that brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls and staying on the path of empty spaces. Among the possible moves, moving left to (1, 1) is a logical step as it allows further movement towards the goal in subsequent turns and reduces the distance to the goal more effectively than moving down.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
First, visualize the updated maze layout based on the provided coordinates for walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position after the last move.

## Step 2: Determine the current player position and goal
Identify that the current player position (P) is at (1, 1) and the goal (G) is at (0, 2).

## Step 3: Evaluate possible moves from the current position
Given the current position (1, 1), evaluate possible moves to adjacent empty spaces. The player can move up, down, left, or right. Based on the maze layout, the only viable move is to move left to (0, 1) since moving up is blocked by a wall at (1, 0), moving right is blocked by a wall at (1, 2), and moving down is not towards the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal is to reach (0, 2), moving left to (0, 1) gets us closer to the goal column and from there we might find a way to move up or down to the goal. Thus, it's the best available move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the updated maze layout
First, visualize the updated maze layout based on the provided coordinates for walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position after the last move.

## Step 2: Determine the current player position and goal
Identify that the current player position (P) is at (0, 1) and the goal (G) is at (0, 2).

## Step 3: Evaluate possible moves from the current position
Given the current position (0, 1), evaluate possible moves to adjacent empty spaces. The player can move up, down, left, or right. However, moving left is not an option since it would put the player outside the maze, and moving up is blocked by a wall at (0, 0).

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal is to reach (0, 2), the only viable move is to move down, but since we are at the correct column, we actually need to move right to (0, 2) directly which is our goal, or so it would seem. However, (0, 2) is not listed as an empty space. The next best option is to move down to (0, 3) hoping that will provide a pathway to the goal or closer to it, but we actually need to consider (0, 2) as blocked by the description given. Thus moving down is our only available move.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  3\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
After analyzing the original maze, it appears that the general shape formed by the empty spaces is a serpentine or winding path.

## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to generate a serpentine or winding path within the 5x5 maze that allows a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position of the new maze
Let's define the new maze as follows:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (1, 3), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 3)

The final answer is: 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (1, 3), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 3)
