You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. 

Considering the current player position is (3, 2), the goal is to reach (0, 2), and we can only move to adjacent empty spaces.

Available adjacent empty spaces are (3, 1) and (3, 3). Moving to (3, 1) doesn't get us closer to the goal, but moving to (3, 3) is a step in the right direction. From (3, 3), we can potentially move further towards the goal.

So, my next move would be to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Considering the current player position is (3, 3), and the goal is to reach (0, 2), I'll analyze the available options.

Available adjacent empty spaces are (3, 2) and (3, 4). Moving to (3, 2) would backtrack, but moving to (3, 4) could potentially create an opportunity to move further towards the goal.

However, there's another possibility. Since the goal is at (0, 2) and there's an empty space at (3, 2), I'll try to find an alternative route. I notice that the space (2, 1) is empty, and from there, I might be able to find a way to move closer to the goal.

But for now, I'll try to get closer to (2, 1) by moving to (3, 2) is not optimal, so I will move to (3, 4) could be an option but instead I will move to  (3, 2) is not optimal. However I notice 3, 2  then 2,1 and finally the 1,1 so 

So I will try get one step back. Then I will go to (3, 2).



 and analyze

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (3, 2). As planned, my next move is to (2, 1) is not adjacent. I must go to an adjacent one to (2,1),  so 

To go to (2,1) I will have to move first adjacent (3,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (3, 1). My next planned move is to (2, 1). This will bring me closer to the goal.

So, my next move is to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (2, 1). The goal (0, 2) is within reach if I move in the right direction.

However, I notice that I'm blocked by a wall at (1, 2) and (2, 2), and there's a gap at (1, 1) which is adjacent to my current position. 

My next move is to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (1, 1). To get to the goal (0, 2), I need to move left. Since (0, 1) is empty and adjacent to my current position, my next move is to (0, 1). This will bring me one step closer to the goal.

Then, I can potentially move up to (0, 2) if it's possible.

So, my next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (0, 1). My goal (0, 2) is one step up from here.

However, the problem states that I can only move to empty spaces, and it seems that (0, 2) is not explicitly listed as an empty space. The reason for this is that it was not explicitly stated that the goal (0, 2) is also an empty space, however in most mazes the goal is implicitly also an empty space since we are trying to reach it.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag staircase" or a " winding stair".

Here is a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)


This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and has empty spaces that form a winding stair shape. Note that this is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it has a similar overall structure.
