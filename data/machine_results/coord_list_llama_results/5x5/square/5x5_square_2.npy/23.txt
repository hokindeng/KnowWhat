You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only viable next position is directly left (3, 1), overlooking the possibility of moving in other directions that might be available after a thorough evaluation of the maze structure and the rules provided.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the maze structure
The maze has specific coordinates for walls, empty spaces, the current player position, and the goal position. The player can move up, down, left, or right to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 2: Determine the player's possible moves
Given the player's position at (3, 2), we need to look at the coordinates provided for empty spaces to see where the player can move. The player can only move to an empty space adjacent to their current position.

## Step 3: Evaluate adjacent positions
Looking at the empty spaces provided: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), the adjacent empty space to (3, 2) in the up direction is blocked by walls, in the down direction is not directly available, but in the left direction is (3, 1), and in the right direction is (3, 3).

## Step 4: Prioritize the movement towards the goal
Given the goal position is (0, 2), and considering the structure of the maze and the objective to move closer to the goal, the player should prioritize moving in the direction that aligns with reaching the goal most efficiently. Since moving directly up is blocked, the next best option is to move to an empty space that would eventually allow for the most direct path to the goal, which is moving up when given the chance. However, given the immediate options and the structure of the maze, the correct approach involves evaluating which of the available moves sets up a future move closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Execute the move
Considering the options, moving left to (3, 1) sets up a potential future path up through (2, 1) which could lead closer to the goal, making this a viable next step.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation

The original solution was to provide the next move's coordinates without explaining the steps taken to determine that move. Given the corrected format, I'll provide the complete reasoning for the next move based on the updated maze state.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the updated maze structure
The maze's state has changed with the player now at (2, 1). The goal remains at (0, 2), and the available empty spaces and walls are updated accordingly.

## Step 2: Determine the player's possible moves
Given the player's new position at (2, 1), we look at the adjacent empty spaces. The player can move up, down, left, or right to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Evaluate adjacent positions
Considering the empty spaces: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), the adjacent empty space to (2, 1) in the up direction is not directly available due to walls, but in the left direction, (1, 1) is a viable option.

## Step 4: Prioritize the movement towards the goal
Given the goal position (0, 2), moving left to (1, 1) brings the player closer to the goal by opening up a potential path upwards in the future.

## Step 5: Execute the move
Considering the options and the need to move closer to the goal, moving left to (1, 1) is the best next step.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

## Step 4: Prioritize the movement towards the goal
Given the goal position (0, 2), moving left to (0, 1) brings the player closer to the goal by being in the same column as the goal, allowing for potential movement up in the future if direct movement to the goal is not immediately available.

## Step 5: Execute the move
Considering the options and the need to move closer to the goal, moving left to (0, 1) is the best next step.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

However, in the context of the maze and the game, the goal is considered an achievable destination if directly adjacent.

## Step 4: Prioritize the movement towards the goal
Given the goal position (0, 2), and considering the maze's nature, moving directly to the goal if adjacent is the priority. Since the goal is directly above the player's current position and there's no wall in between as per the given structure, moving up to (0, 2) is the best next step.

## Step 5: Execute the move
Considering the direct adjacency and the objective, moving up to (0, 2) achieves the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Upon reviewing the original maze, the empty spaces seem to form a path that roughly resembles an "L" shape with extensions, connecting the start and goal positions. However, given the complexity and the additional paths, it might be more accurately described as having a shape that facilitates a path from start to goal with a couple of turns, resembling a more complex or irregular path than a simple geometric shape like an "L". For simplicity, we might generalize this as an irregular path that includes turns, most closely related to an "L" shape due to its significant turn from the starting point to the goal.

## Step 2: Design a new maze of the same size that includes a valid path from P to G, ensuring the maze is not an identical copy of the original and the general shape formed by its empty spaces resembles the identified shape.
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we'll design it so that it also forms an irregular path with turns but ensures a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G). Given the size and requirements, the new maze must have a similar "L"-like irregular path with necessary adjustments to not copy the original.

## New Maze Description:
- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)
- Player position: (3, 1)
- Goal: (0, 4)

This maze maintains the same size as the original, is not an identical copy, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and the general shape formed by its corridors is recognizable as an irregular "L"-like path with necessary turns to reach the goal from the starting position.

The final answer is not provided as the problem requires descriptive answers about maze shapes and generating a new maze, rather than solving for a numerical value.
