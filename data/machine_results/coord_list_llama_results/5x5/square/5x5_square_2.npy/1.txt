You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the next step should always be an empty space that is closest to the goal. However, this is a greedy approach that does not guarantee the shortest path to the goal. In a maze, it's possible that moving further away from the goal initially can lead to a shorter path overall.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Determine the possible moves from the current player position.
The current player position is at (3, 2). To find the possible moves, we need to check the adjacent positions (up, down, left, right) and see if they are empty spaces. The adjacent positions are (3, 1), (3, 3), (2, 2), and (4, 2). We can see that (3, 1) and (3, 3) are empty spaces, but (2, 2) is a wall and (4, 2) is also a wall.

## Step 2: Find a path to the goal using a pathfinding algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS).
To find the shortest path, we will use BFS. We start by adding the current player position (3, 2) to a queue. Then, we explore each adjacent position that is an empty space and add them to the queue.

## Step 3: Continue the BFS until the goal position (0, 2) is reached.
After exploring the maze using BFS, we find that one possible path to the goal is (3, 2) -> (3, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2) is not possible because (1, 2) is a wall -> (1, 1) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2).

## Step 4: Determine the next move based on the path found.
Based on the path found, the next move should be to position (3, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Determine the possible moves from the current player position.
The current player position is at (3, 1). To find the possible moves, we need to check the adjacent positions (up, down, left, right) and see if they are empty spaces. The adjacent positions are (3, 0), (3, 2), (2, 1), and (4, 1). We can see that (3, 2) and (2, 1) are empty spaces, but (3, 0) is a wall and (4, 1) is also a wall.

## Step 2: Continue the pathfinding process using BFS.
We will continue the BFS from the previous step. Since we are at (3, 1), we can move to (2, 1).

## Step 3: Continue the BFS until the goal position (0, 2) is reached.
After moving to (2, 1), we will explore the adjacent positions. We can see that we can move to (1, 1).

## Step 4: Determine the next move based on the path found.
Based on the path found, the next move should be to position (2, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Determine the possible moves from the current player position.
The current player position is at (2, 1). To find the possible moves, we need to check the adjacent positions (up, down, left, right) and see if they are empty spaces. The adjacent positions are (2, 0), (2, 2), (1, 1), and (3, 1). We can see that (1, 1) and (3, 1) are empty spaces, but (2, 0) is a wall and (2, 2) is also a wall.

## Step 2: Continue the pathfinding process using BFS.
We will continue the BFS from the previous step. Since we are at (2, 1), we can move to (1, 1).

## Step 3: Continue the BFS until the goal position (0, 2) is reached.
After moving to (1, 1), we will explore the adjacent positions. We can see that we can move to (0, 1) or (1, 0) is not possible because (1, 0) is a wall.

## Step 4: Determine the next move based on the path found.
Based on the path found, the next move should be to position (1, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Determine the possible moves from the current player position.
The current player position is at (1, 1). To find the possible moves, we need to check the adjacent positions (up, down, left, right) and see if they are empty spaces. The adjacent positions are (1, 0), (1, 2), (0, 1), and (2, 1). We can see that (0, 1) and (2, 1) are empty spaces, but (1, 0) is a wall and (1, 2) is also a wall.

## Step 2: Continue the pathfinding process using BFS.
We will continue the BFS from the previous step. Since we are at (1, 1), we can move to (0, 1).

## Step 3: Continue the BFS until the goal position (0, 2) is reached.
After moving to (0, 1), we will explore the adjacent positions. We can see that we can move to (0, 2) which is the goal position.

## Step 4: Determine the next move based on the path found.
Based on the path found, the next move should be to position (0, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Determine the possible moves from the current player position.
The current player position is at (0, 1). To find the possible moves, we need to check the adjacent positions (up, down, left, right) and see if they are empty spaces or the goal. The adjacent positions are (0, 0), (0, 2), (-1, 1), and (1, 1). We can see that (0, 2) is the goal and (1, 1) is an empty space, but (0, 0) is a wall and (-1, 1) is out of the maze.

## Step 2: Move to the goal position.
Since the goal position is adjacent to the current player position, we can move directly to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "zigzag" or a "winding path" that connects the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

This new maze meets the criteria of having the same size as the original, including a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and forming a similar zigzag shape with its empty spaces. It is not an identical copy of the original maze.
