You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move. 

To reach the goal position (0, 2), I need to move from my current position (3, 2) towards the goal. However, since (2, 2) is a wall, I'll have to avoid it. 

My possible moves are to go up, down, left, or right. Moving up or down doesn't help me, and moving right would put me further away from the goal. The best option is to move left to (3, 1), which is an empty space.

My next move is to (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

I'm currently at (3, 1). To move closer to the goal (0, 2), I'll try to move up to (2, 1), which is an empty space. This move brings me closer to the goal and avoids any walls.

My next move is to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

I'm currently at (2, 1). To move closer to the goal (0, 2), I'll try to move up to (1, 1), which is an empty space. This move brings me closer to the goal and avoids any walls.

My next move is to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

I'm currently at (1, 1). To move closer to the goal (0, 2), I'll try to move up and left to (0, 1), which is an empty space. However, since (1, 2) is a wall, I won't be able to move directly to the goal from (0, 1). Instead, I'll move to (0, 1) first and then reassess my next move.

My next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

Unfortunately, since (0, 2) is the goal and (1, 2) is a wall, and there is no empty space at (0, 2) above or below my current position to allow a detour, and I am directly below it, I am forced to say my goal is blocked by a wall.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) "U-shaped" or "Crescent-shaped"

The empty spaces form a curved, U-like shape that connects the player position to the goal.

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is also recognizable as a U-shape or crescent shape. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original.
