You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. 

Considering the current player position is (3, 2), the goal is to reach (0, 2), and we can only move to adjacent empty spaces.

Available adjacent empty spaces are (3, 1) and (3, 3). Moving to (3, 1) doesn't get us closer to the goal, but moving to (3, 3) is a step in the right direction. From (3, 3), we can potentially move further towards the goal.

So, my next move would be to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Considering the current player position is (3, 3), and the goal is to reach (0, 2), I'll analyze the available options.

Available adjacent empty spaces are (3, 2) and (3, 4). Moving to (3, 2) would mean going back to the previous position, which doesn't help. However, moving to (3, 4) allows us to potentially move around the wall and get closer to the goal from the other side.

So, my next move would be to (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the current player position at (3, 4), the goal is still to reach (0, 2). 

Available adjacent empty spaces are (2, 4). Moving to (2, 4) would get us closer to the goal and potentially allow us to move around the wall.

So, my next move would be to (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Considering the current player position at (2, 4), I'll analyze the available options.

Available adjacent empty spaces are (1, 4). Moving to (1, 4) would get us closer to the goal and potentially allow us to move around the wall.

So, my next move would be to (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Considering the current player position at (1, 4), and the goal is to reach (0, 2). 

Available adjacent empty spaces are (1, 1) and (0, 4). Moving to (1, 1) doesn't seem to help, as the wall at (1, 2) blocks the path to the goal. However, moving to (0, 4) gets us closer to the goal column and allows us to potentially move towards the goal.

So, my next move would be to (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're getting close!

Considering the current player position at (0, 4), and the goal is to reach (0, 2).

Available adjacent empty spaces are (0, 3). Moving to (0, 3) gets us closer to the goal, which is just one step away.

So, my next move would be to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The final step!

Considering the current player position at (0, 3), and the goal is to reach (0, 2), which is just one step away.

Available adjacent empty spaces are not explicitly listed, but since the goal (0, 2) is not a wall and was previously mentioned as part of the maze, I'll assume it's a valid move.

So, my next move would be to (0, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors)**

The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the maze is an "L-shape".

**2. A new maze with the same size and shape**

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original (5x5) and forms an "L-shape" with its empty spaces. The maze is not identical to the original, and there is a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G) through the empty spaces.
