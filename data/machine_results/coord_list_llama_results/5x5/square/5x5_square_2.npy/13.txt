You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. Since we're at position (3, 2), we'll examine the adjacent coordinates.

* Up: (2, 2) is a wall, so we cannot move up.
* Down: (4, 2) is also a wall, so we cannot move down.
* Left: (3, 1) is an empty space, so we can move left.
* Right: (3, 3) is also an empty space, so we can move right.

Considering the goal position is (0, 2), which is to our left and up, it would be more efficient to move left first. Therefore, our next move will be to position (3, 1).

The coordinates of our next move are (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze again. Since we're now at position (3, 1), we'll examine the adjacent coordinates.

* Up: (2, 1) is an empty space, so we can move up.
* Down: (4, 1) is a wall, so we cannot move down.
* Left: (3, 0) is a wall, so we cannot move left.
* Right: (3, 2) is an empty space, so we can move right.

Considering the goal position is (0, 2), which is to our up and left, it would be more efficient to move up first. Therefore, our next move will be to position (2, 1).

The coordinates of our next move are (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze again. Since we're now at position (2, 1), we'll examine the adjacent coordinates.

* Up: (1, 1) is an empty space, so we can move up.
* Down: (3, 1) is an empty space, but we've already come from there, so we won't move down.
* Left: (2, 0) is a wall, so we cannot move left.
* Right: (2, 2) is a wall, so we cannot move right.

Since the goal position is (0, 2), and we can move up to (1, 1), we'll move up to get closer to the goal. Our next move will be to position (1, 1).

The coordinates of our next move are (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze again. Since we're now at position (1, 1), we'll examine the adjacent coordinates.

* Up: (0, 1) is an empty space, so we can move up.
* Down: (2, 1) is an empty space, but we've already come from there, so we won't move down.
* Left: (1, 0) is a wall, so we cannot move left.
* Right: (1, 2) is a wall, so we cannot move right.

Since the goal position is (0, 2), and we can move up to (0, 1), we'll move up to get closer to the goal. Our next move will be to position (0, 1).

The coordinates of our next move are (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're close to the goal!

Since we're at position (0, 1), we can see that the goal position (0, 2) is just to the right of us. However, we need to verify if we can move right.

* Up: (not applicable, already at the top row)
* Down: (1, 1) is an empty space, but we've already come from there, so we won't move down.
* Left: (0, 0) is a wall, so we cannot move left.
* Right: (0, 2) is the goal, and it's not marked as a wall, so we can move right.

Our next move will be to the goal position (0, 2).

The coordinates of our next move are (0, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as an "L-shape" or a " corner shape", but more specifically, a " staircase shape" would be a more fitting description.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through the empty spaces. The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a staircase shape, similar to the original maze. Note that this is not an identical copy of the original maze, but rather a new maze with a similar shape.
