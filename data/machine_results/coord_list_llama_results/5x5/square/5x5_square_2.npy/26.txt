You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the next best move from the player's position (3, 2) is to move up to (2, 2), but this is actually a wall. A correct approach would be to identify the empty spaces near the player's position and move accordingly.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current player position and goal position.
The player's current position is at coordinates (3, 2) and the goal position is at coordinates (0, 2).

## Step 2: Examine the immediate surroundings of the player's position.
Looking at the coordinates around (3, 2), we can identify the empty spaces and walls. The empty spaces near the player are at coordinates (3, 1) and (3, 3).

## Step 3: Determine the next move.
To move towards the goal position (0, 2) from the player's position (3, 2), we can move left to (3, 1) or right to (3, 3), but moving left to (3, 1) is more efficient.

## Step 4: Choose the direction of the next move.
Since moving left brings us closer to the left edge, where the goal is located, and keeps us away from the cluster of walls, we should move left.

## Step 5: State the coordinates of the next move.
Based on the decision to move left, the coordinates of the next move will be (3, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original solution process from the previous response is sound and works for the updated maze state as well, so it will be applied again without significant modification.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Identify the current player position and goal position.
The player's current position is at coordinates (3, 1) and the goal position is at coordinates (0, 2).

## Step 2: Examine the immediate surroundings of the player's position.
Looking at the coordinates around (3, 1), we can identify the empty spaces and walls. The empty spaces near the player are at coordinates (3, 2) and (2, 1).

## Step 3: Determine the next move.
To move towards the goal position (0, 2) from the player's position (3, 1), we can move right to (3, 2) or up to (2, 1), but moving up to (2, 1) is more efficient.

## Step 4: Choose the direction of the next move.
Since moving up brings us closer to the top edge, where the goal is located, we should move up.

## Step 5: State the coordinates of the next move.
Based on the decision to move up, the coordinates of the next move will be (2, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position and goal position.
The player's current position is at coordinates (2, 1) and the goal position is at coordinates (0, 2).

## Step 2: Examine the immediate surroundings of the player's position.
Looking at the coordinates around (2, 1), we can identify the empty spaces and walls. The empty space near the player is at coordinate (1, 1).

## Step 3: Determine the next move.
To move towards the goal position (0, 2) from the player's position (2, 1), we can move left to (1, 1).

## Step 4: Choose the direction of the next move.
Since moving left brings us closer to the left edge, where the goal is located, we should move left.

## Step 5: State the coordinates of the next move.
Based on the decision to move left, the coordinates of the next move will be (1, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position and goal position.
The player's current position is at coordinates (1, 1) and the goal position is at coordinates (0, 2).

## Step 2: Examine the immediate surroundings of the player's position.
Looking at the coordinates around (1, 1), we can identify the empty spaces and walls. The empty space near the player that is closest to the goal is not directly accessible because of a wall at (1, 2), but we can move to (1, 4) or back to (2, 1), however, these moves do not bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 3: Re-evaluate the next move.
Since we are stuck because of the wall at (1, 2), we should look for an alternative path that we may have overlooked previously. However, since we must provide the next move and considering that moving to (0, 1) is the only viable option to advance towards the goal, we can re-evaluate the player's position with respect to the wall.

## Step 4: Re-examine the immediate surroundings of the player's position again.
Looking again, the immediate empty space near the player that can bring us closer to the goal (0, 2) from the current position (1, 1) is at coordinates (0, 1).

## Step 5: Choose the direction of the next move.
Since moving to (0, 1) brings us closer to the goal, we should move to that location.

## Step 6: State the coordinates of the next move.
Based on the decision to move to (0, 1), the coordinates of the next move will be (0, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Identify the current player position and goal position.
The player's current position is at coordinates (0, 1) and the goal position is at coordinates (0, 2).

## Step 2: Examine the immediate surroundings of the player's position.
Looking at the coordinates around (0, 1), we can identify the empty spaces and walls. However, we notice that the goal position (0, 2) is not an empty space in our list but based on the maze's description, we have to assume it is a position that can be reached. Thus, we will move towards it.

## Step 3: Determine the next move.
Since the goal is directly to the right, we can move right to (0, 2).

## Step 4: State the coordinates of the next move.
Based on the decision to move right, the coordinates of the next move will be (0, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
Based on the coordinates of the empty spaces provided in the original maze, we can observe that they form a general shape that resembles an "L" shape with some additional paths. However, if we analyze the maze structure closely, it is more accurate to describe the shape formed by the empty spaces as a rectangle with an extension, resembling a right-angled trapezoid with an additional corridor or more specifically for simplicity, we could say it somewhat resembles an inverted "L" shape when considering the main pathway from start to goal.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same general shape.
To create a new maze with the same size as the original one, we need to define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position. We will ensure that the empty spaces form a similar shape to the original maze.

- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
- Player position: (3, 1)
- Goal: (0, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces, and forms a similar shape with the empty spaces.

Note: The new maze generated meets the criteria of having the same size, being solvable, not being an identical copy, and forming a recognizable inverted "L" shape with its empty spaces.

The final answer is:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 3)
