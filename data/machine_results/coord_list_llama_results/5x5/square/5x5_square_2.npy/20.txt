You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move. 

To start, I'll look at my current position (3, 2) and check the adjacent empty spaces in the up, down, left, and right direction.

Since I want to move towards the goal position (0, 2), I'll try to move up. The space above my current position is (2, 2), which is a wall. I'll have to avoid that.

Let me look at the other options. The space to the left of my current position is (3, 1), which is an empty space. The space to the right of my current position is (3, 3), which is also an empty space. Moving down would take me away from the goal, so I'll avoid that for now.

I'll choose to move to the left, as it seems to be a step in the right direction. My next move will be to (3, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 1), I'll examine my options again. I still want to move towards the goal position (0, 2).

Looking around, I see that the space above my current position is (2, 1), which is an empty space. That looks like a good move to make progress towards the goal.

Moving to the left would take me into a wall (3, 0), so that's not an option. Moving to the right would take me back to my previous position (3, 2), which isn't helpful. Moving down would also take me away from the goal, so I'll avoid that.

I'll choose to move up to (2, 1), as it seems to be a step in the right direction.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 1), I'll look around again. My goal is still (0, 2).

To the left of my current position is a wall (2, 0), so I won't move that way. To the right is a wall (2, 2), so that's also not an option. Moving down would take me back to my previous position (3, 1), which isn't helpful.

Looking up, I see the space (1, 1), which is an empty space. That seems like a good move to make progress towards the goal.

I'll choose to move up to (1, 1), as it gets me closer to the goal.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1, 1), I'm close to the goal, but there's still a small challenge ahead.

The goal is (0, 2), but I see that the space to the right of my current position is a wall (1, 2), blocking my direct path to the goal.

However, I can move to the left, to the space (0, 1), which is an empty space. From there, I might be able to move up or find another way to reach the goal.

I'll choose to move to the left, to (0, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting close!

Now that I'm at (0, 1), I'll look for a way to reach the goal (0, 2). Since I'm already at the correct x-coordinate (0), I just need to move up to the correct y-coordinate (2).

Moving up from (0, 1) would take me to the goal (0, 2), but I don't see it listed as an empty space. However, I notice that there are empty spaces above my current position, such as (0, 3) and (0, 4). This suggests that the maze might be allowing me to move up, even though the goal isn't explicitly listed as an empty space.

Assuming that's the case, I'll try to move up to (0, 2), which is the goal.

Please let me know if I've reached the goal or not!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors)**

The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the maze is an "L-shape".

**2. A new maze with the same L-shape**

Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces that form an L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please note that this new maze has a similar L-shape formed by the empty spaces, but it's not an identical copy of the original maze. The player position and goal have also been adjusted accordingly to ensure a valid path from P to G.
