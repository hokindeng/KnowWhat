You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move. 

To navigate from the current player position (3, 2) to the goal position (0, 2), I need to move left (decreasing the x-coordinate) while keeping the y-coordinate constant, and avoiding walls. Let's look at the positions immediately left of the current player position: 

* (2, 2) is a wall
* (1, 2) is also a wall

So I cannot move directly left. I will need to navigate through the empty spaces above or below to bypass these walls.

Let's look at the empty spaces above and below the current player position:

* (3, 1) is an empty space

I can move down to this space to start bypassing the walls to my left.

Next move: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

To continue navigating towards the goal position, I will look at the positions adjacent to the current player position (3, 1). 

Since my goal is to eventually move left, I'll prioritize moving left if possible. 

* (2, 1) is an empty space

I can move left to this space, which brings me closer to the goal.

Next move: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

From the current player position (2, 1), I'll look at the adjacent empty spaces. 

Since I want to move closer to the goal, which is to the left and slightly up, I'll consider moving up or left.

* (1, 1) is an empty space

I can move left to this space, which brings me closer to the goal.

Next move: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

From the current player position (1, 1), I'll look at the adjacent empty spaces. 

Since I want to move closer to the goal, which is to the left and slightly up, I'll consider moving up or left.

* (0, 1) is an empty space

I can move left to this space, which brings me closer to the goal.

Next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

I'm very close to the goal, but unfortunately, the space directly above the current player position (0, 1) is a wall is not available but we do have (0,2) is the goal directly above, some of the adjacent empty spaces ( 0,3 ) that  means moving right and then back left or waiting a correct correct option left . 

* (0, 2) No I'am ready.



Next move: ( no I have only moved to move right then ( 0,2 ) stay to not move

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "inverted L" or an "L-shape with an extension"

This name comes from the fact that the empty spaces form an L-shape from the top-left to the middle of the maze, and then extend down towards the bottom-right.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same general shape:
 
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (1, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, and its empty spaces form an inverted L-shape with an extension. The player position and goal are in different locations, but the shape of the corridors is the same.
