You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution assumes that the only viable next position is directly above the current position, without considering all possible adjacent empty spaces in the up, down, left, or right directions.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the walls and empty spaces
The maze consists of walls and empty spaces. We can move through empty spaces but not through walls.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player's current position is at (3, 2), and the goal is at (0, 2).

## Step 3: Explore possible moves from the current position
From the current position (3, 2), we need to look at all adjacent positions (up, down, left, right) that are empty spaces. We can move up to (3, 1), down to (3, 3), left to (2, 2) is blocked by a wall, or right to (3, there is no space to the right beyond the maze boundary).

## Step 4: Select a viable move towards the goal
Given that we want to reach (0, 2) and considering our possible moves from (3, 2), we should move to the first empty space in the left direction that brings us closer to the goal. Since (2, 2) is blocked by a wall, we'll consider (3, 1) or (3, 3). However, we missed checking if there's a path that could potentially lead us closer to the goal more efficiently by moving up first and then possibly left. Moving up to (3, 1) is our best immediate choice as it opens up potential paths leftward, which we should explore further in subsequent steps.

## Step 5: Choose the next position
Therefore, the coordinates of our next move are (3, 1), which given the initial logic presented about moving directly towards the goal should have been shown to potentially provide a path closer to the goal than was initially analyzed.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: None.
The original solution approach of analyzing the maze, identifying the player and goal positions, exploring possible moves, and selecting a viable move towards the goal is correct.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Analyze the walls and empty spaces
The maze's walls and empty spaces remain largely unchanged, with the only difference being the player's new position.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal
The player is now at (3, 1), and the goal remains at (0, 2).

## Step 3: Explore possible moves from the current position
From (3, 1), we can move up to (2, 1), down to no available space within the maze as (3, 0) is a wall, left to no available space within the maze as it would be out of bounds, or right to (3, 2) which is an empty space but does not directly move us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Select a viable move towards the goal
Given the options, the most direct move towards the goal is to move up to (2, 1).

## Step 5: Choose the next position
Therefore, the coordinates of our next move are up to (2, 1), as this is the only direct move we can make towards the goal.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

## Step 3: Explore possible moves from the current position
From (2, 1), we can move up to (1, 1), down to (3, 1) which is an empty space but moves us away from the goal, left to no available space within the maze as (2, 0) is a wall, or right to (2, 2) which is a wall.

## Step 4: Select a viable move towards the goal
Given the options, the most direct move towards the goal is to move up to (1, 1).

## Step 5: Choose the next position
Therefore, the coordinates of our next move are up to (1, 1), as this is the only direct move we can make towards the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a bent or L-shape.

2. Here's a new maze with the same size as the original, with a path that forms a similar L-shape:


Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)


The new maze has the same 5x5 size, with a valid L-shaped path that can be traversed from the player's starting position (3, 2) to the goal (0, 2) using the empty spaces. This maze is not an exact copy of the original, but its corridors still form an L-shape, meeting the required conditions.
