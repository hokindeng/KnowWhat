You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the maze and plan my next move. 

To navigate from the current player position (3, 2) to the goal position (0, 2), I need to move left (decreasing the x-coordinate) while keeping the y-coordinate constant.

Considering the empty spaces (path), I can move from the current position (3, 2) to (3, 1) which is adjacent and empty. Then, I can move from (3, 1) to (2, 1) which is again adjacent and empty.

So, my next move will be to (3, 1).

Next move coordinates: (3, 1)

Please update the maze with my new position. I'll be happy to plan the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I'll plan my next move.

My current position is (3, 1). I'll move left (decreasing the x-coordinate) to the adjacent empty space, which is (2, 1).

Next move coordinates: (2, 1)

Please update the maze with my new position. I'll continue to plan the next moves to reach the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.My current position is (2, 1). Since my ultimate goal is to reach (0, 2), which is above and to the left of my current position, I'll move left (decreasing the x-coordinate) to the adjacent empty space, which is (1, 1).

Next move coordinates: (1, 1)

Please update the maze with my new position. I'll continue to plan the next moves to reach the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.My current position is (1, 1). To get closer to the goal (0, 2), I need to move up and to the left. However, the space directly above me (1, 2) is a wall, and the space directly to my left (0, 1) is empty.

Since I can't move up, I'll move left to the adjacent empty space (0, 1). This will get me closer to the goal.

Next move coordinates: (0, 1)

Please update the maze with my new position. I'll plan the next moves to reach the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting close to the goal. My current position is (0, 1). To reach the goal (0, 2), I just need to move up. 

However, I notice that the space directly above me (0, 2) is not in the list of walls or empty spaces. This implies that it's the goal position itself, but I'll assume it's an empty space that allows me to move there.

Next move coordinates: (0, 2)

Please update the maze with my new position, which should be the goal. I think I've solved the maze!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Fun task!

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a "**staircase**" shape.

(2) Here's a new maze with the same size and a staircase-shaped path:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

This new maze has a staircase-shaped path from P to G, and it's not an identical copy of the original maze. Can you solve it?
