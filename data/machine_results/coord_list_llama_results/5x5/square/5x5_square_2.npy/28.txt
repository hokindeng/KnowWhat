You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.# Explanation
Incorrect Step: Step 4.
The original solution suggests moving to (3, 1), which indeed is an empty space and directly accessible. However, a more efficient approach to solving the maze would involve selecting the next move based on a strategy that aims to reach the goal more directly or with fewer steps. Since the goal is at (0, 2) and the current position is at (3, 2), a more strategic move would involve trying to reduce the horizontal distance to the goal more efficiently.


# Correct Solution

## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal
The player's current position is at (3, 2), and the goal is to reach (0, 2). The most direct path would be to move horizontally towards the goal.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
Given the current position (3, 2), possible moves are to the left or right, up or down, as long as the destination is an empty space. However, the goal is to the left and closer to the top of the maze.

## Step 3: Check for walls and empty spaces in possible moves
To the left of (3, 2), i.e., at (2, 2), there is a wall listed in the problem statement. Moving directly up or down from (3, 2) is also obstructed by walls or out of bounds. Moving right from (3, 2) does not bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the best move based on the goal position and maze layout
Since moving left is obstructed by a wall at (2, 2), and moving up directly is also obstructed, the best strategic move to make progress towards the goal (0, 2) would be to move up to (3, 1) or any other position that allows a clearer path towards the goal on the horizontal axis.

## Step 5: Choose the specific move
Considering strategic progress towards the goal and aiming to reduce the horizontal distance efficiently, moving to (3, 1) is indeed a viable option as suggested by the original solution. However, a mistake was made in overlooking a strategy that aims for a more direct reduction in horizontal distance. Given the constraints, moving to (3, 1) remains the best immediate option but recognizing this as part of a strategic error highlights the importance of planning moves ahead.

## Step 6: Reassess Move Strategic Implication
Upon reassessment, since we are aiming for (0, 2), and direct horizontal movement is preferred, yet blocked by walls, a vertical move is justified, targeting a position that eventually allows horizontal progress towards the goal. Given this, (3, 1) indeed becomes a correct step but with a clearer strategic justification focusing on eventual horizontal movement towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 3, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal
The player's current position is at (3, 1), and the goal is to reach (0, 2). The most direct path would be to move horizontally towards the goal, but there are walls obstructing direct horizontal movement.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
Given the current position (3, 1), possible moves are to the left or right, up or down, as long as the destination is an empty space. However, moving right would take us further from the goal, and moving down to (3, 0) is obstructed by a wall.

## Step 3: Check for walls and empty spaces in possible moves
Moving left from (3, 1) to (2, 1) is a possible move since (2, 1) is listed as an empty space.

## Step 4: Determine the best move based on the goal position and maze layout
Since moving left to (2, 1) brings us closer to the goal's vertical alignment and there are no better alternatives for making progress towards the goal, moving to (2, 1) is the best strategic move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 2, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal
The player's current position is at (2, 1), and the goal is to reach (0, 2). The most direct path would be to move horizontally towards the goal, but there are walls obstructing direct horizontal movement.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
Given the current position (2, 1), possible moves are to the left or right, up or down, as long as the destination is an empty space. However, moving right would take us further from the goal.

## Step 3: Check for walls and empty spaces in possible moves
Moving left from (2, 1) to (1, 1) is a possible move since (1, 1) is listed as an empty space.

## Step 4: Determine the best move based on the goal position and maze layout
Since moving left to (1, 1) brings us closer to the goal's vertical alignment and there are no better alternatives for making progress towards the goal, moving to (1, 1) is the best strategic move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 1, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal
The player's current position is at (1, 1), and the goal is to reach (0, 2). The goal is very close, but since there is a wall at (1, 2), direct movement towards the goal is not possible.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
Given the current position (1, 1), possible moves are to the left or right, up or down, as long as the destination is an empty space. However, moving down would take us further from the goal.

## Step 3: Check for walls and empty spaces in possible moves
Moving left from (1, 1) to (0, 1) is a possible move since (0, 1) is listed as an empty space.

## Step 4: Determine the best move based on the goal position and maze layout
Since moving left to (0, 1) brings us closer to the goal's vertical alignment and there are no better alternatives for making progress towards the goal, moving to (0, 1) is the best strategic move. Once at (0, 1), a move up would bring us directly to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  1\right)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and goal
The player's current position is at (0, 1), and the goal is to reach (0, 2). The goal is now directly above the player's position.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
Given the current position (0, 1), possible moves are to the left or right, up or down, as long as the destination is an empty space. However, moving left is not possible due to the boundary of the maze, and moving down or right would take us further from the goal.

## Step 3: Check for walls and empty spaces in possible moves
Moving up from (0, 1) to (0, 2) is the goal, but we need to check if it is actually possible. There is no wall listed at (0, 2) that would block this move.

## Step 4: Determine the best move based on the goal position and maze layout
Since moving up to (0, 2) brings us directly to the goal and there are no obstacles or better alternatives, moving to (0, 2) is the best and final move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\left( 0, \  2\right)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
Based on the original maze, the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a rectangle with a smaller rectangle or square "dent" or cutout from its side, but given the restrictions and paths, the closest simple geometric description could be debated. However, considering the nature of the maze and its solution path, it's more appropriate to describe the shape in terms of its functional path, which is more aligned with a winding or L-shaped path, especially when considering the actual path taken from the start to the end. Yet, simplistically, one might argue the overall empty space resembles a rectangle with obstructions.

## Step 2: Determine a more accurate geometric description
Upon closer inspection, and given the task to generalize the shape, it might be more accurate to describe the path itself rather than the overall shape of the empty spaces. The path from start to finish is essentially L-shaped or could be seen as a variant of an L-shape with additional turns due to the maze's restrictions.

## Step 3: Design a new maze with the same shape characteristics
To create a new maze with empty spaces forming a similar L-shaped path, we'll rearrange the walls and empty spaces while ensuring there's a valid path from P to G.

## Step 4: Specify the new maze configuration
Given the constraints and the aim to replicate the L-shaped path characteristic, here's a new maze configuration:

- Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 3), (1, 4)
- Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
- Player position: (3, 1)
- Goal: (0, 4)

This new maze maintains the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape or a winding path, similar to the functional description of the original maze's solution path.

The final answer is:

Maze Description:
Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 3), (1, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)
