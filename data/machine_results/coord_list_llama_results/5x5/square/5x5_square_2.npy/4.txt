You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. 

Considering the current player position is (3, 2), the goal is to reach (0, 2), and we can only move to adjacent empty spaces.

Available adjacent empty spaces are (3, 1) and (3, 3). Moving to (3, 1) doesn't get us closer to the goal, but moving to (3, 3) is a step in the right direction. From (3, 3), we can potentially move further towards the goal.

So, my next move would be to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Considering the current player position is (3, 3), and the goal is to reach (0, 2), I'll analyze the available options.

Available adjacent empty spaces are (3, 2), (3, 4), and none other. Moving to (3, 2) would be a step back, so I'll discard that option. Moving to (3, 4) might seem unrelated to the goal, but it's actually a strategic move, as I'll explain.

From (3, 4), we can potentially move to (2, 4), and then to (2, 1), which could eventually lead us to the goal or closer to it.

So, my next move would be to (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the current player position at (3, 4), my next move would be to (2, 4), as it's an adjacent empty space that gets me closer to the goal.

From (2, 4), I can potentially move to (2, 1), and from there, I can start working my way up towards the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as:

(1) An "L" shape.

The original maze had a distinctive L-shaped corridor that connected the starting point to the goal.

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original, a valid path from P to G, and forms an L-shaped corridor with its empty spaces. Note that this is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it shares the same general shape and properties.
