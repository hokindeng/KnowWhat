You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's analyze the maze and plan the next move. 

Considering the current player position is at (3, 2) and the goal is to reach (0, 2), we need to navigate upwards while avoiding walls.

The adjacent empty spaces to the current position are (3, 1) and (3, 3). However, to reach the goal, we should prioritize moving up. The wall at (2, 2) blocks our direct path, so we should navigate around it.

The next move should be to (3, 1), as it allows us to potentially move up and then left to reach the goal.

The coordinates of the next move are: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the current player position at (3, 1), I need to continue navigating towards the goal at (0, 2).

Looking at the adjacent empty spaces, I have (2, 1) as the best option to move closer to the goal. Moving up to (2, 1) will bring me closer to the goal and allow me to reassess the path.

The coordinates of the next move are: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 1), I can see that the wall at (1, 2) and (2, 2) blocks my direct path to the goal. However, I can try to move around it by going to (1, 1), which would bring me closer to the goal and give me more options.

The coordinates of the next move are: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting close to the goal. Since I'm at (1, 1), I want to try to get closer to the goal, but the wall at (1, 2) is still in the way.

In this case, I can move to (0, 1) to get around the wall. From there, I might be able to move up or right to reach the goal.

The coordinates of the next move are: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0, 1), I want to move directly to the goal if possible.

Since (0, 2) is the goal and it is directly adjacent to my current position, I will attempt to move there.

The coordinates of the next move are: (0, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "zig-zag path" or a "serpentine path".

Here's a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (0, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a zig-zag path that allows the player to navigate from the starting position to the goal. Note that the maze is not identical to the original, but the general shape of the path is recognizable as a zig-zag or serpentine shape.
