You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or matrix, which is essentially what our maze is.

First, let's clarify the maze's layout based on the given information:

- Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
- Empty Spaces (Path): (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- Player Position: (0, 3)
- Goal: (4, 1)

Given the player's current position is (0, 3), and the goal is (4, 1), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

Since we can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals), we'll consider all possible moves from the current position.

The current position is (0, 3), so let's examine the possible moves:

1. Up: (0, 2) - This is an empty space.
2. Down: Not possible without hitting a wall or going out of bounds.
3. Left: Not possible without hitting a wall or going out of bounds.
4. Right: Not possible without hitting a wall or going out of bounds.
5. Diagonals: The only feasible diagonal move from (0, 3) would be towards (1, 2) or (1, 4), but both are walls.

Given these constraints, the only valid move from (0, 3) is up to (0, 2).

Therefore, my next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), let's examine the possible moves:

1. Up: (0, 1) - This is an empty space.
2. Down: (0, 3) - This is an empty space, but it's the previous position, so it's not a good choice.
3. Left: Not possible without going out of bounds.
4. Right: (1, 2) - This is a wall.
5. Diagonals: The only feasible diagonal move from (0, 2) would be towards (1, 1) or (1, 3), but (1, 1) is a wall, and (1, 3) is a possible move.

Considering the options, the best move would be to (1, 3) diagonally, as it moves us closer to the goal and avoids walls.

Therefore, my next move is to (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 3), let's examine the possible moves:

1. Up: Not possible without hitting a wall.
2. Down: Not possible without hitting a wall.
3. Left: Not possible without hitting a wall.
4. Right: (2, 3) - This is a wall.
5. Diagonals: The only feasible diagonal move from (1, 3) would be towards (2, 2) or (2, 4), but (2, 4) is a wall.

Considering the options, the best move would be to (2, 2) diagonally, as it moves us closer to the goal and avoids walls.

Therefore, my next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), let's examine the possible moves:

1. Up: Not possible without hitting a wall.
2. Down: Not possible without hitting a wall.
3. Left: Not possible without hitting a wall.
4. Right: (3, 2) - This is a wall.
5. Diagonals: The only feasible diagonal move from (2, 2) would be towards (3, 1).

Considering the options, the best move would be to (3, 1) diagonally, as it moves us closer to the goal and avoids walls.

Therefore, my next move is to (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 1), let's examine the possible moves:

1. Up: Not possible without hitting a wall.
2. Down: Not possible without hitting a wall.
3. Left: Not possible without hitting a wall.
4. Right: (4, 1) - This is the goal position.

Considering the options, the best move would be to (4, 1) to the right, as it directly reaches the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Zigzag" or a "Winding Path".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag or winding path shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 2)

This new maze has a similar zigzag or winding path shape, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The path from the player position to the goal is still navigable through the empty spaces.
