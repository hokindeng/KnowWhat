You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or matrix, which is the case here since all moves (up, down, left, right, diagonals) are considered equal.

Given the current player position is (0, 3) and the goal is (4, 1), we'll start by exploring all possible moves from the current position and then proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Identify Possible Moves from the Current Position

From (0, 3), considering the maze layout, the possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 2)
- Down: Not possible due to the wall at (1, 3) and the player's position being at the edge in the vertical direction.
- Left: Not possible since moving left would put the player out of the maze boundaries.
- Right: (1, 3)
- Diagonals: (1, 2), (1, 4)

However, considering the walls and the goal to move towards (4, 1), the most promising first move would be to move right to (1, 3), as it keeps the player within the maze and moves them closer to the goal in a general sense.

### Next Move Coordinates

The next move would be to (1, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect this new position and provide the updated maze for the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.### Step 2: Analyze the Current Position and Determine the Next Move

From the current position (1, 3), we need to navigate towards the goal (4, 1). Given the maze layout, the possible moves from (1, 3) are limited due to the walls.

Possible moves:
- Up: Not possible due to the wall at (1, 2).
- Down: Not possible due to the wall at (2, 3).
- Left: (0, 3) - This would be moving back, which is not ideal.
- Right: (2, 3) - This is blocked by a wall.
- Diagonals: The only viable diagonal move is (2, 2), as other diagonal moves are either out of bounds or blocked by walls.

Given the constraints, the best move is to (2, 2) diagonally, as it moves the player closer to the goal and avoids backtracking.

### Next Move Coordinates

The next move would be to (2, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect this new position and provide the updated maze for the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.### Step 3: Analyze the Current Position and Determine the Next Move

From the current position (2, 2), we aim to move closer to the goal (4, 1). Considering the maze layout and the walls, the possible moves are:

Possible moves:
- Up: Not possible due to the wall at (2, 1).
- Down: (3, 2) - This is a viable move.
- Left: (1, 2) - This is blocked by a wall.
- Right: (3, 2) is a possible move but moving down is more direct towards the goal.
- Diagonals: Moving diagonally down-right to (3, 3) is blocked by a wall, but moving diagonally down-left to (3, 1) is a viable option and moves closer to the goal.

Given the options, the best move is to (3, 1) diagonally, as it moves the player closer to the goal and avoids unnecessary backtracking or sideways movement.

### Next Move Coordinates

The next move would be to (3, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect this new position and provide the updated maze for the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.### Step 4: Analyze the Current Position and Determine the Next Move

From the current position (3, 1), we are very close to the goal (4, 1). The only viable move to reach the goal directly is to move right.

Possible moves:
- Up: Not possible due to the wall at (3, 0).
- Down: Not necessary as the goal is at the same vertical level.
- Left: (2, 1) - This would be moving back, which is not ideal.
- Right: (4, 1) - This is the goal position.
- Diagonals: Not necessary as a direct right move reaches the goal.

Given the options, the best and final move is to (4, 1) to the right, which directly reaches the goal.

### Next Move Coordinates

The next move would be to (4, 1).

This move should solve the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) General Shape of the Original Maze

The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "Zigzag" or more specifically, a "Staircase" shape, given the diagonal and horizontal movements required to navigate from the start to the goal.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces that form a similar "Staircase" shape. The player starts at (0, 0) and the goal is at (4, 4).

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze requires a similar navigation pattern to the original, involving diagonal and horizontal movements to reach the goal from the start, while avoiding walls.
