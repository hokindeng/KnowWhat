You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or matrix, which is the case here since all movements (up, down, left, right, diagonals) are considered equal.

First, let's define the possible movements in terms of changes in coordinates (dx, dy):

- Up: (0, -1)
- Down: (0, 1)
- Left: (-1, 0)
- Right: (1, 0)
- Up-Left: (-1, -1)
- Up-Right: (1, -1)
- Down-Left: (-1, 1)
- Down-Right: (1, 1)

Given the player's current position is (0, 3) and the goal is (4, 1), we'll start by exploring all possible moves from the current position and then proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Explore Possible Moves from (0, 3)

From (0, 3), considering the maze layout, the possible moves are limited due to the walls and the maze's boundaries. The only valid move from (0, 3) is to move down to (1, 3) since moving up, left, or right would either hit a wall or be out of bounds, and moving diagonally down-left or down-right is not possible due to walls or being out of bounds.

### Next Move: (1, 3)

This move is chosen because it's the only valid move from the starting position that does not result in hitting a wall or moving out of the maze's boundaries.

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position at (1, 3), and I'll proceed with the next step based on the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.### Step 2: Explore Possible Moves from (1, 3)

From the current position (1, 3), considering the maze layout, the possible moves are:

- Down to (2, 3): Not possible due to a wall at (2, 3).
- Right to (1, 4): Not possible due to a wall at (1, 4).
- Down-Right to (2, 4): Not possible due to a wall at (2, 4).
- Up to (0, 3): Already visited, and moving back does not bring us closer to the goal.
- Up-Right to (0, 4): Possible, but it does not bring us closer to the goal directly.
- Left to (0, 3): Already visited, and moving back does not bring us closer to the goal.
- Up-Left to (0, 2): Possible, but it does not bring us closer to the goal directly.
- Down-Left to (0, 2): Not possible since we cannot move diagonally in this direction from (1, 3).
- Right to (2, 3) is not possible, but moving right to (2, 2) is possible since (2, 2) is an empty space.

### Next Move: (2, 2)

This move is chosen because it's a valid move that brings us closer to the goal by moving down and slightly to the right, navigating through the empty spaces.

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position at (2, 2), and I'll proceed with the next step based on the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.### Step 3: Explore Possible Moves from (2, 2)

From the current position (2, 2), considering the maze layout, the possible moves are:

- Up to (1, 2): Not possible due to a wall at (1, 2).
- Down to (3, 2): Not possible due to a wall at (3, 2).
- Left to (1, 2): Not possible due to a wall at (1, 2).
- Right to (3, 2): Not possible due to a wall at (3, 2).
- Up-Left to (1, 1): Not possible due to a wall at (1, 1).
- Up-Right to (3, 1): Possible, as (3, 1) is an empty space.
- Down-Left to (1, 1): Not possible due to a wall at (1, 1).
- Down-Right to (3, 3): Not possible due to a wall at (3, 3).

### Next Move: (3, 1)

This move is chosen because it's a valid move that brings us closer to the goal by moving down and slightly to the right, navigating through the empty spaces.

Please update the maze to reflect the new player position at (3, 1), and I'll proceed with the next step based on the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.### Step 4: Explore Possible Moves from (3, 1)

From the current position (3, 1), considering the maze layout, the possible moves are:

- Up to (2, 1): Not possible since (2, 1) is a wall.
- Down to (4, 1): Possible, as (4, 1) is the goal position.
- Left to (2, 1): Not possible since (2, 1) is a wall.
- Right to (4, 1): Possible, as (4, 1) is the goal position.
- Up-Left to (2, 0): Not possible due to a wall at (2, 0).
- Up-Right to (4, 0): Possible, but it does not bring us directly to the goal.
- Down-Left to (2, 0): Not possible due to a wall at (2, 0).
- Down-Right to (4, 2): Possible, but it does not bring us directly to the goal.

### Next Move: (4, 1)

This move is chosen because it directly reaches the goal position, which is the ultimate objective.

Congratulations, we have reached the goal! The maze has been solved.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) General Shape of the Original Maze

The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "Zigzag" or more specifically, a "Staircase" shape, given the way the empty spaces are arranged in a step-like pattern.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces that form a similar "Staircase" shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 2)

This new maze maintains the same size and general shape as the original, with a staircase-like pattern of empty spaces. However, the specific arrangement of walls and empty spaces is different, ensuring it's not an identical copy of the original maze.
