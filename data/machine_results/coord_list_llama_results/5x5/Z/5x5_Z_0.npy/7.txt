You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or matrix, such as our maze. However, given the constraints of the problem and the format requested, I'll describe the approach and provide the next move directly.

### Approach:

1. **Define the Maze**: Represent the maze as a grid where walls are marked as 'W', empty spaces as 'E', the player position as 'P', and the goal as 'G'.
2. **BFS Algorithm**: Start from the player position, explore all adjacent empty spaces (up, down, left, right, and diagonals), mark them as visited, and add them to a queue. Continue this process until the goal is reached or all reachable empty spaces have been visited.
3. **Next Move**: The next move will be the first step in the shortest path found by the BFS algorithm.

### Next Move Calculation:

Given the complexity of manually executing the BFS algorithm in this format, I'll directly provide the next move based on the initial setup and the goal of reaching (4, 1) from (0, 3).

The maze's layout suggests that moving diagonally or horizontally/vertically to an adjacent empty space is the first step. Given the player's position at (0, 3) and the goal at (4, 1), a logical first move would be to move towards the goal while avoiding walls.

### Next Move:

Considering the maze's layout and the goal, a reasonable next move from (0, 3) would be to move to (1, 3), as it is an empty space and brings the player closer to the goal while avoiding the wall at (1, 2).

**Next Move Coordinates:** (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we'll continue to navigate towards the goal (4, 1) from the current player position (1, 3).

### Next Move Calculation:

Looking at the maze, the most direct path to the goal involves moving down and then left. However, we need to avoid the walls and find a path through the empty spaces.

A possible next move from (1, 3) is to move down to (2, 3), but since (2, 3) is a wall, we need to find an alternative. Moving down to (2, 2) is an option, as it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

### Next Move:

Considering the maze's layout and the goal, a reasonable next move from (1, 3) would be to move to (2, 2), as it is an empty space and allows us to continue navigating towards the goal.

**Next Move Coordinates:** (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we'll continue to navigate towards the goal (4, 1) from the current player position (2, 2).

### Next Move Calculation:

Looking at the maze, we need to move down and then left to reach the goal. Since we are currently at (2, 2), we can move down to (3, 2), but since (3, 2) is a wall, we need to find an alternative.

A possible next move from (2, 2) is to move down to (3, 1), as it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

### Next Move:

Considering the maze's layout and the goal, a reasonable next move from (2, 2) would be to move to (3, 1), as it is an empty space and allows us to continue navigating towards the goal.

**Next Move Coordinates:** (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we'll continue to navigate towards the goal (4, 1) from the current player position (3, 1).

### Next Move Calculation:

Looking at the maze, we are now very close to the goal. Since we are currently at (3, 1) and the goal is at (4, 1), we can move directly to the goal.

### Next Move:

Considering the maze's layout and the goal, a reasonable next move from (3, 1) would be to move to (4, 1), as it is the goal position.

**Next Move Coordinates:** (4, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**General Shape of the Original Maze:**

The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "Zigzag" or "Winding Path". The path twists and turns, avoiding the walls and navigating through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

**New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag or winding path:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 2)

This new maze has a similar zigzag or winding path formed by the empty spaces, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The path from the player position to the goal can be navigated through the empty spaces, avoiding the walls.
