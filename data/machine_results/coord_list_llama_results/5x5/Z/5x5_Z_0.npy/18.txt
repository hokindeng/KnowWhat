You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or matrix, which is essentially what our maze is.

First, let's understand the maze layout and the rules:

- Walls are at positions: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
- Empty spaces (paths) are at positions: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- The player starts at position: (0, 3)
- The goal is at position: (4, 1)

Given the player's starting position (0, 3) and the goal (4, 1), we need to find a path that avoids walls and only moves through empty spaces.

Since we can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals), we'll consider all possible moves from the current position.

From the starting position (0, 3), the possible moves are limited by the walls and the maze boundaries. The immediate next steps could be moving down to (1, 3) since it's an empty space and directly below the starting position, which is a valid move according to the problem statement.

Therefore, my next move would be to position (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (1, 3), we need to find a valid move that brings us closer to the goal at (4, 1).

Looking at the maze, moving directly to the right is not possible due to the wall at (2, 3). However, we can move down to (2, 3) is not possible, but we can move down to (2, 2) is a valid move since it's an empty space.

Therefore, my next move would be to position (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (2, 2), we need to find a valid move that brings us closer to the goal at (4, 1).

Looking at the maze, moving down to (3, 2) is not possible due to the wall at (3, 2). However, we can move down to (3, 1) is a valid move since it's an empty space and it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to position (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (3, 1), we need to find a valid move that brings us closer to the goal at (4, 1).

Looking at the maze, moving right to (4, 1) is a valid move since it's an empty space and it directly reaches the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to position (4, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or more specifically, a "staircase" shape, with a series of connected L-shapes.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar staircase shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

This new maze has a staircase-shaped path from the player's starting position to the goal, with a series of connected L-shapes. It is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it shares the same general shape and size.
