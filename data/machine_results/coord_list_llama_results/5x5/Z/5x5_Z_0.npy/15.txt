You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or matrix, such as our maze. However, given the constraints of the problem and the format requested, I'll describe the approach and provide the next move directly.

### Approach:
1. **Identify Possible Moves**: From any given position, identify all possible moves (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) that do not result in hitting a wall or moving out of the maze boundaries.
2. **BFS Exploration**: Explore the maze level by level, starting from the player's position, marking visited positions to avoid loops.
3. **Goal Check**: Stop the exploration once the goal position is reached.

### Next Move Calculation:
Given the player's current position is (0, 3) and the goal is (4, 1), we'll calculate the next move by considering the possible moves that bring us closer to the goal without hitting walls.

- **Current Position**: (0, 3)
- **Goal Position**: (4, 1)

Looking at the maze layout, a direct diagonal move towards the goal would be ideal, but we must avoid walls. The first move should aim to get closer to the goal while navigating through empty spaces.

### Next Move:
Considering the constraints and aiming to move diagonally or directly towards the goal, a feasible next move from (0, 3) would be to move down and to the right, avoiding the wall at (1, 2) and (1, 4). However, since we can move diagonally and there are no walls directly blocking a diagonal move to the right and down from the starting position, we can consider moving to (1, 2) is not possible due to the wall, so we look for the next best diagonal or direct move.

Given the layout, moving directly to the right is not possible due to the wall at (1, 3) being absent but surrounded by walls, making (1, 3) a critical path point but not directly reachable from (0, 3) without hitting a wall. Thus, considering diagonal moves and the need to avoid walls, the best initial move, given the constraints and aiming for a path that could lead towards the goal efficiently, involves navigating through the available empty spaces.

However, upon reevaluation for a precise next step considering the direct request for the next move without the full path and acknowledging the misinterpretation of the direct diagonal move feasibility due to the wall's presence:

The correct approach involves analyzing the maze for the shortest path while avoiding walls, which typically would involve moving towards the goal in a manner that respects the maze's constraints. Given the initial setup and the goal, the direct path involves navigating around the walls.

Given the constraints and the need for a step-by-step solution without visual aids or further iterative calculations provided in this response, the precise next move calculation would ideally involve identifying the closest empty space that moves towards the goal while avoiding walls, considering the maze's layout and the movement rules (up, down, left, right, diagonals).

For an accurate next move, considering the direct path and avoiding walls, and given the complexity of detailing each step in text without visual aids, the approach would involve analyzing the maze to find a path that adheres to the movement rules and avoids obstacles.

Given the initial position (0, 3) and the goal (4, 1), and acknowledging the need for a direct answer:

The final answer is: $\boxed{(0, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state and the player's current position at (0, 2), we need to find a move that brings us closer to the goal at (4, 1) while avoiding walls.

Looking at the maze, moving directly down is not possible due to the wall at (1, 2). However, we can move to the right, as (1, 3) is an empty space.

### Next Move:
Considering the constraints and aiming to move towards the goal, a feasible next move from (0, 2) would be to move to the right, to the empty space at (1, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state and the player's current position at (1, 3), we need to find a move that brings us closer to the goal at (4, 1) while avoiding walls.

Looking at the maze, moving down is not possible due to the wall at (2, 3). However, we can move to the right and down diagonally to (2, 2), which is an empty space.

### Next Move:
Considering the constraints and aiming to move towards the goal, a feasible next move from (1, 3) would be to move diagonally down and to the right, to the empty space at (2, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 2)}$

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state and the player's current position at (2, 2), we need to find a move that brings us closer to the goal at (4, 1) while avoiding walls.

Looking at the maze, moving down is not possible due to the wall at (3, 2). However, we can move to the right and down diagonally, but that would also be blocked by walls. The best option is to move down and to the left diagonally, but since we can't move down, we should consider moving to the right and then finding a path down.

However, a more direct approach would be to move down and to the right diagonally is not possible, so we look for the next best move. Moving directly to the right is not possible due to the wall at (2, 3) and (2, 4), but moving down and to the left is also not possible due to the wall at (3, 2). 

Considering the constraints and aiming to move towards the goal, a feasible next move from (2, 2) would be to move to the left, to the empty space at (1, 3), but that would be moving away from the goal. However, moving to the left and then down might be a viable path.

A better approach is to move to the right and find a path down. However, since moving directly to the right is blocked by walls, we should consider moving down and to the left, but that is also blocked by walls.

Given the constraints, a feasible next move from (2, 2) would be to move to the left, to the empty space at (1, 3), but that would be moving away from the goal. However, moving to the left and then down might be a viable path.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state and the player's current position at (3, 1), we need to find a move that brings us closer to the goal at (4, 1) while avoiding walls.

Looking at the maze, we can see that the goal is directly to the right of our current position. Since there are no walls blocking our path, we can move directly to the right.

### Next Move:
Considering the constraints and aiming to move towards the goal, a feasible next move from (3, 1) would be to move directly to the right, to the empty space at (4, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 1)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Zigzag" or "Winding Path".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag or winding path shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

This new maze has a similar zigzag or winding path shape, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The player can navigate from the starting position (0, 3) to the goal (4, 1) through the empty spaces, avoiding the walls.
