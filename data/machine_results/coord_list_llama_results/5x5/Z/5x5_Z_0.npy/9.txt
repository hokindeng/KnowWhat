You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or matrix, which is essentially what our maze is.

First, let's understand the maze layout and the rules:

- Walls are at positions: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
- Empty spaces (paths) are at positions: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- The player starts at position: (0, 3)
- The goal is at position: (4, 1)

Given the player's starting position (0, 3) and the goal (4, 1), and considering we can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals), we'll look for the next best move.

Since the goal is to reach (4, 1) from (0, 3), we should aim to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. The most direct path would involve moving down and right. However, we need to consider the walls and empty spaces.

A possible first move, considering the constraints and aiming to move closer to the goal, would be to move diagonally down and right if possible, or right if diagonal movement is blocked by a wall.

Given the layout, moving directly down from (0, 3) is not possible due to the wall at (1, 3) not being a direct block but considering the overall path, moving right is a viable first step to get closer to the goal and avoid the wall at (1, 3) which is not directly in the path but part of the wall structure.

Therefore, my next move would be to (0, 4), as it moves the player closer to the goal and avoids walls, setting up for further diagonal or horizontal movement towards the goal.

The next move is: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we need to continue moving towards the goal (4, 1) from the current position (0, 4).

Looking at the maze, moving directly down from (0, 4) is not possible due to the wall at (1, 4). However, we can move down and left to navigate around the wall.

A viable next move would be to move down to (1, 3), which is an empty space and allows us to continue moving towards the goal while avoiding walls.

The next move is: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we need to continue moving towards the goal (4, 1) from the current position (1, 3).

Looking at the maze, moving directly down from (1, 3) is not possible due to the wall at (2, 3). However, we can move down and left to navigate around the wall, but a more direct approach would be to move down and right, but that's also blocked by the wall at (2, 4).

A viable next move would be to move right to (2, 3) is not possible, so we move down to (2, 2), which is an empty space and allows us to continue moving towards the goal while avoiding walls.

The next move is: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we need to continue moving towards the goal (4, 1) from the current position (2, 2).

Looking at the maze, moving directly down from (2, 2) is not possible due to the wall at (3, 2). However, we can move down and left to navigate around the wall.

A viable next move would be to move down and left to (3, 1), which is an empty space and allows us to continue moving towards the goal while avoiding walls.

The next move is: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we need to continue moving towards the goal (4, 1) from the current position (3, 1).

Looking at the maze, we can see that the goal is directly to the right of our current position. Since there are no walls blocking our path, we can move directly to the right.

A viable next move would be to move right to (4, 1), which is the goal position.

The next move is: (4, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Zigzag" or "Winding" path, but more specifically, it resembles a "Staircase" shape, with a series of connected right angles and straight segments.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "Staircase" shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 2)

This new maze has a similar "Staircase" shape, with a winding path that connects the player position to the goal. Note that the specific arrangement of walls and empty spaces is different from the original maze, but the overall shape of the path is recognizable as a "Staircase".
