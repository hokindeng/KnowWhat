You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or matrix, such as our maze. However, since we're asked for a step-by-step solution and not the entire path at once, we'll adapt the BFS approach to find the next move.

Given the current player position (P) is at (0, 3) and the goal (G) is at (4, 1), let's analyze the maze:

1. **Current Position**: (0, 3)
2. **Goal Position**: (4, 1)
3. **Walls**: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
4. **Empty Spaces**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

To find the next move, we'll consider all possible adjacent moves (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) from the current position (0, 3) and choose the one that moves us closer to the goal or keeps us on a path towards the goal without hitting a wall.

**Possible Moves from (0, 3)**:
- Up: (0, 2) - Valid move, moves closer to the goal horizontally.
- Down: Not possible due to the wall at (1, 3) being a required next step to move down.
- Left: Not applicable as we're already at the left edge.
- Right: (1, 3) - Valid move, directly moves towards the goal.
- Diagonals: Moving diagonally up-right (1, 2) is blocked by a wall, and moving diagonally down-right is not directly beneficial.

Given these options, the best next move to make progress towards the goal while avoiding walls is to move **right** to (1, 3). This move keeps us on a path that could potentially lead to the goal without immediately hitting a wall.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state with the player position at (1, 3), let's analyze the possible next moves:

**Current Position**: (1, 3)
**Goal Position**: (4, 1)
**Walls**: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
**Empty Spaces**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

Considering all possible adjacent moves (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) from the current position (1, 3), we need to find a move that brings us closer to the goal or keeps us on a path towards the goal without hitting a wall.

**Possible Moves from (1, 3)**:
- Up: Not possible due to the wall at (1, 2).
- Down: Not possible due to the wall at (1, 4).
- Left: (0, 3) - Valid move, but it's a step back.
- Right: (2, 3) - Not possible due to the wall at (2, 3).
- Diagonals: Moving diagonally up-right (2, 2) is a valid move and moves closer to the goal.

Given these options, the best next move to make progress towards the goal while avoiding walls is to move **diagonally up-right** to (2, 2). This move keeps us on a path that could potentially lead to the goal without immediately hitting a wall.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state with the player position at (2, 2), let's analyze the possible next moves:

**Current Position**: (2, 2)
**Goal Position**: (4, 1)
**Walls**: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
**Empty Spaces**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

Considering all possible adjacent moves (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) from the current position (2, 2), we need to find a move that brings us closer to the goal or keeps us on a path towards the goal without hitting a wall.

**Possible Moves from (2, 2)**:
- Up: Not possible due to the wall at (2, 1).
- Down: Not possible due to the wall at (2, 3).
- Left: Not applicable as moving left would not bring us closer to the goal.
- Right: (3, 2) - Not possible due to the wall at (3, 2).
- Diagonals: Moving diagonally down-right (3, 1) is a valid move and moves closer to the goal.

Given these options, the best next move to make progress towards the goal while avoiding walls is to move **diagonally down-right** to (3, 1). This move keeps us on a path that could potentially lead to the goal without immediately hitting a wall.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

**Empty Spaces**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

Considering all possible adjacent moves (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) from the current position (3, 1), we need to find a move that brings us closer to the goal or keeps us on a path towards the goal without hitting a wall.

**Possible Moves from (3, 1)**:
- Up: Not possible due to the wall at (3, 0).
- Down: Not possible due to the wall at (3, 2).
- Left: Not applicable as moving left would not bring us closer to the goal.
- Right: (4, 1) - Valid move, directly moves to the goal.
- Diagonals: Not necessary as a direct move to the goal is available.

Given these options, the best next move to make progress towards the goal while avoiding walls is to move **right** to (4, 1). This move directly reaches the goal.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (4, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Path:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a **"Zigzag"** or more specifically, a **"Staircase"** shape, as the path moves in a zigzag pattern from the top-left to the bottom-right of the maze.

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces that form a similar "Staircase" shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 2)

This new maze has a similar "Staircase" shape formed by the empty spaces, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The path from the player position (P) to the goal (G) can be reached through the empty spaces, and the maze meets the specified criteria.
