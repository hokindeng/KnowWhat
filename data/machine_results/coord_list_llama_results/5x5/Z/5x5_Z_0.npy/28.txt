You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or matrix, such as our maze. However, given the constraints of the problem and the format requested, I'll guide you through the thought process step by step, but I'll directly provide the next move based on the initial setup.

Given the maze's layout, the player's position is at (0, 3), and the goal is at (4, 1). The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) to an adjacent empty space.

1. **Current Position**: (0, 3)
2. **Goal**: (4, 1)

Looking at the maze, the most direct path to the goal while avoiding walls would involve moving down and then navigating through the empty spaces. However, since we can move diagonally, we can potentially shorten the path.

**Next Move**: Considering the direct path and the ability to move diagonally, a good next move would be to move diagonally down and to the right, aiming to get closer to the goal while avoiding the walls.

Given the constraints and aiming for a direct path, the next move would be to (1, 4) or (2, 3) considering diagonal moves are allowed and aiming to bypass the walls efficiently. However, since (1, 4) is a wall, the best diagonal move in this context, considering the maze's layout and the goal's position, would actually be to move down to (1, 3), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal while setting up for further diagonal or horizontal moves.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (1, 3)

This move is chosen because it directly moves towards the goal, avoids walls, and sets up for potential diagonal moves in subsequent steps, which could shorten the path to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we're now at position (1, 3). Our goal is to reach (4, 1). We need to navigate through the empty spaces while avoiding the walls.

Looking at the maze, moving directly down is not possible due to the wall at (2, 3). However, we can move diagonally down and to the right or simply move right and then down.

**Next Move**: Considering the layout, moving right to (1, 4) is not possible because it's a wall. So, the best move would be to move down and to the right diagonally to (2, 4), but since (2, 4) is a wall, we should instead move right to an empty space that allows us to progress towards the goal.

However, since moving directly right or down is blocked by walls in some directions, and considering the goal's position, a strategic move would be to move down to the only available empty space that brings us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (2, 2)

This move is chosen because it moves us closer to the goal, avoids walls, and sets up for potential further moves that could bring us closer to the goal, considering the maze's layout and the goal's position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we're now at position (2, 2). Our goal is to reach (4, 1). We need to navigate through the empty spaces while avoiding the walls.

Looking at the maze, moving directly down is not possible due to the wall at (2, 3). However, we can move right or down and to the left diagonally to get closer to the goal.

**Next Move**: Considering the layout, moving right is not directly beneficial as it doesn't bring us closer to the goal. Moving down and to the left diagonally to (3, 1) is a good option because it brings us closer to the goal and avoids walls.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (3, 1)

This move is chosen because it moves us closer to the goal, avoids walls, and sets up for potential further moves that could bring us directly to the goal, considering the maze's layout and the goal's position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we're now at position (3, 1). Our goal is to reach (4, 1). We need to navigate through the empty spaces while avoiding the walls.

Looking at the maze, we are directly above the goal. Since we can move down, we can directly reach the goal.

**Next Move**: Moving down to (4, 1) is the most direct and efficient move, as it brings us directly to the goal.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (4, 1)

This move is chosen because it directly reaches the goal, avoiding any unnecessary moves or potential dead ends.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Zigzag" or more specifically, a "Staircase" shape, as the path winds its way down and to the right in a series of connected, right-angled turns.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "Staircase" shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 2)

This new maze has a similar "Staircase" shape formed by its empty spaces, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The path from the player position to the goal can be navigated through the empty spaces, and the maze meets all the required criteria.
