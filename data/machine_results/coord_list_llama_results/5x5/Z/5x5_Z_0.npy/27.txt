You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints, a suitable approach is to use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is particularly effective for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or grid, such as this maze.

First, let's understand the maze layout and the rules:

- **Walls** are at coordinates: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
- **Empty spaces** (path) are at coordinates: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Player position** is at: (0, 3)
- **Goal** is at: (4, 1)

Given the player's current position at (0, 3), the next move should aim to get closer to the goal at (4, 1) while avoiding walls and only moving through empty spaces.

Since we can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals), we'll look for the closest empty space that moves us towards the goal.

From (0, 3), moving directly towards the goal is not possible due to the wall at (1, 3) not being a direct block but considering the overall path, a good initial move would be to move down to (1, 3), but since that's not directly possible due to the wall's placement, we look for an alternative that moves us closer to the goal.

A viable next move, considering the constraints and aiming to move closer to the goal, would be to move to (0, 2), as it's an empty space and keeps us open to move towards the goal in subsequent steps.

Therefore, my next move would be to **(0, 2)**.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state with the player position at (0, 2), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 1) while avoiding walls and only moving through empty spaces.

Looking at the maze, a direct path to the goal is still not possible due to the walls. However, we can move to an adjacent empty space that brings us closer to the goal.

A good next move would be to move to (1, 3), as it's an empty space and moves us in the general direction of the goal. This move also sets us up for potential future moves that could navigate around the walls more effectively.

Therefore, my next move would be to **(1, 3)**.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state with the player position at (1, 3), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 1) while avoiding walls and only moving through empty spaces.

From (1, 3), we can see that moving directly down is blocked by walls, and moving left would take us back to the starting area. Moving right or diagonally right seems promising, but we need to find a path that avoids the walls.

A good next move would be to move to (2, 2), as it's an empty space and moves us in the general direction of the goal. This move also sets us up for potential future moves that could navigate around the walls more effectively.

Therefore, my next move would be to **(2, 2)**.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state with the player position at (2, 2), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 1) while avoiding walls and only moving through empty spaces.

From (2, 2), we can see that moving directly down is blocked by walls, and moving left would take us back to the starting area. Moving right seems promising, but we need to find a path that avoids the walls.

A good next move would be to move to (3, 1), as it's an empty space and moves us in the general direction of the goal. This move also sets us up for potential future moves that could navigate around the walls more effectively.

Therefore, my next move would be to **(3, 1)**.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state with the player position at (3, 1), we can see that we are now very close to the goal at (4, 1).

Since the goal is directly to the right of our current position, and there are no walls blocking our path, we can make a straightforward move to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to **(4, 1)**.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Zigzag" or more specifically, a "Staircase" shape, with a series of connected L-shapes that form a winding path from the player position to the goal.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "Staircase" shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 2)

This new maze has a similar "Staircase" shape formed by the empty spaces, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The player position is at (0, 0), and the goal is at (4, 2).
