You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or matrix, which is the case here since all movements (up, down, left, right, diagonals) are considered equal.

First, let's define the movements in terms of changes in x and y coordinates:

- Up: (0, -1)
- Down: (0, 1)
- Left: (-1, 0)
- Right: (1, 0)
- Diagonals: (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)

Given the player's current position is (0, 3) and the goal is (4, 1), we'll start by exploring all possible moves from the current position.

### Step 1: Explore Possible Moves from (0, 3)

From (0, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up: (0, 2)
- Down: Not possible due to wall at (1, 3) and out of bounds at (0, 4) for a direct move, but we can consider moving down and then left/right if possible.
- Left: Not possible due to wall at (1, 2) and out of bounds at (-1, 3).
- Right: (1, 3) - This is a valid move as (1, 3) is an empty space.
- Diagonals: Only (1, 2) is a valid diagonal move, but it's blocked by a wall.

So, the only valid move from (0, 3) is to (1, 3).

### Next Move

The next move is to (1, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect this new position, and I'll proceed with the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.### Step 2: Explore Possible Moves from (1, 3)

From (1, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up: (1, 2) - Blocked by a wall.
- Down: (1, 4) - Blocked by a wall.
- Left: (0, 3) - Already visited, not a new move.
- Right: (2, 3) - Blocked by a wall.
- Diagonals: 
  - Up-Left: (0, 2) - Valid move.
  - Up-Right: (2, 2) - Valid move.
  - Down-Left: Not possible due to wall at (0, 4) and out of bounds.
  - Down-Right: Not possible due to wall at (2, 4).

So, the valid moves from (1, 3) are to (0, 2) and (2, 2).

### Next Move

Given the goal is (4, 1), moving to (2, 2) seems more promising as it moves us closer to the goal in terms of x-coordinate. Therefore, the next move is to (2, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect this new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.### Step 3: Explore Possible Moves from (2, 2)

From (2, 2), the possible moves are:
- Up: (2, 1) - Blocked by a wall.
- Down: (2, 3) - Blocked by a wall.
- Left: (1, 2) - Blocked by a wall.
- Right: (3, 2) - Blocked by a wall.
- Diagonals: 
  - Up-Left: (1, 1) - Blocked by a wall.
  - Up-Right: (3, 1) - Valid move.
  - Down-Left: (1, 3) - Already visited, not a new move.
  - Down-Right: (3, 3) - Blocked by a wall.

So, the only valid move from (2, 2) is to (3, 1).

### Next Move

Given the goal is (4, 1), moving to (3, 1) is a direct step towards the goal. Therefore, the next move is to (3, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect this new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.### Step 4: Explore Possible Moves from (3, 1)

From (3, 1), the possible moves are:
- Up: (3, 0) - Blocked by a wall.
- Down: (3, 2) - Blocked by a wall.
- Left: (2, 1) - Blocked by a wall.
- Right: (4, 1) - Valid move.
- Diagonals: 
  - Up-Left: (2, 0) - Blocked by a wall.
  - Up-Right: (4, 0) - Valid move.
  - Down-Left: (2, 2) - Already visited, not a new move.
  - Down-Right: (4, 2) - Valid move.

So, the valid moves from (3, 1) are to (4, 1), (4, 0), and (4, 2).

### Next Move

Given the goal is (4, 1), moving directly to (4, 1) is the most straightforward choice. Therefore, the next move is to (4, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect this new position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) General Shape of the Original Maze

After analyzing the original maze, it appears that the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) resembles a "Zigzag" or more specifically, a "Staircase" shape, given the diagonal and horizontal movements required to navigate from the player position to the goal.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "Staircase" shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 2)

This new maze maintains the same size and structure as the original, with a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G) that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces form a recognizable "Staircase" shape, similar to the original maze but with a distinct layout.
