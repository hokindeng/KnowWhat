You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or matrix, such as our maze. However, given the constraints of the problem and the format requested, I'll guide you through the thought process step by step, focusing on the immediate next move rather than the full path.

1. **Current Position**: The player is at (0, 3).
2. **Goal Position**: The goal is at (4, 1).
3. **Immediate Surroundings**: The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) to an adjacent empty space.

Given the current position (0, 3) and the goal (4, 1), the optimal first move would be to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. 

- **Up**: Not possible due to the wall at (1, 3) being too far to jump over directly.
- **Down**: Possible, but moving down does not bring us closer to the goal.
- **Left**: Not possible since it would move us away from the goal.
- **Right**: Possible and brings us closer to the goal. However, we need to consider diagonal moves as well.
- **Diagonals**: Moving diagonally down-right ((1, 2) is empty and closer to the goal) seems promising.

Considering the options, the best immediate move to make progress towards the goal while navigating through empty spaces would be to move diagonally down-right to (1, 2), as it brings us closer to the goal and avoids walls.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (1, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Path:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "Zigzag" or more specifically, a "Staircase" pattern, with a mix of horizontal and vertical segments that allow navigation from the player position to the goal.

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5), with empty spaces that form a similar "Staircase" pattern. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original and includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces.

**Walls:** (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 3)

**Empty:** (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)

**Player Position:** (0, 0)

**Goal:** (4, 2)

This new maze maintains the "Staircase" pattern of empty spaces, allowing for a navigable path from the player position to the goal while avoiding walls.
