You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or matrix, which is essentially what our maze is.

First, let's understand the maze layout and the rules:

- Walls are at positions: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
- Empty spaces (paths) are at positions: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- The player starts at position: (0, 3)
- The goal is at position: (4, 1)

Given the player's starting position (0, 3) and the goal (4, 1), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

Since we can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals), we'll consider all possible moves from the current position.

From the starting position (0, 3), the possible moves are limited by the walls and the maze boundaries. The immediate next steps could be moving down or diagonally down-left or down-right, considering the empty spaces available.

However, since the goal is to the right and down from the starting position, and considering the placement of walls, a reasonable first move would be to move down to position (1, 3), which is an empty space and avoids immediate collision with walls.

Therefore, my next move would be to position (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 3), we need to continue navigating towards the goal (4, 1). Given the walls and empty spaces, our next move should aim to move closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

Considering the maze layout, moving down to position (2, 3) is not possible due to the wall at (2, 3). However, we can move down-left to position (2, 2), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to position (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), we need to continue navigating towards the goal (4, 1). Given the walls and empty spaces, our next move should aim to move closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

Considering the maze layout, moving down to position (3, 2) is a possible move, as it is an empty space. Additionally, this move brings us closer to the goal and sets us up for potential future moves towards the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to position (3, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Zigzag" or more specifically, a "Staircase" shape, with a series of connected L-shapes.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "Staircase" shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 2)

This new maze has a similar "Staircase" shape formed by the empty spaces, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The player can navigate from the starting position (0, 0) to the goal (4, 2) through the empty spaces.
