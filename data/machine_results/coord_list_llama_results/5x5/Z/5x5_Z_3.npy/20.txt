You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I'm only asked for the next move, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best next step.

The current player position is (4, 4), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to (4, 4) and choose the one that seems to lead me closer to the goal.

The adjacent empty spaces to (4, 4) are (4, 3). Since (4, 3) is the only available option and it's closer to the goal, my next move will be to (4, 3).

Next move: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to (4, 3) and choose the one that seems to lead me closer to the goal.

The adjacent empty spaces to (4, 3) are (4, 2) and (4, 4). However, since I came from (4, 4) and moving back would not bring me closer to the goal, I will choose (4, 2) as my next move.

Next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to (4, 2) and choose the one that seems to lead me closer to the goal.

The adjacent empty spaces to (4, 2) are (4, 1), (4, 3), and (3, 2) (diagonal move). Since (3, 2) is closer to the goal and moving diagonally is allowed, I will choose (3, 2) as my next move.

Next move: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to (3, 2) and choose the one that seems to lead me closer to the goal.

However, I notice that there are no adjacent empty spaces to (3, 2) that I can move to directly. The goal (2, 3) is blocked by a wall at (3, 3). I need to find an alternative route.

Upon re-examining the maze, I notice that I can move to (1, 3) and then try to find a path to the goal from there. To get to (1, 3), I can move to (1, 2) first, which is an adjacent empty space to (3, 2) (diagonal move is not possible in this case, but I can move to (1, 2) and then to (1, 3)).

However, a more direct path would be to move to (1, 2) and then try to find a way to the goal from there.

Next move: (1, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form a zigzag shape, similar to the original maze.
