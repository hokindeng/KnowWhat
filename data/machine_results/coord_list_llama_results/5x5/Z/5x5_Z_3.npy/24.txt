You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I'm only asked for the next move, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best next step.

The current player position is (4, 4), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to (4, 4) and choose the one that seems to lead me closer to the goal.

The adjacent empty spaces to (4, 4) are (4, 3). Since (4, 3) is the only available option and it seems to lead me closer to the goal, I will choose it as my next move.

My next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to choose my next move. The adjacent empty spaces to (4, 3) are (4, 2) and (4, 4).

Since my goal is to reach (2, 3), I need to move towards the left and up. Between (4, 2) and (4, 4), moving to (4, 2) seems to lead me closer to the goal.

My next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to choose my next move. The adjacent empty spaces to (4, 2) are (4, 1), (4, 3), and (3, 2).

Since my goal is to reach (2, 3), I need to move towards the left and up. Between (4, 1), (4, 3), and (3, 2), moving to (3, 2) seems to lead me closer to the goal.

My next move is to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to choose my next move. However, there are no adjacent empty spaces to (3, 2) that I can move to directly.

Since my goal is to reach (2, 3), I need to move towards the left and up. I notice that I can move diagonally up and left to (2, 3), but it's not an empty space that I can directly move to from my current position because of the wall at (2, 2) and (3, 3) and other walls. However I can move diagonally up and left to (2, 3) if I can get around the wall at (2, 2) and (3, 3). 

I can move diagonally down and left to (2, 2) if I can get around the wall at (2, 2) but I can move diagonally down and left to (2, 1) if I can get around the wall at (2, 1) and (3, 1) but there is a wall at (2, 1) and (3, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag or staircase shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces in this maze also form a zigzag or staircase shape, similar to the original maze.
