You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I'm only asked for the next move, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best next step.

The current player position is (4, 4), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to (4, 4) and choose the one that seems to lead me closer to the goal.

The adjacent empty spaces to (4, 4) are (4, 3). Since (4, 3) is the only available option and it seems to be a step in the right direction (towards the goal), I will choose it as my next move.

My next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to determine my next move. The adjacent empty spaces to (4, 3) are (4, 2) and (4, 4).

Since my goal is to reach (2, 3), I need to move towards the left and up. Between the two options, (4, 2) seems to be a better choice as it allows me to move left and potentially sets me up for a future move up.

My next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to determine my next move. The adjacent empty spaces to (4, 2) are (4, 1), (4, 3), and (3, 2).

Since my goal is to reach (2, 3), I need to move up and slightly to the left. Among the available options, (3, 2) seems to be the best choice as it allows me to move up and gets me closer to the goal.

My next move is to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to determine my next move. However, I notice that there are no adjacent empty spaces to (3, 2) that I can move to directly.

Since I'm stuck, I will re-examine the maze and look for a possible path to the goal. I notice that I can move down to (4, 2) and then try to find an alternative path, but that would be moving away from the goal. Instead, I can try to move to (2, 3) indirectly by first moving to an empty space that is closer to the goal.

One possible option is to move to (1, 2) or (1, 3), but they are not adjacent to my current position. However, I can try to move to (1, 2) or (1, 3) in two steps by first moving to an empty space that is closer to them.

A possible next move is to (2, 2), but it's a wall. Another option is to move to (1, 2) in two steps, but I need to find an intermediate empty space. I can move to (2, 2) is not an option, so I need to find another intermediate empty space.

After re-examining the maze, I found that I can move to (1, 2) in two steps by first moving to (2, is not an option, so I need to find another intermediate empty space. A possible next move is to move down to (4, 2) and then try to find an alternative path, but that would be moving away from the goal.

Wait, I can move diagonally up-left to (2, 2) is not an option, but I can move diagonally up-left to (2, 1) is not an option, I can move diagonally up-left to (1, 1) and then try to move to (1, 2) and then (1, 3) and finally move to the goal.

My next move is to (1, 1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and has a zigzag shape formed by its empty spaces. However, it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
