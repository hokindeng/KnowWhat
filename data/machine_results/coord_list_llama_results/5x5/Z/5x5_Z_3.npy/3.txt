You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

The player is at the bottom-right corner of the maze, and the goal is located at the middle-left part of the maze.

My next move will be to move to an adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal. After examining the maze, I decide to move to:

(4, 3)

This move is valid since (4, 3) is an empty space, and it brings me closer to the goal.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will plan my next move accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Since the goal is directly above my current position, I will try to move up. However, I need to check if the space above me is empty or not.

After examining the maze, I see that (3, 3) is a wall, so I cannot move directly up. Instead, I will move to an adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal. I decide to move to:

(4, 2)

This move is valid since (4, 2) is an empty space, and it allows me to potentially move up or left in the next step, bringing me closer to the goal.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will plan my next move accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Since I am still below the goal, I will try to move up. I notice that (3, 2) is an empty space, which allows me to move closer to the goal.

I decide to move to:

(3, 2)

This move is valid since (3, 2) is an empty space, and it brings me closer to the goal.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will plan my next move accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Since I am below and to the right of the goal, I will try to move up and left. However, I notice that (2, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move directly up and left.

Instead, I will move to an adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal. I decide to move to:

(2 is blocked, so I will move left one space and then reassess)
(3 is not a viable row to be in to get to the goal, so I will move up one space and then reassess is also not an option)
 Move left is not an option, move up is not an option, move right is an option but does not bring me closer to the goal, move down is an option but does not bring me closer to the goal. 
(2, 2) is a wall, (2, 1) is a wall, (3, 1) is a wall, (3, 3) is a wall, (2, 4) is a wall, 
(1, 3) is empty and is one space away from the goal. 
 Move to (2 is not an option, move to 1 is an option)
 Move to (1, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "staircase" or a "zigzag" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same staircase or zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, and it includes a valid path from the player position to the goal position that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a staircase or zigzag shape, similar to the original maze. However, the new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze.
