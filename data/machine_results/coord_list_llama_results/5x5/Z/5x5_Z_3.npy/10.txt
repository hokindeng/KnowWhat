You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I'm only asked for the next move, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best next step.

The current player position is (4, 4), and the goal is (2, 3). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to (4, 4) and choose the one that seems to lead me closer to the goal.

The adjacent empty spaces to (4, 4) are (4, 3). Since (4, 3) is closer to the goal and is an empty space, my next move will be to (4, 3).

Next move: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to (4, 3) and choose the one that seems to lead me closer to the goal.

The adjacent empty spaces to (4, 3) are (4, 2) and (4, 4). However, since I came from (4, 4) and moving back would not bring me closer to the goal, I will consider (4, 2) as a potential next step.

Additionally, I will also consider (3, 2) as a potential next step, as it is diagonally adjacent to (4, 3) and seems to be a good candidate to move closer to the goal.

Between (4, 2) and (3, 2), I will choose (3, 2) as my next move, as it appears to be a more direct path towards the goal.

Next move: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to (3, 2) and choose the one that seems to lead me closer to the goal.

The adjacent empty spaces to (3, 2) are (2 is blocked by a wall, so I'll look at other options) (4, 2), (3 is blocked by a wall to the left and right, and the goal is up and to the left, so I'll look diagonally up-left), (2, 3) is not directly accessible, but (1, 3) and (1, 2) are potential candidates.

However, I can also consider (2, 3) as a potential next step by going diagonally up-left from (3, 2), but since it's the goal, I'll try to move directly to it if possible.

Unfortunately, I can't move directly to (2, 3) because it's not adjacent to (3, 2). So, I will choose (1, 3) or (1, 2) as a stepping stone to get closer to the goal.

Between (1, 3) and (1, 2), I will choose (1, 3) as my next move, as it appears to be a more direct path towards the goal.

However, I can also try to move to (2, 3) if I can find a way to get around the wall at (2, 2). But for now, I will choose (1, 3) as my next move.

Next move: (1, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces in this maze also form a zigzag shape, similar to the original maze.
