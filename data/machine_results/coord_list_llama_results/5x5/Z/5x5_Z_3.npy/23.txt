You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Since I can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position, I will examine the neighboring empty spaces.

The neighboring empty spaces of (4, 4) are:
(4, 3)

I will move to (4, 3) as it is the only available option.

Next move: (4, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position. I will then analyze the new situation and make the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

The neighboring empty spaces of (4, 3) are:
(4, 2), (4, 4)

Since I need to move closer to the goal, I will choose the space that is more likely to lead me to the goal. In this case, I will move to (4, 2) as it is slightly closer to the goal.

Next move: (4, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position. I will then analyze the new situation and make the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

The neighboring empty spaces of (4, 2) are:
(4, 1), (4, 3), (3, 2)

Since I need to move closer to the goal, I will choose the space that is more likely to lead me to the goal. In this case, I will move to (3, 2) as it is closer to the goal and provides a potential path to reach the goal.

Next move: (3, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position. I will then analyze the new situation and make the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

The neighboring empty spaces of (3, 2) are:
(2 is blocked by a wall, so I'll look at other options)
(4, 2), (1 is not directly adjacent, but I can try to move diagonally to) (2 is blocked, but) (1, 3) and other spaces are not directly adjacent, however, another option is to move diagonally to (2 is blocked, but I can try) (1 is not directly adjacent to the right, but I can try) (no other option to the right), (no option down), (no option left), (1, 2) 

Since I need to move closer to the goal, I will choose the space that is more likely to lead me to the goal. In this case, I will move to (1, 3) as it is closer to the goal and provides a potential path to reach the goal, however, I can also try (1, 2) and try to move up and right next.

Next move: (1, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position. I will then analyze the new situation and make the next move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form a zigzag shape, similar to the original maze.
