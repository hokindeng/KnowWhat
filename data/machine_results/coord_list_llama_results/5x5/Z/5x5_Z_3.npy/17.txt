You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (4, 4), and the adjacent empty spaces are (4, 3).

My next move will be to (4, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. The adjacent empty spaces are (4, 2) and (4, 4).

Since my goal is to move towards the goal position (2, 3), I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move to (4, 2).

My next move will be to (4, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. The adjacent empty spaces are (4, 1), (4, 3), and (3, 2).

Since my goal is to move towards the goal position (2, 3), I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move to (3, 2).

My next move will be to (3, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. However, there are no adjacent empty spaces that I can move to directly.

Since I am blocked by walls and there are no adjacent empty spaces, I will need to backtrack to a previous position that has adjacent empty spaces that can lead me to the goal.

In this case, I will move back to (4, 2).

My next move will be to (4, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.



However, I noticed that I can also try to move to (1, 2) or (1, 3) and then try to reach the goal from there. If I can move to (1, 3), I might be able to reach the goal (2, 3) from there.

Let me try to move to (1, 3) or a position that can lead me to (1, 3).

Wait, I can move to (1, 2) and then to (1, 3) and then try to reach the goal.

My next move will be to (1, 2) and then I will try to move to (1, 3) and then to the goal.

However, I can only make one move at a time.

My next move will be to (1, 2), but I am not adjacent to (1, 2). I will need to move to a position that is adjacent to (1, 2) or (1, 3).

In this case, I will move to (4, 1).

My next move will be to (4, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 1), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. The adjacent empty space is (4, 2), but I already tried moving in that direction.

However, I also notice that I can move to (1, 1), which is adjacent to (1, 2) and (1, 3), and those positions can potentially lead me to the goal.

My next move will be to (1, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag or staircase shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as a zigzag or staircase shape.
