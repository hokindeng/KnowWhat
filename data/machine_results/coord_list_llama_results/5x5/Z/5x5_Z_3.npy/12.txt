You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

The player is at the bottom-right corner of the maze, and the goal is located at the middle-left part of the maze.

My next move will be to move to an adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal. After examining the empty spaces, I decide to move to:

(4, 3)

This move is a step to the left, which brings me closer to the goal and is a valid move since (4, 3) is an empty space.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I'll be ready to make the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Since the goal is directly above my current position, I will try to move up. However, I need to check if the space above me is empty. Unfortunately, (3, 3) is a wall, so I cannot move directly up.

Instead, I will move to an adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal. I decide to move to:

(4, 2)

This move is a step to the left, which brings me closer to a potential path to the goal and is a valid move since (4, 2) is an empty space.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I'll be ready to make the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Since I'm trying to reach the goal, which is above and to the right of my current position, I will try to move up. However, I need to check if the space above me is empty. Fortunately, (3, 2) is an empty space, so I can move up.

I decide to move to:

(3, 2)

This move is a step up, which brings me closer to the goal and is a valid move since (3, 2) is an empty space.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I'll be ready to make the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Since I'm trying to reach the goal, which is above and to the right of my current position, I will try to move up and right. However, I need to check if the space above and right of me is empty. Unfortunately, (2, 2) is a wall, and (3, 3) is also a wall, so I cannot move directly up or right.

Instead, I will move to an adjacent empty space that brings me closer to the goal. I decide to move to:

(2, 3) is not reachable directly, but I can try to move to a space that will allow me to reach it later. I notice that (2, 3) is adjacent to (1, 3), which is an empty space. To reach (1, 3), I can move to (2, 2) is a wall, but (2, 1) is not an option, so I will move down is not an option, I will try to move left and then up.

However I can move diagonally up and left to (2, 2) is a wall so I will move to (2, 1) is not an option so I move to 

(1, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, and it includes a valid path from the player position to the goal position that can be reached through the empty spaces. The general shape formed by the empty spaces is still a zigzag or staircase shape, but the maze is not an identical copy of the original.
