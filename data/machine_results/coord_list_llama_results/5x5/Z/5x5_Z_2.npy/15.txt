You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (0, 2), and the adjacent empty spaces are:

* (0, 1)
* (0, 3)
* (1, 2)

Since the goal position is (2, 1), I will move towards the right and down to get closer to the goal. The next move will be to the position (1, 2), as it is the closest empty space to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. However, I notice that there are no adjacent empty spaces to the right or down, as those positions are blocked by walls.

The adjacent empty spaces are:

* (0, 2)
* (0, 1)
* (0, 3)

Since I need to move closer to the goal position (2, 1), I will try to move around the wall. I will move up and left to position (0, 2), and then I can reassess the situation.

However, I notice that I was already at position (0, 2) previously, and moving back to it would not bring me closer to the goal. Instead, I will try to move around the wall by going up and left to position (0, 1), and then I can try to find a path to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0, 1), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. The adjacent empty spaces are:

* (0, 0)
* (0, 2)

Since I need to move closer to the goal position (2, 1), I will try to move down. However, the positions below me are blocked by walls. I will try to move around the wall by going down and right, but the position (1, 1) is also blocked by a wall.

I will move to the position (0, 0), as it is the only available empty space that might allow me to find a path to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0, 0), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. The adjacent empty space is:

* (0, 1)

However, I was already at position (0, 1) previously, and moving back to it would not bring me closer to the goal. I will try to find another path.

I notice that the position (3, 0) is an empty space, and it might allow me to find a path to the goal. I will move to the position (3, 0).

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, and it includes a valid path from the player position to the goal position that can be reached through the empty spaces. The general shape formed by the empty spaces is still a zigzag or staircase shape, but the maze is not an identical copy of the original.
