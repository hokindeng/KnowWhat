You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 2). The goal is (2, 1). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: Not possible, as it's out of bounds.
- Down: (1, 2) is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 1) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 3) is an empty space.
- Diagonals: Not considered in this initial step, as the primary goal is to move closer to the goal.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), the best possible move would be to move down to (1, 2), as it brings us closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (1, 2). The goal is (2, 1). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: (0, 2) is an empty space, but it's not closer to the goal.
- Down: Not possible, as (2, 2) is a wall.
- Left: Not possible, as (1, 1) is a wall.
- Right: Not possible, as (1, 3) is a wall.
- Diagonals: (2, 1) is the goal, but it's not directly accessible. However, I can try to move diagonally to (0, 1) or (2, 3) is not possible as it is a wall, but I can try (0, 3).

Considering the goal position (2, 1), the best possible move would be to move up to (0, 2) and then try to find an alternative path or move diagonally to (0, 1) and then try to find a path to the goal.

However, I noticed that moving diagonally to (0, 1) and then trying to move to the goal might be a better option in the long run. But since I can move diagonally to (0, 1) directly, that would be the best move.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 1). The goal is (2, 1). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: Not possible, as it's out of bounds.
- Down: Not possible, as (1, 1) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 0) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 2) is an empty space.
- Diagonals: Not possible, as the goal is blocked by a wall from this position.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), I need to find a way to move down. However, the direct path is blocked by a wall. I will try to move right to (0, 2) and then try to find a path to move down.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 2). The goal is (2, 1). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: Not possible, as it's out of bounds.
- Down: (1, 2) is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 1) is an empty space, but it's not closer to the goal.
- Right: (0, 3) is an empty space.
- Diagonals: Not possible, as the goal is blocked by a wall from this position.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), I need to find a way to move down and then left. I will try to move down to (1, 2) and then try to find a path to move left.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (1, 2). The goal is (2, 1). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: (0, 2) is an empty space, but it's not closer to the goal.
- Down: Not possible, as (2, 2) is a wall.
- Left: Not possible, as (1, 1) is a wall.
- Right: Not possible, as (1, 3) is a wall.
- Diagonals: (2, 1) is the goal, but I need to make sure I can move there.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), I will try to move diagonally to the goal.

However, I noticed that I can move diagonally to (0, 1) or (2, 3) is not possible as it is a wall, but I can try (0, 3) or try to move diagonally to the goal (2, 1). Since moving diagonally to the goal is the most direct path, I will try that.

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a zigzag or staircase shape, similar to the original maze.
