You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current position and the available empty spaces.

The current player position is (0, 2). The available empty spaces adjacent to the current position are:

* (0, 1)
* (0, 3)
* (1, 2)

Since the goal position is (2, 1), I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move to (0, 1), as it is the closest empty space to the goal.

My next move is: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 1), I will analyze the available empty spaces adjacent to the current position:

* (0, 0)
* (0, 2)
* (1, 2)

Since the goal position is (2, 1), I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move to (0, 2), as it is the closest empty space to the goal in the vertical direction, but I will actually move to (1, 2) because it is the closest empty space to the goal in the horizontal direction.

However, I will move to (0, 0) because moving to (1, 2) would put me in a position where I would be forced to move away from the goal in the next step.

My next move is: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 0), I will analyze the available empty spaces adjacent to the current position:

* (0, 1)

Since the goal position is (2, 1), I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move to (0, 1), as it is the only available empty space adjacent to the current position.

However, I notice that I was already in this position before, and it didn't bring me closer to the goal. I will re-evaluate the maze and look for a different path.

A possible alternative is to move to (3, 0), which is not adjacent to the current position, but it's a possible path to the goal. To get to (3, 0), I need to move to (3, 0) through the empty space (3, 0) is not adjacent to the current position, I will try to get closer to it. 

My next move is: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 1), I will analyze the available empty spaces adjacent to the current position:

* (0, 0)
* (0, 2)

Since the goal position is (2, 1), I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move to (0, 2), as it is the closest empty space to the goal in the vertical direction.

However, I notice that I was already in a similar situation before, and moving up didn't bring me closer to the goal. I will re-evaluate the maze and look for a different path.

A possible alternative is to move down to (3, 1), which is closer to the goal. To get to (3, 1), I need to move down through the empty space (3, 0) or (3, 1). Since I am at (0, 1), I will try to get closer to (3, 1) by moving to (3, 0) first.

But (3, 0) is not adjacent to the current position, I will try to get closer to it. 

My next move is: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 2), I will analyze the available empty spaces adjacent to the current position:

* (0, 1)
* (0, 3)
* (1, 2)

Since the goal position is (2, 1), I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move to (1, 2), as it is the closest empty space to the goal in the horizontal direction.

My next move is: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 2), I will analyze the available empty spaces adjacent to the current position:

* (0, 2)
* (0, 3)
* (3, 2)
* (3, 3)
* (3, 1)
* (3, 0)

However, none of these empty spaces are directly adjacent to the current position in the direction of the goal (2, 1). But I can move diagonally to (3, 1) or move to (3, 2) or (3, 3) or (3, 0) and then try to get closer to the goal.

However, I can move to (3, 1) directly, which is closer to the goal.

My next move is: (3, 1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as a zigzag or staircase shape.
