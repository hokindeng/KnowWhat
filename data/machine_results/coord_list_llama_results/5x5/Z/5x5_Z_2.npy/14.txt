You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (0, 2), and the adjacent empty spaces are:

* (0, 1)
* (0, 3)
* (1, 2)

Since the goal position is (2, 1), I will move towards the right and down to get closer to the goal. The next move will be to the position (1, 2), as it is the closest empty space to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. However, I notice that there are no adjacent empty spaces to the right or down, as those positions are occupied by walls.

The adjacent empty spaces are:

* (0, 2)
* (0, 1)
* (0, 3)

Since the goal position is (2, 1), I need to move down and to the right. However, I'm blocked by walls. I will move down and to the left to position (0, 1), which will give me more options for the next move.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 1), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. The adjacent empty spaces are:

* (0, 0)
* (0, 2)

Since the goal position is (2, 1), I need to move down. However, I'm blocked by a wall at (1, 1). I will move down and to the right is not possible, so I will move down and to the left is not possible either. I will move to the right to position (0, 2) and then I will try to find a way to move down.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. The adjacent empty spaces are:

* (0, 1)
* (0, 3)
* (1, 2)

Since the goal position is (2, 1), I need to move down. I will move to the position (1, 2), which I have already visited before. However, this time I will try to find a different path to move down.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. However, I notice that there are no adjacent empty spaces to the right or down, as those positions are occupied by walls.

The adjacent empty spaces are:

* (0, 2)
* (0, 1)
* (0, 3)

However, I've already explored those positions and didn't find a way to move down. I will try to move to a different part of the maze. I notice that there are empty spaces at the bottom left of the maze, and I will try to move towards them.

I will move to the position (0, 3), and then I will try to find a way to move down.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. The adjacent empty spaces are:

* (0, 2)

However, I've already explored that position and didn't find a way to move down. I notice that there are empty spaces at the bottom left of the maze, and I will try to move towards them.

I will move to the position (3, 3), which is not adjacent to my current position, but I can move diagonally to (3, 3) is not possible, I will move to (3, 2) is not possible, I will move to (3, 1) is not possible, I will move to (3, 0) is not possible from my current position, but I can move to a position that will allow me to move to those positions later.

I will move to the position that will allow me to move down, I will move to the left to position (0, 0) and then I will try to find a way to move down.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same U-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original maze, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as a U-shape or a horseshoe shape.
