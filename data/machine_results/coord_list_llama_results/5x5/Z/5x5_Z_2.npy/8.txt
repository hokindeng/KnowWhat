You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (0, 2), and the adjacent empty spaces are (0, 1) and (0, 3).

Since the goal position is (2, 1), I will move towards the right and down to get closer to the goal. The next move will be to the position (0, 3), as it is the closest empty space that brings me closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. The available options are (0, 2) and (1, 2) and (0, 1) and none of the other adjacent spaces, as they are either walls or outside the maze.

Since the goal position is (2, 1), I will move towards the right and down to get closer to the goal. The next move will be to the position (1, 2), as it is the closest empty space that brings me closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. However, I notice that there are no adjacent empty spaces that I can move to directly.

But I can move diagonally to the position (2, 1) is not possible because there is a wall at (2, 2) and (1, 1) but I can move diagonally to the position (0, 1) or I can move to the position (0, 3) or (0, 2) but none of these moves bring me closer to the goal.

However I can see that there is an empty space at (3, 1) that is close to the goal, and I can try to move towards it.

Since I am at (1, 2) I can move to (0, 2) or (0, 3) or (0, 1) but none of these moves bring me closer to the goal but if I move to (0, 1) I can then move to (3, 1) in the following moves.

However a better option would be to move to (0, 2) and then to (3, 2) and then to (3, 1) and then to (2, 1).

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. The available options are (0, 1) and (0, 3) and (1, 2).

However, I want to move towards the goal position (2, 1). Since I am at (0, 2) I can move to (3, 2) in the following moves.

The next move will be to the position (3, 2) is not possible because it is not adjacent, but I can move to (3, 0) and then to (3, 2) or I can move to (0, 1) and then to (3, 1) but a better option would be to move to (0, 1) and then to (3, 1).

However I can also move to (3, 0) and then to (3, 1) and then to (2, 1).

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0, 1), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces. The available options are (0, 0) and (0, 2).

However, I want to move towards the goal position (2, 1). Since I am at (0, 1) I can move to (3, 1) in the following moves.

The next move will be to the position (3, 0) because it is the closest empty space that brings me closer to the goal position (3, 1) and then I can move to (3, 1) and then to (2, 1).

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 2)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original maze, and the empty spaces form a zigzag shape that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal position. The maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it has a similar shape and structure.
