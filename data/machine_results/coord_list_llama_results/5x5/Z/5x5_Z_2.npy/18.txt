You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I don't have the capability to visually see the maze or interact with it in real-time, I will provide a step-by-step solution based on the given information.

First, I will analyze the current player position and the surrounding empty spaces. The player is at (0, 2), and the adjacent empty spaces are (0, 1) and (0, 3).

Since the goal position is (2, 1), I will try to move in a direction that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, I will move to (0, 1), as it is the closest empty space to the goal.

My next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0, 1), I will analyze the surrounding empty spaces. The adjacent empty spaces are (0, 0) and (0, 2).

Since the goal position is (2, 1), I need to move in a direction that brings me closer to the goal. However, there are walls blocking my direct path to the goal. I will try to move around the walls to get closer to the goal.

In this case, I will move to (0, 0), as it is the closest empty space that allows me to potentially move around the walls and get closer to the goal.

My next move is to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0, 0), I will analyze the surrounding empty spaces. The adjacent empty space is (0, 1).

However, I've already been to (0, 1) before, and it didn't bring me closer to the goal. I need to explore other options.

I notice that there is an empty space at (3, 0) that is not blocked by walls. I can try to move towards that space and see if it brings me closer to the goal.

My next move is to (3, 0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a zigzag shape that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal position. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape and structure.
