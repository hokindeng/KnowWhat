You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I need to provide the next move only, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 2). The goal is (2, 1). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: Not possible, as it's out of bounds.
- Down: (1, 2) is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 1) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 3) is an empty space.
- Diagonals: Not possible, as they are either out of bounds or walls.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), the best possible move would be to move down to (1, 2), as it brings us closer to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (1, 2). The goal is (2, 1). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: (0, 2) is an empty space, but it's not closer to the goal.
- Down: Not possible, as it's a wall.
- Left: Not possible, as it's a wall.
- Right: Not possible, as it's a wall.
- Diagonals: (2, 1) is the goal, but it's not directly reachable. However, I can try to move diagonally to (2, 1), but since it's not allowed to move through walls, I will look for an alternative. (0, 1) is not closer to the goal. (2, 3) is not an empty space.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), I need to find a way to get closer to it. Since I'm blocked by walls, I will try to move up to (0, 2) and then find a way to move right.

However, a better option would be to move diagonally up-left to (0, 1), which will give me more possibilities for the next move.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 1). The goal is (2, 1). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: Not possible, as it's out of bounds.
- Down: Not possible, as it's a wall.
- Left: (0, 0) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 2) is an empty space.
- Diagonals: Not possible, as they are either out of bounds or walls.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), I need to find a way to get closer to it. Since I'm blocked by walls, I will try to move right to (0, 2) and then find a way to move down.

However, moving right to (0, 2) doesn't bring me closer to the goal. A better option would be to move right to (0, 2) and then try to find a way to move down, but since I've already been at (1, 2) and it didn't lead me to the goal, I will try to find an alternative.

Moving left to (0, 0) is not a good option either, as it takes me further away from the goal.

Since I don't have a clear path to the goal, I will try to move right to (0, 2) and then re-evaluate the situation.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 2). The goal is (2, 1). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: Not possible, as it's out of bounds.
- Down: (1, 2) is an empty space, but I've already been there and it didn't lead me to the goal.
- Left: (0, 1) is an empty space, but it's not closer to the goal.
- Right: (0, 3) is an empty space.
- Diagonals: Not possible, as they are either out of bounds or walls.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), I need to find a way to get closer to it. Since I'm blocked by walls, I will try to move right to (0, 3) and then find a way to move down.

However, moving right to (0, 3) doesn't bring me closer to the goal. But I will try to move right to (0, 3) and then re-evaluate the situation.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation and choose the best possible move.

The current player position is (0, 3). The goal is (2, 1). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up: Not possible, as it's out of bounds.
- Down: Not possible, as it's a wall.
- Left: (0, 2) is an empty space.
- Right: Not possible, as it's a wall.
- Diagonals: Not possible, as they are either out of bounds or walls.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), I need to find a way to get closer to it. Since I'm blocked by walls, I will try to move left to (0, 2) and then find a way to move down.

However, I've already been at (0, 2) and it didn't lead me to the goal. I need to re-evaluate the situation.

Upon re-evaluation, I notice that I've been moving in a loop, and I need to find a new path. I will try to move to a different part of the maze.

I will move left to (0, 2), and then try to find a way to move to the bottom part of the maze.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

- Left: (0, 1) is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 3) is an empty space.
- Diagonals: Not possible, as they are either out of bounds or walls.

Considering the goal position (2, 1), I need to find a way to get closer to it. Since I'm blocked by walls, I will try to move to a different part of the maze.

I notice that the bottom part of the maze has some empty spaces that might lead me to the goal. I will try to move to the bottom part of the maze.

To do this, I will move left to (0, 1), and then try to find a way to move down to the bottom part of the maze.

However, I've already been at (0, 1) and it didn't lead me to the goal. I need to re-evaluate the situation.

Upon re-evaluation, I notice that I can move left to (0, 1) and then try to move down to (3, 1), which is closer to the goal.

But I can also try to move left to (0, 0) and then try to move down to (3, 0), which might also lead me to the goal.

I will move left to (0, 1) and then re-evaluate the situation.

The coordinates of my next move are: (0, 1)

To do this, I will move right to (0, 1), but I've already been there and it didn't lead me to the goal. However, I can try to move down to the bottom part of the maze from a different position.

I will move right to (0, 1) and then try to find a way to move down to (3, 1), but I've already tried that path. Instead, I will try to move down to (3, 0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape, but more specifically, it can be described as a "disconnected L-shape" or a "broken L-shape". However, if I had to choose a more general shape, I would say that the empty spaces form a "U-shape" or a " horseshoe shape", considering the overall structure of the maze.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "U-shape" or "horseshoe shape":

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 3)

Note that this new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but it has the same size and a similar shape formed by its empty spaces. The player can reach the goal by navigating through the empty spaces.
