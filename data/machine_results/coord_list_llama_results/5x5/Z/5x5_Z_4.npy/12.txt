You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will analyze the given information and plan a step-by-step path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

First, I will examine the current player position and the surrounding empty spaces. The player is at (3, 4), and the adjacent empty spaces are (3, 3).

My next move will be to (3, 3), as it is the only available empty space adjacent to the current player position.

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

From the current player position (3, 3), I can move to the adjacent empty spaces. The available options are (3, 2) and (3, 4).

Since my goal is to reach (2, 2), I will move closer to the goal by choosing the empty space that reduces the distance between the player position and the goal. In this case, I will move to (3, 2).

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the updated maze and plan my next move.

From the current player position (3, 2), I can see that the goal (2, 2) is just one step away, diagonally up and to the left. However, I need to check if there are any walls or obstacles in the way.

Since there are no walls or obstacles between (3, 2) and (2, 2), I can move directly to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (2, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape, but more specifically, it resembles a " diagonal staircase" or a " diagonal zigzag" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar diagonal zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G, and is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form a diagonal zigzag shape, similar to the original maze.
