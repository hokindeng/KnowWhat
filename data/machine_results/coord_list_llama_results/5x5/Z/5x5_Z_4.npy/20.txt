You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since I'm only asked for the next move, I will analyze the current situation and choose the best next step.

The current player position is (3, 4), and the goal is (2, 2). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent empty spaces to (3, 4) are:
- (3, 3) (since (3, 3) is in the list of empty spaces)

Moving to (3, 3) seems like the best next step, as it gets closer to the goal and is the only available empty space adjacent to the current position.

My next move is to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent empty spaces to (3, 3) are:
- (3, 2) (since (3, 2) is in the list of empty spaces)
- (3, 4) (since (3, 4) is in the list of empty spaces, but I just came from there, so I'll ignore it for now)

Moving to (3, 2) seems like the best next step, as it gets closer to the goal.

My next move is to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

However, I notice that the goal (2, 2) is just one step away from my current position, diagonally up and to the left.

My next move is to (2, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a zigzag shape that allows the player to navigate from the starting position to the goal. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape and structure.
