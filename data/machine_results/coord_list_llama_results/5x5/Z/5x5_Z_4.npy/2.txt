You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

The player is at position (3, 4), and the goal is at position (2, 2). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the player position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
(3, 3)

Since the goal is not adjacent to the player position, I will move to the adjacent empty space that is closest to the goal.

My next move is to position (3, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

The player is at position (3, 3), and the goal is at position (2, 2). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the player position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
(3, 2), (3, 4)

Since the goal is not adjacent to the player position, I will move to the adjacent empty space that is closest to the goal.

My next move is to position (3, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

The player is at position (3, 2), and the goal is at position (2, 2). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the player position.

The adjacent empty spaces are:
(3, 1), (3, 3)

However, I notice that the goal is directly above the player position, and there is no wall blocking the way.

My next move is to position (2, 2), which is the goal position.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze, and it includes a valid path from the player position to the goal position that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a zigzag or staircase shape.
