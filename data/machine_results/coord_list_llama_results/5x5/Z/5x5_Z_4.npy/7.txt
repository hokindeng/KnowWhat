You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will examine the current player position and the adjacent empty spaces. The player position is (3, 4), and the adjacent empty spaces are:

* (3, 3)
* (2, 3) is not empty, it's a wall
* (4, 3) is not empty, it's a wall
* (3, 5) is out of bounds
* (2, 4) is not empty, it's a wall
* (4, 4) is not empty, it's a wall
* (3, 3) is the only valid move

My next move will be to (3, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 3), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

* (3, 2)
* (3, 4)
* (2, 3) is not empty, it's a wall
* (4, 3) is not empty, it's a wall
* (2, 2) is not directly accessible, it's blocked by a wall
* (3, 2) and (3, 4) are the only valid moves

Since my goal is to reach (2, 2), I will try to get closer to it. Moving to (3, 2) seems like a good option, as it brings me closer to the goal.

My next move will be to (3, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 2), I will examine the adjacent empty spaces:

* (3, 1)
* (3, 3)
* (2, 2) is the goal, but I need to check if I can move diagonally to it
* (4, 2) is not empty, it's a wall
* (2, 1) is not empty, it's a wall
* (2, 3) is not empty, it's a wall

Since my goal is to reach (2, 2), I will try to move diagonally to it. However, I need to make sure that the diagonal move is valid. In this case, I can move diagonally to (2, 2) because it is an empty space.

My next move will be to (2, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position. 

Note: If diagonal moves are not allowed, I would move to (3, 1) or (3, 3) and try to find an alternative path to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Wait, it seems like the maze state has not been updated correctly. According to our previous conversation, I had moved to (3, 2) and then to (2, 2), which is the goal position. However, the current state of the maze shows that I am back at (3, 3), which is not correct.

If I am indeed at (2, 2), then I have already reached the goal and there is no need for further moves. If I am not at (2, 2), then I would like to clarify the correct state of the maze before making my next move.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a zigzag shape that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal position. The maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares the same general shape and structure.
