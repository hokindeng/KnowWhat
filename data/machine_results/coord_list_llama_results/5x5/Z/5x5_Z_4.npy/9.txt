You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

The player is currently at position (3, 4), and the goal is at position (2, 2). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the player position.

The adjacent empty spaces to (3, 4) are:

* (3, 3)

Since (3, 3) is the only adjacent empty space, my next move will be to (3, 3).

Next move: (3, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

The player is currently at position (3, 3), and the goal is at position (2, 2). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the player position.

The adjacent empty spaces to (3, 3) are:

* (3, 2)
* (3, 4)
* (3, 1) and others that are not directly adjacent but are within the allowed diagonal movement, however, I will prioritize the directly adjacent spaces first.

Since (3, 2) is directly adjacent to the goal column and closer to the goal, my next move will be to (3, 2).

Next move: (3, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current situation:

Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

The player is currently at position (3, 2), and the goal is at position (2, 2). I will examine the adjacent empty spaces to the player position.

Since the goal is directly above the player position, and there are no walls in between, my next move will be to the goal position (2, 2).

However, I notice that (2, 2) is not explicitly listed as an empty space. I will assume that it is indeed an empty space, as it is the goal position.

Next move: (2, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position. If (2, 2) is not an empty space, please let me know and I will re-evaluate the situation.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag or staircase shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form a zigzag or staircase shape. The player can navigate from the starting position to the goal position through the empty spaces. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original, but it shares a similar shape and structure.
