You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move towards the goal position (G) at (1, 0) from the current player position (P) at (1, 3).

First, let's analyze the maze:

- The player is at (1, 3).
- The goal is at (1, 0).
- The walls and empty spaces are as given.

Since the goal is directly above the player and there are no walls blocking the direct path upwards, the most straightforward move would be to move up. However, we need to check if the space directly above the player is empty.

Given the empty spaces listed, (1, 2) is an empty space directly above (1, 3), and (1, 1) is also empty, which is directly above (1, 2). This means we can move up towards the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 2), as it is an empty space directly above the current position and brings us closer to the goal.

Please update the maze with my new position at (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1, 2), I'll analyze the maze again to determine my next move.

Since my goal is to reach (1, 0) and I'm currently at (1, 2), the most direct path would be to move up. However, I need to check if the space directly above me is empty.

According to the updated maze, (1, 1) is an empty space directly above my current position. Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 1), as it brings me closer to the goal and is an empty space.

Please update the maze with my new position at (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1, 1), I'll analyze the maze again to determine my next move.

Since my goal is to reach (1, 0) and I'm currently at (1, 1), the most direct path would be to move up. However, I need to check if the space directly above me is empty.

Unfortunately, the space directly above me, (1, 0), is actually the goal position, but it's also blocked by a wall at (0, 0) and (0, 1) doesn't allow me to move directly up. However, I can see that (1, 0) is not blocked by a wall on the left or right side of the goal, but rather only on the top side. Since I can move diagonally, I can move to the goal position (1, 0) from my current position (1, 1).

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 0), as it is the goal position and I can reach it diagonally from my current position.

Please update the maze with my new position at (1, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (3, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces form an L-shape, similar to the original maze, but with a different orientation and position.
