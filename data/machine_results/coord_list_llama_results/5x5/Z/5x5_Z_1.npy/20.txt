You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move towards the goal position (G) at (1, 0) from the current player position (P) at (1, 3).

First, let's analyze the maze:

- The player is at (1, 3).
- The goal is at (1, 0).
- The direct path to the goal is blocked by walls at (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), and (0, 4), and also at (1, 4) and (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 4).

Given the constraints and the layout, the most direct path to the goal while avoiding walls would involve moving down and then left or right to navigate around the walls. However, since we can move diagonally and the goal is directly above the player but blocked by walls to the left, we should aim to move right and then up.

The first move should be to an empty space that brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls. Since moving directly up is blocked, and moving left is also blocked due to the wall at (0, 3), the best initial move is to the right, to position (2, 3), and then we can reassess the path from there.

However, considering the layout and the goal to move towards (1, 0), and given that we can move diagonally, a more efficient first step considering the constraints and aiming to navigate around the walls effectively would be to move diagonally down-right to (2, 2), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal while navigating around the wall at (2, 3).

So, the next move should be to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (2, 2), the next move should aim to bring us closer to the goal at (1, 0) while navigating around the walls.

Since we are at (2, 2) and the goal is at (1, 0), moving up-left would be the most direct approach. However, we need to consider the walls and empty spaces. Moving directly up-left is not possible due to the wall at (2, 1), but we can move up to (2, 1) is not possible, so we should move left to (1, 2) which is an empty space.

So, the next move should be to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (1, 2), the next move should aim to bring us closer to the goal at (1, 0) while navigating around the walls.

Since we are at (1, 2) and the goal is at (1, 0), moving up is the most direct approach. However, we need to consider the walls and empty spaces. Moving directly up to (1, 1) is possible since it is an empty space.

So, the next move should be to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (1, 1), the next move should aim to bring us closer to the goal at (1, 0) while navigating around the walls.

Since we are at (1, 1) and the goal is at (1, 0), moving up is the most direct approach. However, we need to consider the walls and empty spaces. Unfortunately, moving directly up to (1, 0) is not possible since it is blocked by a wall at (0, 0) and (1, 0) is not an empty space.

However, I noticed that I made an incorrect assumption earlier. Since (1, 0) is the goal, it should be an empty space. Given the current state, I should have reached the goal already.

So, the next move should be to (1, 0), which is the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form an L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

This new maze has an L-shaped path from the player position (1, 1) to the goal (0, 4), navigating through the empty spaces.
