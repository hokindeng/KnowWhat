You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we'll adapt our approach to accommodate these requirements.

Given the current player position (P) is at (1, 3) and the goal (G) is at (1, 0), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

First, let's analyze the maze and the possible moves from the current position:

- Current Position: (1, 3)
- Goal Position: (1, 0)

From (1, 3), considering the empty spaces and the goal's direction, the most direct move towards the goal while avoiding walls would be to move up. However, since we can move diagonally and the goal is directly above us but one column to the left, we should aim to move in a way that gets us closer to the goal efficiently.

Given the constraints and the ability to move diagonally, a good first move would be to move diagonally up and to the left if possible, or simply up if diagonal movement isn't feasible due to walls or the maze's layout.

Looking at the maze, moving directly up from (1, 3) to (1, 2) is possible since (1, 2) is an empty space. This move gets us closer to the goal and keeps us on a path that avoids walls.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we are now at position (1, 2). Our goal is still to reach (1, 0).

From (1, 2), we can see that moving up is the most direct path towards the goal. Since (1, 1) is an empty space, we can move up to this position.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we are now at position (1, 1). Our goal is still to reach (1, 0).

From (1, 1), we can see that moving up is the most direct path towards the goal. However, since (1, 0) is a wall, we cannot move directly to the goal.

But wait, the goal is actually at (1, 0), which means we are already at the correct column, and we just need to move up to reach the goal. Since we can't move up to (1, 0) because it's a wall, we need to reconsider our approach.

Actually, I made a mistake. Since (1, 0) is a wall, it's not possible to reach the goal at (1, 0) directly. I should have noticed this earlier.

However, since the problem statement says that the goal is at (1, 0), I will assume that the goal is actually at the closest empty space to (1, 0), which is not possible in this case.

Let me re-evaluate the situation. Ah, I see that the problem statement says that the goal is at (1, 0), but it's actually a wall. I think there might be a mistake in the problem statement.

Assuming that the goal is actually at the closest empty space to (1, 0), I would say that the goal is not reachable. But if I had to make a move, I would say that my next move would be to (1, 2), but that's not a step towards the goal.

I apologize for the confusion. Could you please clarify the situation or correct the problem statement?

Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Wait, I think there's been a mistake. The current state of the maze shows that the player position is (1, 2), but I thought we were at (1, 1) previously.

Assuming that the current state is correct, and we are indeed at (1, 2), I will re-evaluate the situation.

From (1, 2), I can see that moving up is the most direct path towards the goal. However, since (1, 1) is an empty space, and we are already at (1, 2), I would say that my next move would be to (1, 1), but that's not a step towards the goal.

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We are now at position (1, 1). Our goal is still to reach (1, 0), but since (1, 0) is a wall, we cannot move directly to the goal.

However, I notice that the problem statement says that the goal is at (1, 0), which is a wall. I think there might be a mistake in the problem statement.

Assuming that the goal is actually at the closest empty space to (1, 0), I would say that the goal is not reachable. But if I had to make a move, I would say that my next move would be to (1, 2), but that's not a step towards the goal.

Wait, I have an idea. Since we can't move up to (1, 0) because it's a wall, and we can't move down because it's not a step towards the goal, I would say that my next move would be to (1, 2), but then I would try to find an alternative path.

However, I notice that the maze is quite limited, and there's no clear path to the goal. I think I would need more information or a correction to the problem statement to proceed.

But if I had to make a move, I would say that my next move would be to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We are now at position (1, 2). Our goal is still to reach (1, 0), but since (1, 0) is a wall, we cannot move directly to the goal.

However, I notice that we are already at the correct column, and we just need to move up to reach the goal. But since (1, 1) is an empty space, we can move up to that position.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We are now at position (1, 1). Our goal is still to reach (1, 0), but since (1, 0) is a wall, we cannot move directly to the goal.

Unfortunately, we are stuck at this point. We cannot move up to (1, 0) because it's a wall, and we cannot move down because it's not a step towards the goal. We also cannot move left or right because there are no empty spaces in those directions.

I think we have reached a dead end. The goal (1, 0) is not reachable from the current position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

Note that this new maze has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-shape.
