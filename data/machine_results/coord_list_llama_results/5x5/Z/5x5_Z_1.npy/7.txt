You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we'll adapt our approach to accommodate these requirements.

Given the current player position (P) at (1, 3) and the goal position (G) at (1, 0), our objective is to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

First, let's analyze the maze and the possible moves from the current position:

- Current position: (1, 3)
- Goal position: (1, 0)
- Walls and empty spaces are as given.

From (1, 3), considering diagonal moves are allowed, the possible next moves are:
- Up: (1, 2)
- Down: Not possible due to a wall at (2, 3) and the current position being at the edge in the vertical direction for empty spaces.
- Left: Not possible directly, but diagonally up-left is an option.
- Right: Not possible due to a wall.
- Diagonally up-left: (0, 2) is a wall, so not possible.
- Diagonally up-right: Not possible due to a wall at (0, 4) and the current position's constraints.
- Diagonally down-left: Not possible due to the wall at (2, 3) and the current position.
- Diagonally down-right: Not possible due to the wall at (2, 4).

Given these constraints, the most direct and only feasible move from (1, 3) towards the goal (1, 0) is to move up to (1, 2), which is an empty space.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we'll analyze the possible moves from the current position (1, 2) to reach the goal (1, 0).

From (1, 2), considering diagonal moves are allowed, the possible next moves are:
- Up: (1, 1) is an empty space and moves us closer to the goal.
- Down: (1, 3) is an empty space but moves us away from the goal.
- Left: Not possible directly, but diagonally up-left is an option, however, (0, 1) is a wall.
- Right: Not possible due to a wall at (1, 4) and the current position's constraints.
- Diagonally up-left: Not possible due to the wall at (0, 1).
- Diagonally up-right: Not possible due to the wall at (0, 3) and the current position's constraints.
- Diagonally down-left: Not possible due to the wall at (0, 3) and the current position.
- Diagonally down-right: Not possible due to the wall at (1, 4) and the current position.

Given these constraints, the most direct and feasible move from (1, 2) towards the goal (1, 0) is to move up to (1, 1), which is an empty space.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we'll analyze the possible moves from the current position (1, 1) to reach the goal (1, 0).

From (1, 1), considering diagonal moves are allowed, the possible next moves are:
- Up: Not possible due to a wall at (0, 1).
- Down: (1, 0) is the goal position, but we need to check if it's accessible.
- Left: Not possible directly, but diagonally up-left is an option, however, (0, 0) is a wall.
- Right: Not possible due to a wall at (1, 4) and the current position's constraints.
- Diagonally up-left: Not possible due to the wall at (0, 0).
- Diagonally up-right: Not possible due to the wall at (0, 2) and the current position's constraints.
- Diagonally down-left: Not possible due to the wall at (0, 0) and the current position.
- Diagonally down-right: Not possible due to the wall at (1, 4) and the current position.

Given these constraints, the most direct and feasible move from (1, 1) towards the goal (1, 0) is to move down to (1, 0), which is the goal position.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (1, 0)

Note: Since we've reached the goal position, this is the final move.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form an L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 0)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is an L-shape, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
