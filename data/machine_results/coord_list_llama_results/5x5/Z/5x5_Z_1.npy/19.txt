You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we'll adapt our approach to accommodate these requirements.

Given the current player position (P) at (1, 3) and the goal position (G) at (1, 0), we'll analyze the maze to determine the next move.

1. **Analyze the Current Position and Goal**: The player is at (1, 3), and the goal is at (1, 0). The direct path is blocked by walls, so we need to find an alternative route.

2. **Identify Possible Moves**: From (1, 3), considering diagonal moves, the possible empty spaces to move into are limited. We can move to (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (2, 2) directly. However, since our goal is to move towards (1, 0), moving to (1, 2) is the most direct step towards the goal without hitting a wall.

3. **Choose the Next Move**: Based on the analysis, the best next move is to (1, 2), as it moves us closer to the goal and avoids walls.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: **(1, 2)**.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we'll analyze the current position and determine the next move.

1. **Analyze the Current Position and Goal**: The player is now at (1, 2), and the goal remains at (1, 0). The direct path is still blocked by walls, but we're closer to the goal.

2. **Identify Possible Moves**: From (1, 2), considering diagonal moves, the possible empty spaces to move into are (1, 1) or (2, 2). However, since our goal is to move towards (1, 0), moving to (1, 1) is the most direct step towards the goal without hitting a wall.

3. **Choose the Next Move**: Based on the analysis, the best next move is to (1, 1), as it moves us closer to the goal and avoids walls.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: **(1, 1)**.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we'll analyze the current position and determine the next move.

1. **Analyze the Current Position and Goal**: The player is now at (1, 1), and the goal is at (1, 0). The direct path is blocked by a wall at (0, 0), but we can see that the goal is just one step away.

2. **Identify Possible Moves**: From (1, 1), considering diagonal moves, the possible empty spaces to move into are not directly towards the goal due to the wall. However, we can move diagonally to (0, 0) is not possible, but we can move to (2, 1) or (2, 2) or (1, 2) or (1, 3) or (3, 1) or (2, 0) is not possible. However, since our goal is to move towards (1, 0), moving to (2, 1) or (2, 2) or (1, 2) or (1, 3) or (3, 1) is not the most direct step towards the goal.

3. **Choose the Next Move**: Based on the analysis, the best next move is not directly towards the goal, but we can move to (2, 1) or (2, 2) or (1, 2) or (1, 3) or (3, 1). However, we can move to (2, 1) or (2, 2) or (1, 2) or (1, 3) or (3, 1) is not the most direct step towards the goal. However, we can move to (2, 1) or (2, 2) or (1, 2) or (1, 3) or (3, 1) is not the most direct step towards the goal. However, we can move to (2, 1) or (2, 2) or (1, 2) or (1, 3) or (3, 1) is not the most direct step towards the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Path:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or more specifically, a "Bent Corridor" shape. This shape is characterized by a main corridor that changes direction at a right angle, forming an "L" shape.

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same "Bent Corridor" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces form a recognizable "Bent Corridor" shape, similar to the original maze.
