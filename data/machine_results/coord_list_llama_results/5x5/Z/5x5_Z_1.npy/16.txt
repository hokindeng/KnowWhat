You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we'll adapt our approach to accommodate these requirements.

Given the current player position (P) at (1, 3) and the goal position (G) at (1, 0), our objective is to navigate from P to G.

First, let's analyze the maze and the possible moves from the current position (1, 3):

- The position directly above (1, 2) is an empty space.
- The position directly below (1, 4) is a wall.
- The positions to the left and right are walls at (0, 3) and (2, 3), respectively.
- Diagonal moves are also possible, but given the current position and the layout of the maze, moving diagonally would not be beneficial in this step.

Given these observations, the best next move from (1, 3) would be to move up to (1, 2), as it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we are at position (1, 2), let's analyze the possible moves:

- The position directly above (1, 1) is an empty space.
- The position directly below (1, 3) is an empty space, but we just came from there, so moving back would not be beneficial.
- The positions to the left and right are walls at (0, 2) and (2, 2), respectively.
- Diagonal moves are also possible, but given the current position and the layout of the maze, moving diagonally would not be beneficial in this step.

Given these observations, the best next move from (1, 2) would be to move up to (1, 1), as it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we are at position (1, 1), let's analyze the possible moves:

- The position directly above (1, 0) is the goal position.
- The position directly below (1, 2) is an empty space, but we can move directly to the goal.
- The positions to the left and right are walls at (0, 1) and (2, 1), respectively.
- Diagonal moves are also possible, but given the current position and the layout of the maze, moving diagonally would not be beneficial in this step.

Given these observations, the best next move from (1, 1) would be to move up to (1, 0), as it is the goal position.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (1, 0)

We have reached the goal!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (3, 0)

Note that this new maze has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape.
