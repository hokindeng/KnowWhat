You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a simple pathfinding approach since the maze is relatively small and we're allowed to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space. Given the current player position (1, 3) and the goal position (1, 0), we aim to move towards the goal while avoiding walls.

First, let's visualize the maze with the given information:

```
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)
```

Given the player's current position at (1, 3) and the goal at (1, 0), the most direct path would involve moving up. However, since we can only move to adjacent empty spaces, we need to find a path that avoids walls and utilizes the empty spaces effectively.

The direct path upwards is blocked by walls at (0, 3) and potentially other positions, so we need to navigate around these obstacles. A viable first move would be to move diagonally or directly to an adjacent empty space that brings us closer to the goal.

Considering the empty spaces and the goal's position, a reasonable first move from (1, 3) could be to move to (1, 2), as it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal at (1, 0) without immediately hitting a wall.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: **(1, 2)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze state, we can reassess the path to the goal. Given the current player position at (1, 2) and the goal at (1, 0), the most direct path would be to move upwards. However, we need to ensure that we're moving to an adjacent empty space.

Looking at the empty spaces, we see that (1, 1) is available and is directly above our current position, bringing us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: **(1, 1)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze state, we can see that we're now at (1, 1) and the goal is at (1, 0). Since we can move to adjacent empty spaces, and there are no empty spaces directly below us, we need to find an alternative path.

However, looking at the maze, we notice that the goal position (1, 0) is actually a wall. This means we cannot move directly to the goal as it is blocked.

Given the current state, we need to reassess our approach. Since we cannot move to the goal directly, we should try to move to a position that might allow us to find an alternative path or wait for further updates to the maze.

In this case, moving to an adjacent empty space that doesn't block our potential future moves would be a good strategy. One option is to move to (1, 2), which is an empty space and keeps our options open.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: **(1, 2)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back at (1, 2) and the goal is still at (1, 0), which is a wall. Since we can't move directly to the goal, we need to find an alternative path.

Looking at the maze, we notice that the space above us, (1, 1), is empty. We've been here before, but it's still a viable option. Moving to (1, 1) doesn't block our potential future moves and keeps us close to the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: **(1, 1)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back at (1, 1) and the goal is still at (1, 0), which is a wall. We've tried moving up and down, but we still can't reach the goal directly.

Let's think about this... Since we can't move to the goal directly, we need to find a way to "trick" the maze into letting us reach the goal. However, looking at the maze, we realize that the goal position (1, 0) is indeed a wall, and there's no way to move to it.

In this case, I think we've reached a point where we need to acknowledge that the goal position (1, 0) is not reachable, given the current state of the maze. The wall at (1, 0) blocks our path, and there's no alternative route to the goal.

Therefore, I'd like to declare that the goal position (1, 0) is not reachable, and we've reached a dead end.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I'd say that the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a **"L-shape"**.

Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and forms an L-shape with its corridors. Note that it's not an identical copy of the original maze, and the path from P to G is different.
