You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a simple pathfinding approach since the maze is relatively small and we're allowed to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space.

Given the current player position is (1, 3) and the goal is (1, 0), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal while avoiding walls.

Looking at the maze, the most direct path from (1, 3) to (1, 0) involves moving up. However, we need to avoid walls and ensure we're moving through empty spaces.

The empty spaces are: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)

Since the goal is directly above the current position but is blocked by a wall at (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), and (0, 4), we cannot move directly up from (1, 3) to (1, 0) without going around the walls.

A viable first move would be to move diagonally up-left from (1, 3) to (0, 2) is not possible due to the wall, so we consider moving to an adjacent empty space that brings us closer to the goal. Moving directly up is not possible due to the wall at (0, 3), so we look for an alternative route.

Given the constraints, a reasonable next move would be to move left from (1, 3) to (1, 2), as (1, 2) is an empty space and it moves us closer to the goal position (1, 0) without directly trying to go through a wall.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at (1, 2), we need to continue moving towards the goal (1, 0). Since we can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we look for the next best move.

Given the current position (1, 2) and the goal (1, 0), the most direct path would be to move up. However, we need to ensure we're moving through empty spaces.

Looking at the maze, we can see that (1, 1) is an empty space directly below (1, 2) and above the goal (1, 0). Therefore, a reasonable next move would be to move down from (1, 2) to (1, 1).

This move brings us closer to the goal without going through any walls.

My next move would be to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at (1, 1), we're very close to the goal (1, 0). However, we notice that the space directly above (1, 0) is a wall, and we cannot move diagonally up-left to (0, 0) because it's also a wall.

But, since we can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we look for an alternative route.

Unfortunately, there is no empty space directly adjacent to (1, 1) that would bring us closer to the goal without going through a wall. We are blocked by walls at (0, 0) and (0, 1).

However, we can see that moving right from (1, 1) to (1, 2) is not a viable option since it would move us away from the goal. We also cannot move down since (1, 0) is the goal and we cannot move through the wall at (0, 1).

Considering the available options, we can move right is not an option, moving down is not an option, moving up is not an option, moving left is not an option. We are stuck.

Wait, we can move diagonally down-left to (0, 0) is not an option, but we can move diagonally down-right is not an option. We can move diagonally up-right is not an option, but we can move diagonally up-left is not an option.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".
