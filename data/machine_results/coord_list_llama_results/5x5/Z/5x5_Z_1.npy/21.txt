You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move towards the goal position (G) at (1, 0) from the current player position (P) at (1, 3).

First, let's visualize the maze based on the provided information:

```
W W W W W
W E E W W
W W E W W
E E W W W
E E E E E
```

- `W` represents walls.
- `E` represents empty spaces.
- The player position (P) is at (1, 3), which is an empty space not directly shown in this simplified representation but is part of the "E" spaces.
- The goal (G) is at (1, 0), also an "E" space.

Given the player's current position at (1, 3) and the goal at (1, 0), the most direct path would involve moving up. However, since we can move diagonally and the maze allows for it, we should consider the most efficient path.

The direct path upwards is blocked by walls at certain points, but we can see a potential path by moving diagonally or horizontally to avoid walls and then moving upwards.

A possible first move, considering we want to move towards the goal and avoid walls, would be to move diagonally up-left from (1, 3) to (0, 2). However, since (0, 2) is a wall, this move is not possible.

Given the constraints and the layout, a feasible first move would be to move up from (1, 3) to (1, 2), as it's an empty space and moves us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: **(1, 2)**.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we're now at position (1, 2). Our goal is still to reach (1, 0).

Looking at the maze, the most direct path to the goal would be to move up. However, since (0, 1) and (0, 2) are walls, we cannot move directly up from our current position.

A feasible next move would be to move left from (1, 2) to (1, 1), as it's an empty space and moves us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: **(1, 1)**.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we're now at position (1, 1). Our goal is still to reach (1, 0).

Since we're already at the correct x-coordinate (1) and only need to move up one space to reach the goal, we can see that the only obstacle is the wall at (0, 1) and (0, 0). However, since we're at (1, 1), we can move up to (1, 0) directly.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: **(1, 0)**.

This move should put us at the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor". The empty spaces form a path that initially moves horizontally and then turns to move vertically, resembling the shape of the letter "L".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces form an L-shape, with the path initially moving horizontally and then turning to move vertically. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original maze, but rather a new configuration that meets the specified criteria.
