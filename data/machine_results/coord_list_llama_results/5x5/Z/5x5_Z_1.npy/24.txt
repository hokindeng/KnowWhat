You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we'll adapt our approach to accommodate these requirements.

Given the current player position (P) at (1, 3) and the goal position (G) at (1, 0), we'll start by examining the possible moves from the current position.

The current position is (1, 3), and the possible moves (considering only empty spaces and avoiding walls) are:

- Up: (1, 2)
- Down: Not possible due to a wall at (2, 3) and the current position being at the edge of the empty space in the vertical direction.
- Left: Not possible due to a wall at (0, 3).
- Right: Not possible due to a wall at (2, 3).
- Diagonals: The only possible diagonal move is to (2, 2), but considering the goal is to move towards (1, 0), moving diagonally to (2, 2) does not directly contribute to reaching the goal efficiently.

Given the constraints and the goal to move towards (1, 0), the most direct and efficient move from (1, 3) is to move up to (1, 2), which is an empty space.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player position at (1, 2), we'll examine the possible moves:

- Up: (1, 1)
- Down: (1, 3) - This is the previous position, so it's not a preferred move.
- Left: Not possible due to a wall at (0, 2).
- Right: Not possible due to a wall at (2, 2) is not a wall, but moving right would not contribute to reaching the goal efficiently.
- Diagonals: Moving diagonally to (2, 1) is not possible due to a wall at (2, 1), and moving diagonally to (0, 1) is not possible due to a wall at (0, 1).

Considering the goal is to move towards (1, 0), the most direct and efficient move from (1, 2) is to move up to (1, 1), which is an empty space.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player position at (1, 1), we'll examine the possible moves:

- Up: Not possible due to a wall at (0, 1) and the goal position (1, 0) is blocked by the wall at (0, 1) but we can move up to (1, 0) if we can find a way to bypass the wall.
- Down: (1, 2) - This is a possible move, but it would not contribute to reaching the goal efficiently.
- Left: Not possible due to a wall at (0, 1).
- Right: Not possible due to a wall at (2, 1).
- Diagonals: Moving diagonally to (2, 0) is not possible due to a wall at (2, 0), and moving diagonally to (0, 0) is not possible due to a wall at (0, 0).

However, we can see that the goal position (1, 0) is actually adjacent to the current position (1, 1), and the wall at (0, 1) does not block the move to (1, 0). Therefore, the most direct and efficient move from (1, 1) is to move up to (1, 0), which is the goal position.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (1, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-shape, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
