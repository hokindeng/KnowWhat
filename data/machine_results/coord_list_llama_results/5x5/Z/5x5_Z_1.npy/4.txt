You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a simple pathfinding approach since the maze is relatively small and we're allowed to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space.

Given the current player position is (1, 3) and the goal is (1, 0), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal while avoiding walls.

Looking at the maze, the most direct path from (1, 3) to (1, 0) involves moving up through the empty spaces. However, we need to avoid the walls and navigate through the available path.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 3)
2. **Goal**: (1, 0)

Since we can move diagonally, let's aim to move up and left to get closer to the goal efficiently.

**Next Move**: To move closer to the goal, we should aim for a position that is both up and to the left of the current position, if possible, or at least move in a direction that gets us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

Given the constraints and the layout, moving directly up from (1, 3) to (1, 2) is a viable first step because (1, 2) is an empty space.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (1, 2)

This move keeps us on a path towards the goal while avoiding walls and utilizing the available empty spaces for navigation.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, we're now at position (1, 2) and our goal remains (1, 0). We need to continue moving towards the goal while avoiding walls.

Looking at the maze, the most direct path to the goal from our current position involves moving up. However, we should also consider moving diagonally if it helps us avoid walls or reach the goal more efficiently.

**Next Move**: Since moving directly up from (1, 2) to (1, 1) is a viable option and (1, 1) is an empty space, we can make this move to get closer to the goal.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (1, 1)

This move keeps us on a path towards the goal, utilizing the available empty spaces for navigation and avoiding walls.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, we're now at position (1, 1) and our goal is (1, 0). We're very close to the goal.

**Next Move**: Since moving directly up from (1, 1) to (1, 0) is not possible due to the wall at (1, 0) being part of the maze's outer boundary, we actually need to move diagonally or find an alternative path. However, given the maze's layout, we can see that the goal (1, 0) is actually blocked by a wall at (0, 0) and (0, 1), but there's no wall at (1, 0) itself. It seems there was an oversight in the initial problem statement or the maze representation.

Given the corrected understanding that (1, 0) is indeed the goal and not blocked by a wall in the path, but rather the maze's boundary, the correct next move would be to move to the goal directly if possible or find an alternative path if not. However, since we cannot move through walls and the goal is directly above us but blocked by the maze's boundary, we must reconsider our approach based on the maze's actual constraints.

**Reevaluation**: Given the maze's constraints and the goal's position, it seems we've reached a point where a direct move to the goal is not possible due to the maze's boundary. However, this is a misunderstanding of the maze's layout. The goal (1, 0) is indeed reachable but considering the maze's boundary and the walls, we need to acknowledge that the maze as described initially might have led to confusion.

**Corrected Approach**: Given the maze's layout and the goal's position, if we were to follow the initial instructions strictly and aim for (1, 0) without considering the maze's boundary as a wall, we would realize that the goal is actually not reachable as initially thought due to the maze's constraints. However, this is a misinterpretation of the maze's layout.

**Actual Next Move**: Given the constraints and aiming to correct the approach, we should acknowledge that without a clear path to (1, 0) due to the maze's boundary and the walls, we need to reconsider the maze's layout and the goal's accessibility. However, since we are at (1, 1) and the goal is (1, 0), and considering the maze's layout might have been misinterpreted, the actual next move should aim to reach the goal if possible or find an alternative path.

Given the maze's layout and the goal's position, and correcting for the misunderstanding, the next move should indeed aim to reach the goal directly if possible.

**Next Move Coordinates**: Given the corrected understanding and aiming to reach the goal, the next move would indeed be to move to the goal if possible. However, considering the maze's constraints and the goal's position, and acknowledging the potential misunderstanding in the maze's layout, the correct approach would be to move to the goal if it's reachable.

However, considering the strict format and the need to provide a next move, and acknowledging the potential for confusion in the maze's layout and the goal's accessibility, the correct approach would be to clarify the maze's constraints and the goal's position. But given the format and the need to provide a next move:

**Next Move Coordinates**: (1, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Path:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "L-shaped" or "Elbow-shaped" path. This is because the empty spaces form a path that initially moves in one direction and then turns at a right angle to continue in another direction.

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shaped or Elbow-shaped path:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-shaped or Elbow-shaped path, similar to the original maze.
