You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since we are only asked for the next move and not the entire path, we can simplify the process by examining the immediate neighbors of the current player position and selecting the one that moves us closer to the goal or is a valid move towards the goal.

Given the player position is (1, 3) and the goal is (1, 0), we need to move towards the goal. The possible moves from (1, 3) are up, down, left, right, and diagonals. However, since the goal is directly above us, we prioritize moving up.

The current position is (1, 3), and moving up would place us at (1, 2). This is a valid move since (1, 2) is listed as an empty space.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We are now at position (1, 2) and the goal is still at (1, 0). To move closer to the goal, we need to move up.

The position directly above (1, 2) is (1, 1), which is listed as an empty space. Therefore, the next move is to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We are now at position (1, 1) and the goal is at (1, 0). To move closer to the goal, we need to move up.

However, the position directly above (1, 1) is (0, 1), which is listed as a wall. We cannot move up.

Since we cannot move up, we need to find an alternative path. We can move left or right, but since the goal is directly above us, moving left or right would not bring us closer to the goal.

But we can move diagonally up-left or up-right. The position diagonally up-left is (0, 0), which is a wall, so we cannot move there.

The position diagonally up-right is not possible since it would be out of bounds.

However, we can move diagonally down-left or down-right, but that would move us away from the goal.

We can move right to (2, 1), but that would also move us away from the goal.

We can move down to (2, 1), but that would also move us away from the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

Note that this new maze has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape.
