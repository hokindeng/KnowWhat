You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we'll adapt our approach to accommodate these requirements.

Given the current player position (P) at (1, 3) and the goal position (G) at (1, 0), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

First, let's analyze the maze and the possible moves from the current position:

- Current position: (1, 3)
- Goal position: (1, 0)
- Empty spaces adjacent to the current position: (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3) is not an option since it's a wall, and moving diagonally to (2, 4) is also not an option because (2, 4) is a wall.

The most direct path towards the goal from (1, 3) would be to move up. However, since we can move diagonally and the space (1, 2) is empty, we can consider moving diagonally or directly up if possible. But since moving directly up from (1, 3) to (1, 2) is the most straightforward move towards the goal and (1, 2) is an empty space, our next move should be:

(1, 2)

This move brings us closer to the goal and keeps us on a path that avoids walls.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at position (1, 2), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 0). Since we can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) and we're already on the correct column (column 1), our next move should aim to get closer to the goal by moving up.

Looking at the maze, the space directly above us, (1, 1), is empty. Therefore, our next move should be:

(1, 1)

This move brings us one step closer to the goal at (1, 0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces form an L-shape, similar to the original maze, but the maze is not an identical copy.
