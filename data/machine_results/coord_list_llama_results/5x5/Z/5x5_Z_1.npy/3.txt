You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we'll adapt our approach to accommodate these requirements.

Given the current player position (P) at (1, 3) and the goal position (G) at (1, 0), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal while avoiding walls.

1. **Current Position**: (1, 3)
2. **Goal Position**: (1, 0)
3. **Empty Spaces**: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)

Since we can move in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (1, 3):

- Moving up: (1, 2) is an empty space.
- Moving down: Not possible without hitting a wall or going out of bounds.
- Moving left/right: Not possible without hitting a wall.
- Diagonal moves: Not directly beneficial for reaching the goal without backtracking.

The most direct move towards the goal from (1, 3) would be to move up to (1, 2), as it brings us closer to the goal position (1, 0) and is an empty space.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 2)
2. **Goal Position**: (1, 0)
3. **Empty Spaces**: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)

From the current position (1, 2), we can analyze the possible moves:

- Moving up: (1, 1) is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.
- Moving down: (1, 3) is an empty space but takes us away from the goal.
- Moving left/right: Not possible without hitting a wall.
- Diagonal moves: Not directly beneficial for reaching the goal without backtracking.

The most direct move towards the goal from (1, 2) would be to move up to (1, 1), as it brings us closer to the goal position (1, 0) and is an empty space.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 1)
2. **Goal Position**: (1, 0)
3. **Empty Spaces**: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)

From the current position (1, 1), we can analyze the possible moves:

- Moving up: Not possible, as (1, 0) is the goal position and we can't move through it yet.
- Moving down: Not possible, as (1, 2) is an empty space but we've already been there.
- Moving left: Not possible, as it would hit a wall.
- Moving right: Not possible, as it would hit a wall.
- Diagonal moves: Not directly beneficial for reaching the goal without backtracking.

However, considering the goal position is directly above us, we can try to move up to (1, 0) to reach the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces form an L-shape, similar to the original maze, but the maze is not an identical copy.
