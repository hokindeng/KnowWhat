You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a simple pathfinding approach since the maze is relatively small and we're allowed to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space. Given the current player position (1, 3) and the goal position (1, 0), we aim to move towards the goal while avoiding walls.

First, let's visualize the maze with the given information:

- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
- Empty spaces: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
- Player position: (1, 3)
- Goal: (1, 0)

Given the player's current position (1, 3) and the goal (1, 0), the most direct path would involve moving up. However, we need to navigate through the empty spaces. 

Since the goal is directly above the player but blocked by walls at (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), and (0, 3), and the player is at (1, 3), the first move should aim to get closer to the goal while avoiding walls. The empty space directly above (1, 3) is not available due to the wall at (0, 3), but moving diagonally up-left is not possible due to the wall at (0, 2) and (0, 1). Thus, the best initial move is to move left to (1, 2), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal by allowing future moves to navigate around the walls.

Therefore, the next move should be to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state with the player now at (1, 2), we continue to aim for the goal at (1, 0). The direct path up is still blocked by walls at (0, 1) and (0, 2), but we can see that moving up is the most direct approach towards the goal.

Since we are at (1, 2) and the space directly above is blocked by a wall, but the space to the left and up (diagonally) is not blocked by a wall (as (0, 1) is a wall but (1, 1) is an empty space), we can move diagonally up-left to (1, 1), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move should be to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state with the player now at (1, 1), we are very close to the goal at (1, 0). However, the space directly below (1, 1) is blocked by a wall at (0, 0) and (1, 0) is not directly accessible due to the wall at (0, 1) being right above it, but since (1, 0) is the goal and there's no wall at (1, 0) itself, we can actually move down to (1, 0) as it's an empty space in the context of the maze's goal.

Therefore, the next move should be to (1, 0), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor". The path from the player position to the goal forms a roughly L-shaped route.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

This new maze has a similar L-shaped path from the player position to the goal, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces.
