You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a simple pathfinding approach since the maze is relatively small and we're allowed to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space. Given the current player position (1, 3) and the goal position (1, 0), we aim to move towards the goal while avoiding walls.

First, let's visualize the maze with the given information:

```
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)
```

Given the player's current position at (1, 3) and the goal at (1, 0), the most direct path would involve moving up. However, we need to navigate around the walls and through the empty spaces.

A possible first move, considering we want to move towards the goal and avoid walls, would be to move diagonally up-left from (1, 3) to (0, 2) if it were an empty space. However, (0, 2) is a wall. Therefore, we look for the next best move.

Given the constraints and the layout, a viable first move would be to move up from (1, 3) to (1, 2), as (1, 2) is an empty space and it moves us closer to the goal.

So, my next move would be to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze state, we can reassess the path to the goal.

From the current player position (1, 2), we aim to move closer to the goal (1, 0). The most direct path would be to move up, but we need to navigate around the walls and through the empty spaces.

A possible next move would be to move up from (1, 2) to (1, 1), as (1, 1) is an empty space and it moves us closer to the goal.

So, my next move would be to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze state, we can reassess the path to the goal.

From the current player position (1, 1), we aim to move closer to the goal (1, 0). Since (1, 0) is directly above (1, 1) and there are no walls in the way, we can move up to reach the goal.

So, my next move would be to (1, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

This new maze has a similar L-shape formed by the empty spaces, but with a different configuration of walls and a new player position and goal.
