You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a simple pathfinding approach since the maze is relatively small and we're allowed to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space. Given the current player position (1, 3) and the goal position (1, 0), we aim to move towards the goal while avoiding walls.

First, let's visualize the maze based on the given information:

- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
- Empty spaces: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
- Player position: (1, 3)
- Goal: (1, 0)

Given the player's current position (1, 3) and the goal (1, 0), the most direct path involves moving up. However, we need to navigate through the empty spaces. 

Since the goal is directly above the player but is blocked by walls at (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), and (0, 3), and the player's current position is (1, 3), the first move should aim to get closer to the goal while avoiding walls. The empty space directly above (1, 3) is not available due to the wall at (0, 3), but moving diagonally up-left is not possible due to the wall at (0, 2) and (0, 1). Thus, the best initial move is to move left to (1, 2), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal by allowing future moves towards the top.

Therefore, my next move is to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state with the player's new position at (1, 2), the goal remains at (1, 0). The direct path upwards is still blocked by walls at (0, 1) and (0, 2), but now we are closer to the goal.

Since moving directly up is not possible due to the walls, and moving left or right would not bring us closer to the goal, the best move is to move up-left diagonally to (0, 1) if it were possible, but it's blocked by a wall. However, we can move up to (0, 2) if it were an empty space, but it's also blocked by a wall.

Considering the available empty spaces and the goal's position, the next best move is to move left to (1, 1), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal by allowing future moves towards the top.

Therefore, my next move is to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state with the player's new position at (1, 1), the goal is now directly below at (1, 0), but it's blocked by a wall at (0, 0) and (0, 1) is also a wall. However, since we are at (1, 1), we can see that moving down is not possible due to the wall at (0, 0) being directly below the goal, but we can move down to the goal if we can find a way around the wall.

Considering the available empty spaces and the goal's position, the next best move is to move down to the goal, but since it's blocked, we need to find an alternative route. Moving right to (1, 2) or (1, 3) would not bring us closer to the goal, and moving left is not possible since there's a wall at (0, 1).

However, we can move down to the goal if we can move around the wall. Since moving directly down is not possible, we can try to move around the wall by moving right and then down, but there's no empty space to the right that would allow us to move down. 

But we can see that moving down to the goal is possible if we can move around the wall at (0, 0). Since moving directly down is not possible, we can try to move around the wall by moving down and then left, but there's no empty space below that would allow us to move left.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces form an L-shape, similar to the original maze, but the maze is not an identical copy.
