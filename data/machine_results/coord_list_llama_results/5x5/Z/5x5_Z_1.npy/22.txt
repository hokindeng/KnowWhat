You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we'll adapt our approach to accommodate these requirements.

Given the current player position (P) at (1, 3) and the goal position (G) at (1, 0), our objective is to navigate from P to G through the empty spaces while avoiding walls.

First, let's visualize the maze and identify the possible moves from the current position (1, 3):

- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
- Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
- Player position: (1, 3)
- Goal: (1, 0)

From (1, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up: (1, 2) - This is an empty space and a valid move.
- Down: Not possible due to the wall at (2, 3).
- Left: Not possible due to the wall at (0, 3).
- Right: Not possible due to the wall at (1, 4).
- Diagonals: Moving diagonally up-left or up-right are not valid due to walls or being out of bounds.

Therefore, the only valid move from (1, 3) is up to (1, 2).

The next move is: **(1, 2)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 2), let's analyze the possible moves:

- Up: (1, 1) - This is an empty space and a valid move.
- Down: (1, 3) - This is an empty space, but we just came from there, so it's not a preferred move.
- Left: Not possible due to the wall at (0, 2).
- Right: Not possible due to the wall at (1, 4) and the wall at (2, 2) is not directly adjacent, but there is a wall at (2, 1) which blocks the diagonal move.
- Diagonals: Moving diagonally up-left is not valid due to the wall at (0, 1), but moving diagonally up-right is not possible due to the wall at (2, 1).

Since our goal is to reach (1, 0), moving up to (1, 1) is the most direct and valid move.

The next move is: **(1, 1)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 1), let's analyze the possible moves:

- Up: Not possible due to the wall at (0, 1).
- Down: (1, 0) - This is the goal position, but we need to verify if it's accessible. Since there is no wall at (1, 0), this is a valid move.
- Left: Not possible due to the wall at (0, 1).
- Right: Not possible due to the wall at (1, 4) and the wall at (2, 1).
- Diagonals: Moving diagonally up-left is not valid due to the wall at (0, 0), but moving diagonally down-left is not possible due to the wall at (0, 0).

Since our goal is to reach (1, 0) and it's directly accessible, we can move down to (1, 0).

The next move is: **(1, 0)**

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form an L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces form an L-shape, which is recognizable as the same general shape as the original maze.
