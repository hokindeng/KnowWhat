You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we'll adapt our approach to accommodate these requirements.

Given the current player position (P) at (1, 3) and the goal position (G) at (1, 0), we'll start by examining the possible moves from the current position.

The current position is (1, 3), and the possible moves (considering only empty spaces and avoiding walls) are:

- Up: (1, 2)
- Down: Not possible due to a wall at (2, 3) and the next space being out of bounds.
- Left: Not possible due to a wall at (0, 3).
- Right: Not possible due to a wall at (2, 3).
- Diagonals: The only viable diagonal move is to (0, 2), but this is not possible due to the wall at (0, 2). However, moving diagonally to (2, 2) is possible.

Given these options, the best next move to get closer to the goal (1, 0) while avoiding walls and moving through empty spaces is to move diagonally to (2, 2), as it keeps us in a position to potentially move towards the goal in subsequent steps.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), we'll examine the possible moves:

- Up: Not possible due to a wall at (2, 1).
- Down: Possible to (3, 2), but this would move us further away from the goal.
- Left: Possible to (1, 2), which moves us closer to the goal.
- Right: Not possible due to a wall at (3, 2).
- Diagonals: Moving diagonally to (1, 1) is possible and moves us closer to the goal.

Considering the options, the best next move to get closer to the goal (1, 0) is to move diagonally to (1, 1).

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 1), we'll examine the possible moves:

- Up: Not possible due to a wall at (1, 0), but wait, that's the goal! However, we can't move up because the goal is blocked by a wall. We need to find another way to reach the goal.
- Down: Possible to (1, 2), but this would move us further away from the goal.
- Left: Not possible due to a wall at (0, 1).
- Right: Not possible due to a wall at (2, 1).
- Diagonals: Not possible due to the walls surrounding the current position.

However, we can see that the goal (1, 0) is actually blocked by a wall, which means we can't reach it directly. We need to find an alternative path.

Let's re-examine the maze and look for a possible detour. We can see that moving down to (1, 2) and then trying to find a way around the wall might be an option.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 2), we'll examine the possible moves:

- Up: Not possible due to a wall at (1, 1), but wait, (1, 1) is actually an empty space! We can move up to (1, 1).
- Down: Possible to (1, 3), but this would move us further away from the goal.
- Left: Not possible due to a wall at (0, 2).
- Right: Not possible due to a wall at (2, 2).
- Diagonals: Not possible due to the walls surrounding the current position.

Since moving up to (1, 1) is possible, and we were previously at (1, 1), we can try to move up again to see if we can find a way around the wall blocking the goal.

However, we should note that the goal (1, 0) is still blocked by a wall. We need to find an alternative path.

Let's try to move up to (1, 1) again and re-evaluate the situation.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 1), we'll examine the possible moves:

- Up: Not possible due to a wall at (1, 0), which is the goal. However, we can see that the wall at (1, 0) is actually the goal itself, and we can't move up to it because it's blocked by a wall. But wait, there's no wall at (1, 0) that blocks the goal, the goal is actually at (1, 0) and it's not blocked by a wall, it's just that we can't move up to it because it's the goal.

Let's re-evaluate the situation. Since we can't move up to the goal, we need to find an alternative path. However, there is no alternative path, and we are already at the closest possible position to the goal.

In this case, we can conclude that the maze is actually solvable, and the solution is to move up to the goal. However, since we can't move up to the goal, we can't provide a next move.

But, if we were to ignore the fact that the goal is blocked by a wall (which it's not), we could say that the next move would be to move up to the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (1, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Note that this new maze has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape.
