You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a simple pathfinding approach since the maze is relatively small and we're allowed to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space.

Given the current player position is (1, 3) and the goal is (1, 0), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal while avoiding walls.

Looking at the maze, the most direct path from (1, 3) to (1, 0) involves moving up through the empty spaces. However, we must avoid the walls and navigate through the available path.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 3)
2. **Goal**: (1, 0)

Since we can move diagonally, and there are no walls directly above or to the sides of our current position that would block a diagonal move towards the goal, we can attempt to move diagonally up-left if possible, or simply up if a direct diagonal move is not feasible due to the maze's layout.

Given the empty spaces and the goal's position, a feasible next move would be to move up to (1, 2), as it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

**Next Move**: (1, 2)

This move is chosen because it:

- Is an empty space, thus not blocked by a wall.
- Moves us closer to the goal position (1, 0).
- Does not require navigating through walls or blocked paths.

After making this move, the maze will be updated, and we can reassess the next step based on the new position and the maze's layout.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Path:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "L-shaped" or "Elbow-shaped" path. This is because the empty spaces form a path that initially moves in one direction and then turns at a right angle to continue in another direction, resembling the shape of the letter "L".

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shaped path. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original and includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces.

**Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2)
**Empty:** (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)
**Player Position:** (1, 3)
**Goal:** (0, 3)

This new maze maintains the L-shaped path characteristic, with the empty spaces forming a corridor that turns at a right angle. The player starts at (1, 3) and aims to reach the goal at (0, 3), navigating through the empty spaces while avoiding the walls.
