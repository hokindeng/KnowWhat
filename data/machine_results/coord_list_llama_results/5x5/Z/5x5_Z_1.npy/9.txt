You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a simple pathfinding approach since the maze is relatively small and we're allowed to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space.

Given the current player position is (1, 3) and the goal is (1, 0), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal while avoiding walls.

1. **Current Position**: (1, 3)
2. **Goal**: (1, 0)

Looking at the maze, the most direct path from (1, 3) to (1, 0) involves moving up through the empty spaces. However, we need to navigate around the walls.

- **Step 1**: Move from (1, 3) to (1, 2). This is a direct move up into an empty space.
- **Step 2**: Move from (1, 2) to (1, 1). Again, moving up into an empty space.
- **Step 3**: Move from (1, 1) to (1, 0). This final move up reaches the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we've moved to (1, 2), we continue our path towards the goal (1, 0).

From (1, 2), we can move directly up to (1, 1), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're now at (1, 1), and the goal (1, 0) is just one step away.

Since the space directly below us, (1, 0), is the goal and it's an empty space (not a wall), we can move directly down to it.

Therefore, my next move is to (1, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**(1) General Shape of the Path:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "L-shape" or more specifically, a "right-angled L-shape" with an additional isolated path segment.

**(2) New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces that form a similar right-angled L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 1)

This new maze maintains the same size and includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G) through the empty spaces, while forming a recognizable right-angled L-shape with an additional isolated path segment.
