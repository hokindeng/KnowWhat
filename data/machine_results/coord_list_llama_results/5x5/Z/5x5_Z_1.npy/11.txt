You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move towards the goal (G) at (1, 0) from the current player position (P) at (1, 3).

First, let's visualize the maze with the given information:

```
W W W W W
W E E W W
W W E W W
W E W W W
E E E E W
```

- `W` represents walls.
- `E` represents empty spaces.
- The player position (P) is at (1, 3), which is the second row, fourth column, but since we're starting from (0,0), we adjust our view accordingly.
- The goal (G) is at (1, 0), which is the second row, first column.

Given the player's current position at (1, 3) and the goal at (1, 0), the most direct path would involve moving up and left. However, since we can move diagonally and the maze allows for it, we can consider diagonal moves as well.

The next move should aim to get closer to the goal. Since moving directly up is blocked by a wall at (1, 2) is not directly blocked but moving diagonally up-left is a more direct path to the goal, we'll choose that.

Therefore, the next move would be to (1, 2), moving diagonally up-left from (1, 3).

Please update the maze with this new position, and I'll proceed with the next step.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze appears to be a "L-shape" or more specifically, a "bent corridor" or "elbow shape". However, considering the empty spaces' arrangement, it can also be described as a "zigzag" or "staircase" shape, but given the overall layout, I'd lean towards describing it as a "bent corridor" or "L-shape with a diagonal extension".

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "L-shape with a diagonal extension" or "bent corridor" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

This new maze maintains the same size and includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces. The empty spaces form a recognizable "L-shape with a diagonal extension" or "bent corridor" shape, similar to the original maze but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces.
