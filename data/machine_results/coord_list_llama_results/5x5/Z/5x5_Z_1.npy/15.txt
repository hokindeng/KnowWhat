You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move towards the goal position (G) at (1, 0) from the current player position (P) at (1, 3).

First, let's analyze the maze:

- The player is at (1, 3).
- The goal is at (1, 0).
- The walls and empty spaces are as given.

Since we can move diagonally and the goal is directly above the player but blocked by walls, we need to find a path around these obstacles. The most direct path to the goal, considering the constraints, involves moving around the walls to reach the goal.

Given the layout, a possible first move could be to move diagonally up and to the left from (1, 3) to (0, 2), but since (0, 2) is a wall, this is not possible. Therefore, we should look for the next best move that brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

A viable first move would be to move up from (1, 3) to (1, 2), as (1, 2) is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

So, my next move would be to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at (1, 2), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 0). Since we can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we should aim to move up.

However, moving directly up from (1, 2) to (1, 1) is possible since (1, 1) is an empty space. This move brings us closer to the goal.

So, my next move would be to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at (1, 1), we're very close to the goal at (1, 0). However, we can't move directly down to (1, 0) because it's a wall.

Since we can move diagonally, we can try to move diagonally down and to the right or left to find a path around the wall. But in this case, moving diagonally down and to the right is not possible because (2, 0) is a wall.

However, we can move diagonally down and to the left, but there's no empty space to move to. We can't move down to (1, 0) because it's a wall, and we can't move left to (0, 0) because it's also a wall.

But we can move to the right to (2, 1), no, that's a wall. We can move down to (2, 1), no, that's not possible. We can move to the right to (2, 1), no, that's a wall. We can move to (2, 2), that's an empty space.

However, moving to (2, 2) doesn't bring us closer to the goal. We need to find another way.

Let's think... We can move to the right to (2, 1), no, that's a wall. We can move to (2, 2), that's an empty space, but it doesn't bring us closer to the goal.

Wait, we can move to the left to (0, 1), no, that's a wall. But we can move to (0, 2), no, that's a wall. But we can move to (0, 3), no, that's a wall. But we can move to (0, 4), no, that's a wall.

However, we can move to the right to (2, 2), that's an empty space, but it doesn't bring us closer to the goal. We can move to (3, 1), that's an empty space, and it brings us closer to the goal.

So, my next move would be to (3, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (4, 1)

This new maze has a similar L-shape or bent corridor formed by the empty spaces, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The player can navigate from the starting position (0, 4) to the goal position (4, 1) through the empty spaces.
