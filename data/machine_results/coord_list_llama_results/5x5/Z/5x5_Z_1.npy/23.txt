You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we'll adapt our approach to accommodate these requirements.

Given the current player position (P) at (1, 3) and the goal position (G) at (1, 0), we'll analyze the maze to determine the next move.

Looking at the maze, the player's current position is (1, 3), and the goal is at (1, 0). The direct path to the goal is blocked by walls at (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), and (0, 4), as well as at (1, 4) and (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 4). However, there's an empty space at (1, 2) that is adjacent to the player's current position and is not blocked by walls.

Therefore, the next move should be to the empty space at (1, 2), as it moves the player closer to the goal and avoids walls.

The next move is: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, we'll analyze the current situation.

The player is now at (1, 2), and the goal is still at (1, 0). The direct path to the goal is still blocked by walls at (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), and (0, 4). However, there's an empty space at (1, 1) that is adjacent to the player's current position and is not blocked by walls.

Moving to (1, 1) would bring the player closer to the goal. Additionally, this move does not lead to a dead end, as there are no walls immediately below (1, 1) that would block further progress.

Therefore, the next move should be to the empty space at (1, 1).

The next move is: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the updated maze, we'll analyze the current situation.

The player is now at (1, 1), and the goal is at (1, 0). However, the space directly below the player, (1, 0), is blocked by a wall at (0, 0) and the goal is actually at (1, 0) which is not blocked by a wall at (1, 0) but rather the wall is at (0, 0). 

Since the goal is directly below the player and there are no walls at (1, 0), the player can move directly to the goal.

The next move is: (1, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces form an L-shape, similar to the original maze, but the maze is not an identical copy.
