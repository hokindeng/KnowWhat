You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we'll adapt our approach to accommodate these requirements.

Given the current player position (P) at (1, 3) and the goal position (G) at (1, 0), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

First, let's analyze the maze and the possible moves from the current position:

- Current position: (1, 3)
- Goal position: (1, 0)
- Empty spaces adjacent to the current position: (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 4) is blocked by a wall, and moving diagonally to (2, 4) is also blocked.

Given the constraints and the goal to move towards the goal position (1, 0), the most direct move would be to move up to (1, 2), as it brings us closer to the goal and keeps us on a path that could potentially lead directly to the goal without backtracking.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we need to continue navigating towards the goal position (1, 0) from the current player position (1, 2).

Analyzing the possible moves from the current position:

- Current position: (1, 2)
- Goal position: (1, 0)
- Empty spaces adjacent to the current position: (1, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3) is the previous position, so we don't want to move back there.

The most direct move towards the goal would be to move up to (1, 1), as it brings us closer to the goal position (1, 0).

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we need to continue navigating towards the goal position (1, 0) from the current player position (1, 1).

Analyzing the possible moves from the current position:

- Current position: (1, 1)
- Goal position: (1, 0)
- Empty spaces adjacent to the current position: (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (1, 0) is blocked by a wall, but wait, it's actually the goal position! However, we can't move directly to it because it's blocked by a wall at (0, 0) and (0, 1), but we can move to the goal position (1, 0) since it's not blocked by a wall at (1, 0).

However, we can't move to (1, 0) directly because it's blocked by a wall at (0, 1). We need to find an alternative route.

Since we can't move directly to the goal, we need to move to an adjacent empty space that will bring us closer to the goal. The best option is to move to (2, 2), but that would take us away from the goal. A better option is to move to (3, 1), but that would also take us away from the goal.

However, we can move to (1, 2) and then try to find an alternative route to the goal.

But, we can actually move to (1, 0) if we move diagonally from (1, 1) to (1, 0) is not possible, but we can move to (1, 0) if we move from (1, 1) to (1, 0) horizontally, but it's blocked by a wall at (0, 1). However, we can move to (1, 0) if we move from (1, 1) to (1, 0) horizontally, but we need to move to a position that is not blocked by a wall.

However, we can move to (1, 0) if we move from (1, 1) to (1, 0) horizontally, but we need to move to a position that is not blocked by a wall.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".
