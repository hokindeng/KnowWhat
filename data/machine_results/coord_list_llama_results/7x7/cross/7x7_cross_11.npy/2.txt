You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the rules for movement.
The maze is a 2D grid with specified walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The player can move to any adjacent empty space, which includes up, down, left, right, or any diagonal move.

## Step 2: Identify the starting position and the goal.
The player starts at position (6, 2) and needs to reach the goal at position (2, 6).

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves from the starting position.
Given the starting position (6, 2), we need to look at the empty spaces and determine the closest or most direct path towards the goal. Since the goal is at (2, 6), we should aim to move upwards and to the right.

## Step 4: Determine the next move based on the analysis.
Looking at the empty spaces, a direct path to the goal is not immediately available due to the walls. However, we can see that moving diagonally or directly up and right would be the most efficient way to progress towards the goal. Given the constraints of the maze and the available empty spaces, the best next move would be to move towards the empty space that brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move.
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal's position, moving to (5, 3) would be a strategic move as it brings us closer to the goal and keeps us on a path that could potentially lead us around the walls and towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze and the player's position.
The player is currently at position (5, 3), and the goal is at position (2, 6). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal while avoiding the walls.

## Step 2: Analyze the available moves from the current position.
Looking at the empty spaces, we can see that moving up and to the right is still the most direct path towards the goal. However, we need to navigate around the walls to reach the goal.

## Step 3: Determine the next move based on the analysis.
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal's position, moving to (5, 5) would be a strategic move as it brings us closer to the goal and keeps us on a path that could potentially lead us around the walls and towards the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move.
Since (5, 5) is an available empty space and it moves us closer to the goal, we will choose this as our next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 5)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The original maze has empty spaces that form a zigzag or a winding path, but upon closer inspection, it resembles a more complex shape. However, a simpler way to describe it would be to recognize that the path essentially forms a diagonal or a slanted line from the bottom right to the top left, with some deviations due to the walls. A more general term for this shape could be a "diagonal path" or simply a "slant." However, considering the constraints and the need for a more specific geometric term, we might describe the shape as resembling a "staircase" due to its step-like progression upwards and to the left.

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same size and a similar shape formed by the empty spaces.
To create a new maze that is not an identical copy but retains the same general shape, we can mirror the staircase-like path or adjust its orientation while keeping the same overall structure. Given the original maze's size and constraints, we will aim to create a mirrored version of the staircase path.

## Step 3: Encode the new maze.
For the new maze, we will keep the same size (7x7) and adjust the positions of the walls and empty spaces to form a mirrored staircase-like path. The player's position (P) will be at (2, 2), and the goal (G) will be at (6, 6) to maintain a similar challenge and direction of movement.

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (6, 6)

However, to truly mirror the staircase-like path and ensure the maze meets the criteria, adjustments are needed to create a clear, mirrored staircase path. Let's correct this by providing a new set of empty spaces that form a clearer, mirrored staircase path.

New Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)

This adjustment creates a clearer staircase path from the player's position to the goal, mirroring the original path's direction and shape.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Staircase}$
