You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the rules for movement.
The maze is a 2D grid with specified walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The player can move to any adjacent empty space, including diagonals.

## Step 2: Identify the starting position and the goal.
The player starts at position (6, 2) and needs to reach the goal at position (2, 6).

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find a path from the starting position to the goal.
Given the constraints of the maze, we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal. The direct path is blocked by walls, so we need to find a route that goes around these obstacles.

## Step 4: Determine the first move.
Looking at the maze, the first move should aim to get closer to the goal while avoiding walls. Since the goal is at (2, 6), we need to move upwards and to the left. However, the direct path upwards is blocked by walls at (5, 2) and (4, 2) are not directly accessible due to walls, so we need to find an alternative route.

## Step 5: Choose the next position.
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal to move upwards and leftwards, the next best move from (6, 2) would be to move diagonally or directly to an empty space that brings us closer to the goal. Given the layout, moving to (5, 3) is a viable option as it moves us closer to the goal and is an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and the goal.
The player is currently at position (5, 3) and needs to reach the goal at position (2, 6).

## Step 2: Analyze the available moves from the current position.
Given the maze layout, the player can move to adjacent empty spaces. The options from (5, 3) include moving up, down, left, right, or diagonally to an empty space.

## Step 3: Determine the best direction to move towards the goal.
Since the goal is at (2, 6), the player needs to move upwards and to the left. The most direct path would be to move diagonally or directly to an empty space that brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next position.
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal to move upwards and leftwards, the next best move from (5, 3) would be to move to (4, 4) as it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)

Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and the goal.
The player is currently at position (4, 4) and needs to reach the goal at position (2, 6).

## Step 2: Analyze the available moves from the current position.
Given the maze layout, the player can move to adjacent empty spaces. The options from (4, 4) include moving up, down, left, right, or diagonally to an empty space.

## Step 3: Determine the best direction to move towards the goal.
Since the goal is at (2, 6), the player needs to move upwards and to the left. However, moving directly left is blocked by walls, so we need to find an alternative route.

## Step 4: Choose the next position.
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal to move upwards and leftwards, the next best move from (4, 4) would be to move to (3, 5) as it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 5)}$

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 6)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The original maze's empty spaces form a shape that resembles a zigzag or a winding path, but more specifically, it can be described as a "meandering" or "serpentine" path. However, given the constraints and the layout, it's more accurate to describe it as a "bent" or "angled" path, but for simplicity and clarity, we can generalize it as a "zigzag" shape due to its back-and-forth pattern.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape characteristics.
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it has the same size (7x7), includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original, and forms a recognizable zigzag shape with its empty spaces.

## Step 3: Design the new maze.
Given the complexity of manually designing a maze that meets all these criteria, we'll simplify the process by ensuring the new maze has a clear zigzag path from the start to the goal, avoiding the creation of isolated areas or paths that do not lead to the goal.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze.
Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

This new maze forms a zigzag path from the player's position to the goal, meeting the criteria specified.

The final answer is: $\boxed{zigzag}$
