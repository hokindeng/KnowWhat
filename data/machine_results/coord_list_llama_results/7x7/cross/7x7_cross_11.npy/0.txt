You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the rules for movement.
The maze is a 2D grid with specified walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The player can move to any adjacent empty space, which includes up, down, left, right, or any diagonal move.

## Step 2: Identify the starting position and the goal.
The player starts at position (6, 2) and needs to reach the goal at position (2, 6).

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find a path from the starting position to the goal.
Given the constraints of the maze, we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal. Since the maze does not provide a straightforward path due to the placement of walls, we must find a route that avoids these obstacles.

## Step 4: Determine the next move based on the analysis.
From the starting position (6, 2), we look for an adjacent empty space that brings us closer to the goal (2, 6). Since moving directly up is blocked by walls, we consider diagonal or sideways moves that could eventually lead us to a path towards the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move.
Given the layout and the goal to move towards (2, 6), the best initial move from (6, 2) would be to move diagonally or directly towards the goal if possible. However, since the maze's layout forces us to navigate around walls, we look for the closest empty space that aligns with our goal. Moving to (6, 6) is not possible due to the wall, so we consider moving towards the empty spaces that could lead us to a clearer path.

## Step 6: Select the optimal next step.
Considering the maze's constraints and the need to move towards the goal, the optimal next step from (6, 2) would be to move to an empty space that is closer to the goal and not blocked by walls. Since direct vertical movement is blocked, we look for a diagonal or horizontal move that sets us up for future moves towards the goal.

## Step 7: Finalize the next move.
Given the constraints and the aim to move closer to the goal, the next move should be towards an empty space that offers the most flexibility for future moves. Since moving directly to the goal is not possible, we choose a move that navigates around the walls and towards the goal's general direction.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze and the player's position.
The player is currently at position (5, 3), and the goal is at position (2, 6). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal while avoiding the walls.

## Step 2: Analyze the possible moves from the current position.
From (5, 3), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to an adjacent empty space. We should prioritize moves that bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 3: Identify the optimal next move.
Considering the maze's layout and the goal's position, moving up and to the left seems to be the most promising direction. However, we need to find a specific empty space that is adjacent to our current position and aligns with our goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move.
Given the empty spaces available, moving to (4, 4) is a viable option. It brings us closer to the goal and sets us up for future moves that could navigate around the walls.

## Step 5: Finalize the next move.
After analyzing the maze and considering the possible moves, the next step from (5, 3) would be to move to (4, 4), as it offers a path towards the goal and avoids the walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The original maze's empty spaces form a shape that resembles a zigzag or a winding path, but more specifically, it can be described as a "meandering" or "serpentine" path. However, considering the constraints and the layout, a more fitting description would be a "bent" or "angled" path, but given the complexity and the need for a simple description, we can generalize it as a "zigzag" path.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape characteristics.
To create a new maze with the same shape characteristics, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a recognizable zigzag path. The new maze should have the same size as the original (7x7) and include a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Design the new maze.
Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (2, 6)

However, this is the original maze. Let's create a new one.

## Step 4: Generate a new maze.
Here is a new maze:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 6), (2, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (2, 6)

This new maze has a similar zigzag shape and meets the criteria.

The final answer is: $\boxed{zigzag}$
