You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Empty: (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 4)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (6, 6) and the goal is (4, 6), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space, we examine the surroundings of the current position.

## Step 3: Analyze the surroundings of the current position
Looking at the maze, the current position (6, 6) is surrounded by walls on all sides except for the space above it, which is also a wall, but there's an empty space at (6, 4) and another at (5, 5). However, the most direct path towards the goal would be to move up, but since the space directly above is a wall, we need to find an alternative route that involves moving diagonally or horizontally to an empty space that can eventually lead us to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the goal is to the left and slightly up from the current position, and given the constraints of the maze, the best next move would be to move diagonally or horizontally towards an empty space that brings us closer to the goal. Since moving directly up is blocked by a wall, and moving left or right without going up would not bring us closer to the goal efficiently, we look for a diagonal move that can help us navigate around the walls.

## Step 5: Choose the optimal diagonal move
Given the empty spaces available and the goal's position, moving diagonally up-left seems like the most efficient direction. However, since there are no empty spaces directly diagonally up-left from the current position, we need to reassess the available empty spaces and choose the one that best aligns with our goal.

## Step 6: Select the next move based on the analysis
Considering the empty spaces provided and the goal's location, the best move from (6, 6) would be to move to an empty space that is closer to the goal and allows for further movement towards it. Since (6, 4) is an empty space and moving to it does not directly block us from reaching the goal, and considering we need to move up and left, the move to (6, 4) is a strategic choice as it opens up possibilities for further moves towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(6, 4)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (4, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 4), which form a diagonal line. However, considering the context of maze solving and the typical shapes formed by corridors in mazes, it seems more appropriate to interpret the shape as a "straight line" or a "diagonal path" rather than a complex geometric shape. This interpretation is based on the fact that the empty spaces are aligned in a straight diagonal line from the bottom right to the top left of the maze.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same shape formed by its empty spaces
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will design a maze where the empty spaces form a diagonal line. This new maze should have the same size as the original (7x7) and include a valid path from P to G through empty spaces.

## Step 3: Define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal for the new maze
For the new maze, we will place the player position (P) at (0, 0) and the goal (G) at (6, 6). The empty spaces will form a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right. We will ensure that the maze is not an identical copy of the original and that it meets all the criteria.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (6, 6)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal line}$
