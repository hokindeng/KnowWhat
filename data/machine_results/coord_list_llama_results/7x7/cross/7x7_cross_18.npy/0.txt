You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Empty: (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 4)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The current player position is (6, 6), and the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, since the maze is surrounded by walls, the only possible move from the current position is to move up or diagonally up-left.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves and choose the best one
Since the goal position is (4, 6), moving up or diagonally up-left would bring us closer to the goal. However, moving diagonally up-left would also bring us closer to the empty space (5, 5), which could potentially be a part of the path to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the best next move would be to move diagonally up-left to (5, 5).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Empty: (4, 4), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the current state of the maze
The current player position is (5, 5), and the goal position is (4, 6). The maze has walls and empty spaces, and the objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The possible moves from the current player position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, since the maze has walls, the only possible moves are up, left, or diagonally up-left.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves and choose the best one
Moving up would bring us closer to the goal position, but it would also lead us to a wall. Moving left would bring us to an empty space, but it would not bring us closer to the goal position. Moving diagonally up-left would bring us to an empty space and also bring us closer to the goal position.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the best next move would be to move diagonally up-left to (4, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Empty: (5, 5), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the current state of the maze
The current player position is (4, 4), and the goal position is (4, 6). The maze has walls and empty spaces, and the objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The possible moves from the current player position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, since the maze has walls, the only possible moves are up or right.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves and choose the best one
Moving up would bring us closer to the goal position, and it is a valid move since there is no wall above the current position. Moving right would lead us to a wall.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the best next move would be to move up to (4, 5).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 5)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (4, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 4), and (6, 6). The general shape formed by these empty spaces is a diagonal line with a small branch.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The general shape formed by the empty spaces can be described as a "Diagonal Line with a Branch".

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to create a diagonal line with a small branch using empty spaces. We can place the empty spaces at (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), and (5, 4).

## Step 4: Define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position for the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (5, 4)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (3, 3)

The final answer is: There is no number to solve this problem, but the new maze is defined above.
