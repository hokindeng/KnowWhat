You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Empty: (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 4)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (6, 6) to the goal position (4, 6) while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces. Given the constraints and the maze layout, the optimal path involves moving diagonally or horizontally/vertically to reach the goal efficiently.

Starting from (6, 6), the goal is to move towards (4, 6). However, since the direct path is blocked by walls, we need to find an alternative route that utilizes the available empty spaces.

1. **Initial Move**: Since the player is at (6, 6) and the goal is at (4, 6), and considering the maze's layout, the first move should aim to get closer to the goal while avoiding walls. The empty space at (6, 4) is a potential stepping stone, but since we cannot move directly there due to the wall at (6, 5), we need to find an alternative.

2. **Alternative Route**: Given the constraints, moving diagonally or finding a path that goes around the walls is necessary. However, the provided empty spaces do not offer a direct diagonal move from (6, 6) to a closer position to the goal without hitting a wall.

3. **Reevaluation**: Upon reevaluating the maze, it becomes clear that the initial assessment overlooked the potential of moving to (5, 5) as a stepping stone. This move is not directly possible due to the wall at (6, 5), but it highlights the need to think about moving in a way that utilizes the available empty spaces more creatively.

4. **Correct Approach**: The correct first move involves moving to a position that sets up for a future move towards the goal. Given the layout, moving from (6, 6) to (6, 4) is not possible due to the wall at (6, 5). The actual viable move involves considering the empty spaces in a way that allows for a path around the walls.

Given the misstep in the initial analysis, let's correct the approach:

- The goal is to move from (6, 6) to (4, 6).
- Direct movement is blocked by walls.
- The empty spaces provided do not offer a straightforward path.

**Corrected Next Move**: Given the constraints and the need to navigate around walls, the first move should aim to utilize the available empty spaces effectively. However, the direct path to any of the empty spaces from (6, 6) is blocked, indicating a need to reassess the maze for a viable starting move.

Upon reassessment, considering the maze's layout and the goal to reach (4, 6) from (6, 6), and acknowledging the error in the initial steps, the focus should be on finding a path that navigates around the walls to reach the goal. The initial analysis did not correctly identify a viable first move due to the oversight of the maze's constraints and the available empty spaces.

Given the maze's layout and the constraints, a viable first move that correctly navigates towards the goal while avoiding walls and utilizing the empty spaces effectively needs to be reconsidered based on the maze's actual layout and the rules for movement.

**Revised Approach for a Solution**:

Given the complexity and the error in the initial analysis, a step-by-step solution requires a detailed reevaluation of the maze, focusing on navigating from (6, 6) to (4, 6) through the empty spaces while avoiding walls. The initial analysis did not provide a correct path due to an incorrect assessment of the maze's layout and the movement rules.

For a correct solution, one would typically use a pathfinding algorithm like A* or BFS, considering the maze's layout, the movement rules (up, down, left, right, diagonals), and the goal. However, without executing these algorithms step-by-step here, the key takeaway is the need to reassess the maze for a viable path that adheres to the movement rules and avoids walls.

**Final Note**: The initial analysis did not correctly solve the maze due to an incorrect assessment of the available moves and the maze's layout. A correct solution involves a detailed analysis of the maze, applying pathfinding techniques to navigate from the player's position to the goal while adhering to the movement rules and avoiding walls.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors)**:

The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze can be described as a "Disconnected Islands" or "Isolated Path Segments". This is because the empty spaces are not connected in a continuous path but rather form isolated segments or "islands" within the maze.

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape**:

Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces that form the same shape:

**Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)

**Empty:** (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 4), (3, 6), (2, 6)

**Player Position:** (6, 6)

**Goal:** (3, 6)

This new maze has the same size and shape characteristics as the original, with isolated path segments or "islands" of empty spaces. The player must navigate from the starting position (6, 6) to the goal (3, 6) through these isolated segments.
