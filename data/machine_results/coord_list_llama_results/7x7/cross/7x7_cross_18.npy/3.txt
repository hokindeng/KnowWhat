You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Empty: (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 4)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (6, 6) and the goal is (4, 6), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space, we look for empty spaces around the current position.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces around the current position
The empty spaces given are (4, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 4). Since the goal is to the left of the current position, we look for the closest empty space that moves us towards the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
The closest empty space that moves us towards the goal is (6, 4), as it is directly to the left of the current position and not blocked by walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(6, 4)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (4, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 4), which form a diagonal line from the bottom right to the middle left of the maze. This shape can be described as a diagonal line or a diagonal corridor.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape but different layout
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a diagonal line. We will place the empty spaces at different coordinates while maintaining the diagonal shape.

## Step 3: Determine the size of the new maze
The original maze has a size of 7x7, so the new maze will also be 7x7.

## Step 4: Place the empty spaces in the new maze
We will place the empty spaces at (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 6) to form a diagonal line.

## Step 5: Place the walls in the new maze
We will place the walls at all coordinates not occupied by empty spaces, except for the player position (P) and the goal position (G).

## Step 6: Determine the player position (P) and the goal position (G)
We will place the player position (P) at (1, 6) and the goal position (G) at (6, 1).

## Step 7: Encode the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (6, 1)

The final answer is: There is no number to solve this problem, the answer is the description of the shape and the new maze.
