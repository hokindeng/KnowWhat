You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Empty: (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 4)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (6, 6) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are to any adjacent empty space. Since the goal is to reach (4, 6), we should prioritize moving towards that direction.

## Step 3: Determine the best next move
Considering the empty spaces and the goal position, the best next move from (6, 6) would be to move towards the empty space that is closest to the goal. Since (6, 4) is an empty space and moving diagonally is allowed, the best next move would be to (6, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(6, 4)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (4, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 4), which form a diagonal line. However, considering the context of a maze and the movement restrictions, it's more accurate to describe the shape as a "Diagonal Path" or a "Diagonal Corridor". But given the constraints and the movement allowed (up, down, left, right, or diagonals), the shape resembles more a "L-shape" or a "Corner Path" since the diagonal movement allows for a more direct path but the empty spaces themselves form a corner-like shape.

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same shape formed by empty spaces
To create a new maze with the same shape (a "L-shape" or "Corner Path") but not an identical copy, we can adjust the positions of the walls and the empty spaces while maintaining the overall shape and ensuring a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Define the new maze's walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal
Given the original maze's size (7x7), we will maintain the same size for the new maze. We will adjust the positions of the walls and empty spaces to form a recognizable "L-shape" or "Corner Path" while ensuring a valid path from the player position to the goal.

New Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
New Empty Spaces: (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (5, 4)
New Player Position: (6, 6)
New Goal: (4, 6)

The final answer is: 
(1) L-shape or Corner Path
(2) Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Empty: (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (5, 4)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (4, 6)
