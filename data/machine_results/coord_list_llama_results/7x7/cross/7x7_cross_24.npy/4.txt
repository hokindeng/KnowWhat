You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (3, 4), we need to identify the possible moves. We can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, from the current player position (3, 4), the possible moves are limited due to the surrounding walls. The only possible move is to the position (3, 2) or (2, 3) since these are the only adjacent empty spaces.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (1, 2), the best next move would be to position (2, 3) as it brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (2, 3), and the goal is to reach position (1, 2). We need to analyze the possible moves from the current position.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves
Given the current player position (2, 3), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are to positions (1, 4), (3, 2), or (2, 4) since these are the only adjacent empty spaces.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Considering the goal position (1, 2), moving to position (1, 4) would bring us closer to the goal but not directly towards it. Moving to position (3, 2) would take us away from the goal. Moving to position (2, 4) is not a viable option since it's not directly towards the goal and might lead to a dead end.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
However, upon closer inspection, we notice that moving diagonally from (2, 3) to (1, 2) is a possible move since it's an empty space and it's directly towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 2)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at positions (1, 4), (2, 3), and (3, 2). These positions form a diagonal line from the top-right to the bottom-left of the maze, but considering the constraints and the goal, the path resembles more of an "L" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form an "L" shape. We will place the empty spaces at positions (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), and (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), and (5, 6) to form the "L" shape.

## Step 3: Define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal for the new maze
Walls: All positions not listed as empty spaces.
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (1, 2)

The final answer is: There is no numerical answer for this problem as it requires a descriptive and graphical response.
