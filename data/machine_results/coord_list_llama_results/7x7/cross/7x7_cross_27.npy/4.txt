You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a simple pathfinding approach since the maze is relatively small and we're allowed to move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals). Given the current player position (1, 3) and the goal position (1, 1), we aim to move towards the goal while avoiding walls.

First, let's analyze the maze and the possible moves from the current position (1, 3):

- Moving up is not possible because (0, 3) is a wall.
- Moving down is not possible because (2, 3) is a wall.
- Moving left is possible because (1, 2) is not listed as a wall or an empty space, but since it's not a wall, we can consider it as a potential path.
- Moving right is not possible because (1, 4) is a wall.
- Diagonal moves are also restricted due to the presence of walls in the adjacent squares.

Given the constraints, the best move from (1, 3) would be to move left to (1, 2), as it's the only direction that doesn't immediately hit a wall and brings us closer to the goal position (1, 1).

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze appears to be a "Disconnected Islands" or "Island-like" shape, where the empty spaces are scattered and not directly connected in a straightforward path from the player position to the goal.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "Disconnected Islands" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (5, 5)

This new maze maintains the same size and has a similar "Disconnected Islands" shape, with empty spaces scattered throughout the maze. The player must navigate through these "islands" to reach the goal.
