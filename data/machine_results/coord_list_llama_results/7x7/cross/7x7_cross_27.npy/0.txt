You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (1, 3) to the goal position (1, 1) while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, let's analyze the maze.

Starting from (1, 3), we need to move towards (1, 1). The direct path downwards is blocked by walls at (1, 2) and (1, 1) is not directly accessible due to the wall at (1, 2). However, we can move diagonally or horizontally to find a path around the walls.

Given the empty spaces and the goal, a viable first move would be to move diagonally from (1, 3) to (2, 2), as it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), we need to navigate towards the goal (1, 1). Since we cannot move directly to (1, 1) due to the wall at (1, 2), we should look for an alternative path.

Noticing the empty space at (3, 1), we can move diagonally from (2, 2) to (3, 1), which brings us closer to the goal and avoids walls.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 1), we need to navigate towards the goal (1, 1). Since we are already at the same y-coordinate as the goal, we can try to move horizontally towards the goal.

However, there is a wall at (2, 1), which blocks our direct path. We need to find an alternative route.

Noticing the empty space at (3, 3), we can move diagonally from (3, 1) to (3, 3), but this would take us further away from the goal.

A better option would be to move to (2, 2), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal. From there, we can reassess our next move.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), we need to navigate towards the goal (1, 1). Since we are already close to the goal, we can try to move horizontally towards the goal.

However, there is a wall at (2, 1), which blocks our direct path. We need to find an alternative route.

Noticing that we can move diagonally, we can move from (2, 2) to (1, 3), which is an empty space. From there, we can reassess our next move.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 3), we need to navigate towards the goal (1, 1). Since we are already at the same x-coordinate as the goal, we can try to move vertically towards the goal.

Noticing that there is no wall at (1, 2), we can move from (1, 3) to (1, 2), which brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Disconnected Islands" or " Fragmented Path" shape, but more specifically, it resembles a "L-Shaped" or "Bent" path with isolated segments.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-Shaped path:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

This new maze has a similar L-Shaped path formed by the empty spaces, but with a different configuration and a new starting and goal position.
