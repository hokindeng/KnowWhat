You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (5, 5), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where we can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the nearest empty space to the goal
From the given empty spaces, (3, 5), (4, 4), and (5, 3), we need to find the nearest one to the goal (3, 3) that is also reachable from the current position (5, 5).

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the analysis
The nearest empty space to the goal that is also reachable from the current position is (5, 3). However, we cannot move directly to (5, 3) because it is not adjacent to the current position (5, 5). We need to find an intermediate step.

## Step 5: Find an intermediate step to reach the chosen empty space
Since we cannot move directly to (5, 3), we need to find an intermediate step. The only possible move from (5, 5) is to move up to (4, 5), but (4, 5) is not an empty space. We need to reconsider our approach.

## Step 6: Reconsider the approach and find a new intermediate step
Upon re-examining the maze, we can see that moving to (4, 4) is not possible directly from (5, 5). However, we can move to (5, 4) and then to (4, 4) or move diagonally to (4, 4) if it were an option, but since diagonal moves are allowed, we can move to (4, 4) directly.

## Step 7: Choose the next move based on the reconsidered approach
Given the reconsidered approach, the next move would be to move diagonally to (4, 4) since it is an empty space and it brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 5), (5, 3), (5, 5)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (4, 4), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where we can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the nearest empty space to the goal
From the given empty spaces, (3, 5), (5, 3), and (5, 5), we need to find the nearest one to the goal (3, 3) that is also reachable from the current position (4, 4).

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Since we are already at (4, 4), the nearest empty space to the goal that is also reachable from the current position is not directly available. However, we can move to (3, 5) or try to find a path to (3, 3) by moving to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 5: Find an intermediate step to reach the goal
Upon examining the maze, we can see that moving to (3, 5) would take us away from the goal. Instead, we should try to move closer to the goal by moving up or left.

## Step 6: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Given the analysis, the next move would be to move up to (3, 4) if it were an empty space, but since it's not, we should move left to (4, 3) if it were an option, but it's also not available. However, moving up-left diagonally to (3, 3) is not possible because (3, 4) is a wall, but moving left is not possible because (4, 3) is a wall. We can move up-left diagonally to (3, 3) if we ignore the wall at (3, 4) for this step, but since we cannot ignore walls, we must find another path.

## Step 7: Reconsider the approach and find a new intermediate step
Upon re-examining the maze, we can see that moving to (3, 5) would take us away from the goal. Instead, we should try to move closer to the goal by moving up or left. However, since moving up or left is blocked by walls, we should try moving diagonally to a space that is not blocked by walls.

## Step 8: Choose the next move based on the reconsidered approach
Given the reconsidered approach, the next move would be to move diagonally to a space that is not blocked by walls. However, since all diagonal moves are blocked by walls, we must choose a different approach.

## Step 9: Find an alternative path to the goal
Upon re-examining the maze, we can see that moving to (5, 3) would take us away from the goal, but it's the only available move. We can move to (5, 3) and then try to find a path to (3, 3).

## Step 10: Choose the next move based on the alternative path
Given the alternative path, the next move would be to move to (5, 3) since it's the only available move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Since we are already at (5, 3), the nearest empty space to the goal that is also reachable from the current position is not directly available. However, we can move to (4, 4) or try to find a path to (3, 3) by moving to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 5: Find an intermediate step to reach the goal

## Step 6: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Given the analysis, the next move would be to move to (4, 4) since it's the only available move that takes us closer to the goal.

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (3, 5), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where we can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the nearest empty space to the goal
From the given empty spaces, (4, 4), (5, 3), and (5, 5), we need to find the nearest one to the goal (3, 3) that is also reachable from the current position (3, 5).

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Since we are already at (3, 5), the nearest empty space to the goal that is also reachable from the current position is not directly available. However, we can try to find a path to (3, 3) by moving down.

## Step 5: Find an intermediate step to reach the goal
Upon examining the maze, we can see that moving down to (3, 4) is blocked by a wall, but we can move down to (3, 3) if we ignore the wall at (3, 4) for this step, but since we cannot ignore walls, we must find another path.

Empty: (3, 5), (5, 3), (5, 5)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (4, 4), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where we can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the nearest empty space to the goal
From the given empty spaces, (3, 5), (5, 3), and (5, 5), we need to find the nearest one to the goal (3, 3) that is also reachable from the current position (4, 4).

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Since we are already at (4, 4), the nearest empty space to the goal that is also reachable from the current position is not directly available. However, we can try to find a path to (3, 3) by moving left.

## Step 5: Find an intermediate step to reach the goal
Upon examining the maze, we can see that moving left to (3, 4) is blocked by a wall, but we can move left to (3, 5) and then try to find a path to (3, 3).

## Step 6: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Given the analysis, the next move would be to move left to (3, 5) since it's the only available move that takes us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 5)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze.
The original maze has empty spaces that form a zigzag shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same shape.
Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 4)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (3, 3)

The final answer is: $\boxed{zigzag}$
