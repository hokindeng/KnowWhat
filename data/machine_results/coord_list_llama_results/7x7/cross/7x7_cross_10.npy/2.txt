You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
The current player position is (5, 5). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, as long as the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the available empty spaces
The available empty spaces are (3, 5), (4, 4), and (5, 3). We need to find the closest empty space to the current position that will bring us closer to the goal position (3, 3).

## Step 4: Choose the next move
The closest empty space to the current position (5, 5) that will bring us closer to the goal position (3, 3) is (5, 3). This move is diagonal and is a valid move since it is an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 3)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (3, 5), (4, 4), and (5, 3). These points form a diagonal line from the top-right to the bottom-left.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a diagonal line.

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze, we will keep the same size (7x7) and create a new set of empty spaces that form a diagonal line. We will also ensure that the new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze.

## Step 4: Define the new set of empty spaces
The new set of empty spaces will be (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2). These points form a diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right.

## Step 5: Define the new set of walls
The new set of walls will be all the remaining points in the maze, excluding the empty spaces and the player and goal positions.

## Step 6: Define the new player and goal positions
The new player position will be (4, 2) and the new goal position will be (2, 4).

## Step 7: Encode the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal line}$
