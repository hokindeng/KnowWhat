You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (5, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and movement rules
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The player can move to any adjacent empty space, which includes up, down, left, right, and any diagonal direction.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and the goal position
The current player position is (3, 4), and the goal position is (5, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (3, 4), we need to examine the adjacent empty spaces to determine the possible next moves. The empty spaces are (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 1), and (6, 5).

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Since the goal is to reach (5, 2), we should prioritize moving towards the goal while avoiding walls. The most direct path would involve moving down and left. However, we must consider the available empty spaces and the walls that block certain paths.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal position, a reasonable next move would be to move down to (4, 4) is not an option since it's not listed as an empty space, so we look for the closest available empty space that brings us closer to the goal. Moving to (4, 3) is a viable option as it brings us closer to the goal position (5, 2) and is an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 4), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (5, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze layout and movement rules
The maze remains the same, with the same rules for movement.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and the goal position
The current player position is now (4, 3), and the goal position remains (5, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (4, 3), we need to examine the adjacent empty spaces to determine the possible next moves. The empty spaces are (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 4), (5, 4), (6, 1), and (6, 5).

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Since the goal is to reach (5, 2), we should prioritize moving towards the goal while avoiding walls. The most direct path would involve moving down and left. However, we must consider the available empty spaces and the walls that block certain paths.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal position, a reasonable next move would be to move down to (5, 3) is not an option since it's not listed as an empty space, but moving to (5, 4) is a viable option as it brings us closer to the goal position (5, 2) and is an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 4)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 1), and (6, 5). By examining these coordinates, we can see that the empty spaces form a zigzag or a winding path.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a similar winding path. We will place the empty spaces in a way that creates a recognizable zigzag shape.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (5, 2)

The final answer is: $\boxed{zigzag}$
