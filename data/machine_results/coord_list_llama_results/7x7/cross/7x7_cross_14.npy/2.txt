You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (5, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (3, 4), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the adjacent spaces
Looking at the maze, the adjacent spaces to the current position (3, 4) are:
- Up: (2, 4) - Wall
- Down: (4, 4) - Empty
- Left: (3, 3) - Wall
- Right: (3, 5) - Empty
- Diagonal up-left: (2, 3) - Wall
- Diagonal up-right: (2, 5) - Empty
- Diagonal down-left: (4, 3) - Empty
- Diagonal down-right: (4, 5) - Wall

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position is (5, 2), the best move would be to move diagonally down-left to (4, 3), as it brings the player closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 4), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (5, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (4, 3), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the adjacent spaces
Looking at the maze, the adjacent spaces to the current position (4, 3) are:
- Up: (3, 3) - Wall
- Down: (5, 3) - Wall
- Left: (4, 2) - Wall
- Right: (4, 4) - Wall
- Diagonal up-left: (3, 2) - Empty
- Diagonal up-right: (3, 4) - Empty (previous position)
- Diagonal down-left: (5, 2) - Goal
- Diagonal down-right: (5, 4) - Empty

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position is (5, 2), the best move would be to move diagonally down-left to (5, 2), as it directly reaches the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 2)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces that form a zigzag or a winding path, but upon closer inspection, it can be seen as a series of connected L-shapes or a rough diagonal line with deviations.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces
Given the description, the general shape can be named as a "Diagonal Zigzag" or more broadly, a "Winding Diagonal Path". However, for simplicity, let's refer to it as a "Diagonal Zigzag".

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure it has a similar diagonal zigzag pattern for the empty spaces, while not being an identical copy of the original maze.

## Step 4: Define the new maze
Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (5, 2)

However, this is the original maze. Let's create a truly new maze.

New Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
New Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 5)
New Player position: (3, 4)
New Goal: (5, 2)

This new maze maintains a similar diagonal zigzag pattern for the empty spaces but is not an identical copy of the original maze.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal Zigzag}$
