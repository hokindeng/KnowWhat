You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (5, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the rules for movement.
The maze is a 2D grid with specified walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The player can move to any adjacent empty space, which includes up, down, left, right, or any diagonal move.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and the goal position.
The current player position is (3, 4), and the goal position is (5, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves from the current player position.
Given the current player position (3, 4), we need to examine the adjacent spaces to determine which ones are empty and thus valid for the next move.

## Step 4: Determine the valid moves.
Looking at the maze, from position (3, 4), the valid moves would be to positions that are empty and adjacent. Since the maze's empty spaces are given, we can see that moving diagonally to (4, 3) is a valid move because (4, 3) is listed as an empty space.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the goal position.
Considering the goal position (5, 2), moving to (4, 3) brings us closer to the goal and is a valid move according to the maze's layout.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 4), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (5, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze and the player's position.
The player is currently at position (4, 3), and the goal is to reach position (5, 2).

## Step 2: Examine the possible moves from the current position.
From position (4, 3), we can consider moving up, down, left, right, or diagonally to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Identify the valid moves based on the maze's layout.
Given the maze's layout, moving directly to the goal is not possible because there is a wall or an obstacle in the way. However, we can move to a position that brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose a move that brings us closer to the goal.
Considering the goal position (5, 2), moving to position (5, 4) is not a direct path but is a valid move since (5, 4) is listed as an empty space. However, a more direct approach would be to move to a position that is closer to the goal in both the x and y coordinates.

## Step 5: Select the most appropriate move.
Given the constraints and the goal, moving to (5, 3) is not possible because (5, 3) is a wall. However, moving to (5, 4) is a valid move and brings us closer to the goal in terms of the x-coordinate.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (6, 1), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (5, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Evaluate the current position and the goal.
The player is currently at position (5, 4), and the goal is to reach position (5, 2).

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current position.
From position (5, 4), we can consider moving up, down, left, right, or diagonally to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Identify the valid moves based on the maze's layout.
Given the maze's layout, moving directly to the goal is not possible because there is a wall or an obstacle in the way. However, we can move to a position that brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose a move that brings us closer to the goal.
Considering the goal position (5, 2), moving down is not possible because it would take us away from the goal. Moving left or right is also not possible because there are walls in the way. However, moving up is a valid move and brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Select the most appropriate move.
Given the constraints and the goal, moving up to (5, 3) is not possible because (5, 3) is a wall. However, moving up to (5, 2) is not possible directly from (5, 4) because of the wall at (5, 3). We need to find an alternative route.

## Step 6: Re-evaluate the maze for an alternative route.
Upon re-evaluation, we can see that moving to (4, 3) and then finding a path from there could be an option. However, since we are already at (5, 4), we should look for a move that keeps us at the same x-coordinate (5) and moves us closer to the goal in the y-coordinate.

## Step 7: Choose an alternative move.
Given the constraints, moving to (4, 3) is a step backward. Instead, we should look for a move that keeps us at x-coordinate 5 and moves us closer to y-coordinate 2.

## Step 8: Select the most appropriate alternative move.
Considering the goal position (5, 2), we can move to (5, 3) if it were not a wall. Since (5, 3) is a wall, we need to find another path. Moving to (5, 1) is not possible directly, but we can try to move to a position that allows us to bypass the wall at (5, 3).

## Step 9: Final evaluation of possible moves.
Upon final evaluation, moving to (4, 4) is not a valid move because it would take us away from the goal. However, moving to (5, 3) is not possible because it is a wall. We need to find a move that bypasses the wall.

## Step 10: Choose the best available move.
Given the constraints, the best available move is to move to a position that allows us to bypass the wall at (5, 3) and move closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 4)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 1), and (6, 5). Upon examination, these spaces form a zigzag or a winding path.

## Step 2: Determine the name of the general shape.
Based on the arrangement of the empty spaces, the general shape can be described as a "zigzag" or "winding path." For the purpose of this task, we'll refer to it as a "zigzag."

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same size and shape.
To create a new maze with the same size and shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a recognizable zigzag pattern. We will place the empty spaces in a way that creates a winding path from the player's position to the goal.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze.
Here is the new maze with the empty spaces forming a zigzag pattern:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (5, 2)

The final answer is: $\boxed{zigzag}$
