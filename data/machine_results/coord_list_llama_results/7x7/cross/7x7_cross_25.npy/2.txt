You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (2, 3), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we need to check which of these moves are valid by ensuring the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine valid moves
Looking at the maze, the current position (2, 3) is an empty space. We can see that moving up to (1, 3) is not possible because (1, 3) is a wall. Moving down to (3, 3) is also not possible because (3, 3) is a wall. Moving left to (2, 2) is not possible because (2, 2) is a wall. Moving right to (2, 4) is not possible because (2, 4) is a wall. However, moving diagonally to (1, 4) is a valid move because (1, 4) is an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to the diagonally adjacent empty space (1, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (1, 4), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we need to check which of these moves are valid by ensuring the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine valid moves
Looking at the maze, the current position (1, 4) is an empty space. We can see that moving up to (0, 4) is not possible because (0, 4) is a wall. Moving down to (2, 4) is also not possible because (2, 4) is a wall. Moving left to (1, 3) is not possible because (1, 3) is a wall. Moving right to (1, 5) is not possible because (1, 5) is a wall. However, moving diagonally to (0, 5) is not possible because it's not a diagonal move from (1, 4) to (0, 5), but moving diagonally to (0, 3) is not a valid move since we are trying to get to (0, 5). But moving to (0, 5) is a valid move since it's adjacent to (1, 4) and is the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to the adjacent space (0, 5) which is the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(0, 5)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (0, 3), (1, 4), and (2, 5), and the player position is (2, 3) with the goal at (0, 5). The shape formed by these empty spaces is a diagonal line from bottom right to top left.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a diagonal line.

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a diagonal line from bottom right to top left. We can place the player position at (6, 0) and the goal at (4, 2), and add empty spaces at (5, 1), (4, 2), and (3, 3) to form the diagonal line.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Here is the new maze encoded in the same format as the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (5, 1), (4, 2), (3, 3), (2, 3)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (4, 2)

The final answer is: Diagonal line
