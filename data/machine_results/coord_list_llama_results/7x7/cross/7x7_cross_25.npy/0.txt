You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Analyze the given maze data
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

## Step 3: Determine the possible moves from the current player position
From the current player position (2, 3), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we need to avoid walls.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since the goal is to reach (0, 5), we should try to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. The closest empty space to the goal is (0, 3), but we cannot move directly to it because it is not adjacent to our current position. However, we can move to (1, 4) which is an empty space and closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Determine the coordinates of the next move
The coordinates of the next move are (1, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the current state of the maze
The current state of the maze shows the player position at (1, 4), and the goal is at (0, 5). We need to navigate from the current position to the goal while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current player position
From the current player position (1, 4), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we need to avoid walls.

Since the goal is to reach (0, 5), we should try to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. The closest empty space to the goal is (0, 3), but we cannot move directly to it because it is not adjacent to our current position. However, we can move to (0, 3) is not a good option, instead we can move to (2, 5) is not a good option either, but we can move to (0, 5) is not possible, so we can move to (2, 3) is not a good option, so we can move to (0, 4) is not possible, so we can move to (1, 3) is not possible, so we can move to (1, 5) is not possible, so we can move to (2, 4) is not possible.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (0, 3), (1, 4), and (2, 5), and the player position is at (2, 3) with the goal at (0, 5). The shape formed by these empty spaces is a diagonal line from the bottom right to the top left.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a diagonal line.

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same size and shape, we need to generate a new set of empty spaces that form a diagonal line from the bottom right to the top left.

## Step 4: Generate the new maze
Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (0, 2)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal line}$
