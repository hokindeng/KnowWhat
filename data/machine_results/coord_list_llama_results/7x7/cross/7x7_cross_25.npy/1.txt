You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Analyze the given maze data
The given maze data includes the coordinates of the walls, empty spaces, the current player position, and the goal position. The walls are located at various coordinates, and there are only three empty spaces: (0, 3), (1, 4), and (2, 5). The current player position is (2, 3), and the goal position is (0, 5).

## Step 3: Determine the possible moves from the current player position
From the current player position (2, 3), we can move to any adjacent empty space. Since there are no empty spaces directly above, below, to the left, or to the right of the current position, we need to consider diagonal moves. The only possible diagonal move is to the empty space at (1, 4).

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to the empty space at (1, 4), as it is the only possible move that brings us closer to the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the current state of the maze
The current state of the maze shows the updated player position at (1, 4) and the remaining empty spaces at (0, 3), (2, 3), and (2, 5). The goal position remains at (0, 5).

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current player position
From the current player position (1, 4), we can move to any adjacent empty space. Since there are no empty spaces directly above or below the current position, we need to consider horizontal and diagonal moves. The possible moves are to the empty space at (0, 3) or to the empty space at (2, 5).

## Step 3: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position is at (0, 5), moving to the empty space at (0, 3) would bring us closer to the goal. However, we need to consider the ultimate goal of reaching (0, 5), and moving to (0, 3) might not be the most direct path. On the other hand, moving to (2, 5) would put us in a position where we can potentially move diagonally to the goal. But since diagonal moves are allowed, we can also consider moving diagonally from (1, 4) to (0, 5) directly.

## Step 4: Choose the most direct path to the goal
Given the possibility of diagonal moves, the most direct path to the goal would be to move diagonally from (1, 4) to (0, 5).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(0, 5)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (0, 3), (1, 4), and (2, 5), and the player position is at (2, 3). The goal position is at (0, 5). The shape formed by these empty spaces can be described as a diagonal or a "staircase" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to maintain the same size and create a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. We will place the empty spaces in a way that forms a recognizable diagonal or "staircase" shape.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
The new maze will have the same size as the original maze. We will place the empty spaces at (0, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 4), and the player position will be at (2, 3). The goal position will be at (0, 4).

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
The new maze can be encoded as follows:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

The final answer is: 
(1) Diagonal or "staircase" shape
(2) Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)
