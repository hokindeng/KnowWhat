You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (2, 3), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, but only to empty spaces.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the nearest empty space to the goal
Since the goal is at (0, 5), we should try to move towards it. However, we need to find a path through the empty spaces. The nearest empty space to the current position that is also closer to the goal is (1, 4).

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to the empty space (1, 4), as it is the closest empty space to the current position that also moves towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (1, 4), and the goal is at position (0, 5). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (1, 4), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, but only to empty spaces.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the nearest empty space to the goal
Since the goal is at (0, 5), we should try to move towards it. However, we need to find a path through the empty spaces. The nearest empty space to the current position that is also closer to the goal is not directly available, but we can move to (0, 3) and then try to find a path to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to the empty space (0, 3), as it is the closest empty space to the current position that also moves towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(0, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (0, 3), and the goal is at position (0, 5). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (0, 3), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. However, there are no empty spaces directly above or below the current position that are not blocked by walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find an alternative path to the goal
Since we cannot move directly up or down, we need to find an alternative path. We can move to (1, 4) and then try to find a path to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to the empty space (1, 4), as it is the closest empty space to the current position that also moves towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (1, 4), and the goal is at position (0, 5). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (1, 4), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. However, there are no empty spaces directly above or below the current position that are not blocked by walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find an alternative path to the goal
Since we cannot move directly up or down, we need to find an alternative path. We can move to (2, 3) and then try to find a path to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to the empty space (2, 3), as it is the closest empty space to the current position that also moves towards the goal.

## Step 5: Consider the diagonal move to the goal
However, we can also consider a diagonal move to the goal. Since the goal is at (0, 5) and we are at (1, 4), we can move diagonally to (0, 5) if it is an empty space.

## Step 6: Check if the diagonal move is possible
Since the diagonal move to (0, 5) is not blocked by any walls, we can make this move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(0, 5)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (0, 3), (1, 4), and (2, 5), and the player position is at (2, 3) with the goal at (0, 5). The general shape formed by these empty spaces is a diagonal line.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same size and shape, we need to generate a new set of empty spaces that form a diagonal line. We can place the empty spaces at (0, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 4).

## Step 3: Ensure the new maze has a valid path from P to G
We need to ensure that the new maze has a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G). We can place the player position at (2, 2) and the goal at (0, 4).

## Step 4: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original
Here is the new maze encoded using the same format as the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 4)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal}$
