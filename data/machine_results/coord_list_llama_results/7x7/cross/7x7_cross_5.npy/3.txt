You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The current player position is (5, 6). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, but only to empty spaces. We need to examine the adjacent positions to determine which moves are valid.

## Step 3: Examine the adjacent positions
The adjacent positions to (5, 6) are (4, 6), (6, 6), (5, 5), (5, 7), (4, 5), (6, 5), (4, 7), and (6, 7). However, we need to consider only the positions that are within the maze boundaries and are empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the valid moves
From the given empty spaces, (4, 5) is a valid move since it is an empty space and is adjacent to the current player position.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Based on the valid moves, we choose the move that brings us closer to the goal position (3, 4). Moving to (4, 5) is a step in the right direction.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The current player position is (4, 5). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, but only to empty spaces. We need to examine the adjacent positions to determine which moves are valid.

## Step 3: Examine the adjacent positions
The adjacent positions to (4, 5) are (3, 5), (5, 5), (4, 4), (4, 6), (3, 4), (5, 4), (3, 6), and (5, 6). However, we need to consider only the positions that are within the maze boundaries and are empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the valid moves
From the given empty spaces, (5, 4) is a valid move since it is an empty space and is adjacent to the current player position. Additionally, (3, 6) is also a valid move, but it would be moving away from the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Based on the valid moves, we choose the move that brings us closer to the goal position (3, 4). Moving to (5, 4) is a step in the right direction, but we should also consider moving to (3, 5) if it were an empty space. However, since (3, 5) is a wall, we cannot move there. Another option is to move to (4, 4), but it is also a wall. Therefore, moving to (5, 4) is the best option among the valid moves.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

The adjacent positions to (5, 4) are (4, 4), (6, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (4, 3), (6, 3), (4, 5), and (6, 5). However, we need to consider only the positions that are within the maze boundaries and are empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the valid moves
From the given empty spaces, (4, 5) is a valid move since it is an empty space and is adjacent to the current player position. Additionally, we can also consider moving to (5, 5), but it is a wall. Another option is to move to (4, 4), but it is also a wall. However, we can move to (4, 3) is not a valid move since it is a wall, but (4, 5) is a valid move.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Based on the valid moves, we choose the move that brings us closer to the goal position (3, 4). Moving to (4, 5) is a valid move, but it would be moving away from the goal. However, we can move to (4, 5) and then try to find another path to the goal.

The current player position is (3, 6). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, but only to empty spaces. We need to examine the adjacent positions to determine which moves are valid.

## Step 3: Examine the adjacent positions
The adjacent positions to (3, 6) are (2, 6), (4, 6), (3, 5), (3, 7), (2, 5), (4, 5), (2, 7), and (4, 7). However, we need to consider only the positions that are within the maze boundaries and are empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the valid moves
From the given empty spaces, (4, 5) is a valid move since it is an empty space and is adjacent to the current player position.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Based on the valid moves, we choose the move that brings us closer to the goal position (3, 4). Moving to (4, 5) is a valid move, and it brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze.
The original maze has empty spaces that form a zigzag shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same shape.
Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 4)
