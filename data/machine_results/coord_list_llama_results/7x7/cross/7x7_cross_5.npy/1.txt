You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (5, 6), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where we can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the available empty spaces
From the given empty spaces, (3, 6), (4, 5), and (5, 4), we need to find the closest one to the current player position (5, 6) that is also a valid move.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since the goal is to move towards the goal position (3, 4), we should choose the empty space that is closest to the goal and also a valid move from the current position. The closest empty space is (4, 5), which is a valid move diagonally up and to the left from the current position (5, 6).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (4, 5), and the goal is to reach position (3, 4). We need to analyze the available empty spaces to determine the next move.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From the current position (4, 5), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the available empty spaces
The available empty spaces are (3, 6), (5, 4), and (5, 6). We need to find the closest one to the goal position (3, 4) that is also a valid move from the current position.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since the goal is to move towards the goal position (3, 4), we should choose the empty space that is closest to the goal and also a valid move from the current position. The closest empty space is not directly available, but we can move to (5, 4) which is a valid move diagonally down and to the right from the current position (4, 5), and then reassess the next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6)

## Step 3: Analyze the available empty spaces
The available empty spaces are (3, 6), (4, 5), and (5, 6). We need to find the closest one to the goal position (3, 4) that is also a valid move from the current position.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since the goal is to move towards the goal position (3, 4), we should choose the empty space that is closest to the goal and also a valid move from the current position. The closest empty space is (4, 5), which is a valid move diagonally up and to the left from the current position (5, 4).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (4, 5), and the goal is to reach position (3, 4). We need to analyze the available empty spaces to determine the next move.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position

The available empty spaces are (3, 6), (5, 4), and (5, 6). We need to find the closest one to the goal position (3, 4) that is also a valid move from the current position.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since the goal is to move towards the goal position (3, 4), we should choose the empty space that is closest to the goal and also a valid move from the current position. However, none of the available empty spaces are directly adjacent to the goal. We need to move to a position that will allow us to reach the goal in the next move. We can move to (5, 4) which is a valid move diagonally down and to the right from the current position (4, 5), but this will not bring us closer to the goal. Alternatively, we can move to (3, 6) which is a valid move diagonally up and to the left from the current position (4, 5), and then reassess the next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 6)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

## Step 3: Analyze the available empty spaces
The available empty spaces are (4, 5), (5, 4), and (5, 6). However, since we are already at column 3, we should focus on moving down to reach the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since the goal is to move towards the goal position (3, 4), we should move down to the next available empty space. However, there are no empty spaces directly below the current position. We need to move to a position that will allow us to reach the goal in the next move. We can move to (4, 5) which is a valid move diagonally down and to the right from the current position (3, 6), but this will not bring us closer to the goal. Alternatively, we can move to (5, 4) which is a valid move diagonally down and to the right from the current position (3, 6), but this will also not bring us closer to the goal. We can move to (5, 6) which is a valid move diagonally down and to the right from the current position (3, 6), but this will also not bring us closer to the goal. However, we can move down to (3, 5) which is not an available empty space, but we can move down to (3, 4) which is the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 5) is not available, so we move to (3, 4) is not possible from here, so we move to (4, 5)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze.
The original maze has empty spaces at (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), and (5, 6). The general shape formed by these empty spaces is a diagonal line with a small branch.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape.
To create a new maze with the same shape, we can rotate the original maze by 90 degrees clockwise and then adjust the positions of the empty spaces to form a similar diagonal line with a small branch.

## Step 3: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original.
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (5, 3)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal line with a small branch}$
