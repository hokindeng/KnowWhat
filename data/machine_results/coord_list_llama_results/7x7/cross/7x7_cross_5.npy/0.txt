You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (5, 6), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we will examine the neighboring positions.

## Step 3: Examine the neighboring positions
The neighboring positions of (5, 6) are (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 6), (6, 5), (4, 7) is out of bounds, (5, 7) is out of bounds, and (6, 7) is out of bounds. We will check which of these positions are empty spaces.

## Step 4: Check for empty spaces among the neighboring positions
From the given empty spaces, (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), we can see that (4, 5) is an empty space and is adjacent to the current player position.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Since (4, 5) is an empty space and is adjacent to the current player position, we will choose this as our next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (4, 5), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we will examine the neighboring positions.

## Step 3: Examine the neighboring positions
The neighboring positions of (4, 5) are (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 6). We will check which of these positions are empty spaces.

## Step 4: Check for empty spaces among the neighboring positions
From the given empty spaces, (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6), we can see that (5, 4) and (5, 6) are not adjacent to the current position in a way that would be a valid next move, but (3, 6) is not a good choice since it would be moving away from the goal. However, (3, 4) is adjacent to the current position and is closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Since (3, 4) is adjacent to the current position and is closer to the goal, we will choose this as our next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 4)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), and the goal is at (3, 4). The shape formed by these empty spaces is a diagonal line or a "diagonal corridor".

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will place the empty spaces in a diagonal line. We will also ensure that the new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze and that there is a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (5, 3)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal}$
