You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (5, 1), (5, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the rules for movement.
The maze is a 2D grid with specified walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The player can move to any adjacent empty space, which includes up, down, left, right, and any diagonal direction.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and the goal position.
The current player position is (4, 2), and the goal position is (6, 0).

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves from the current player position.
Given the current player position (4, 2), we need to examine the adjacent spaces to determine which ones are empty and thus valid for the next move.

## Step 4: Determine the valid moves.
Looking at the maze, from position (4, 2), the valid moves would be to positions that are empty and adjacent. However, since the maze details are provided in a list format, we need to cross-reference the current position with the lists of walls and empty spaces to identify valid moves.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the goal position.
Since the goal is to reach (6, 0), we should prioritize moves that bring us closer to this position. Given the constraints of the maze and the current position, we need to find a path that navigates around the walls and through the empty spaces efficiently.

## Step 6: Given the constraints and the goal, the optimal next move would be to move towards the goal while avoiding walls.
Considering the maze layout and the goal position, the best next move from (4, 2) would be to move to a position that is closer to the goal and is not blocked by walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The original maze's empty spaces form a shape that resembles a zigzag or a winding path, but given the constraints and the layout, it's more accurate to describe it as a series of connected, staggered, or offset corridors.

## Step 2: Determine the characteristics of the shape to replicate in the new maze.
To replicate the shape, the new maze should have empty spaces that form a series of connected corridors with a similar staggered or offset pattern. This means the empty spaces should not form a straight line or a simple curve but rather a more complex path that requires navigation around the walls.

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same size and shape characteristics.
Given the original maze's size (7x7) and the need to replicate the shape of the empty spaces, the new maze will have a similar layout but with different wall and empty space configurations.

## Step 4: Define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position for the new maze.
To ensure the new maze is not an identical copy of the original and meets the criteria, the positions of the walls, empty spaces, player, and goal will be adjusted while maintaining the overall shape and size.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original.
The new maze will be encoded with lists for walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position.

The final answer is: 

**Shape:** Staggered or Offset Corridors

**New Maze:**

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5)
