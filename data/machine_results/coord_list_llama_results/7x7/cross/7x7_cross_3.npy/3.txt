You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (5, 1), (5, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the rules for movement.
The maze is a 2D grid with specified walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The player can move to any adjacent empty space, which includes up, down, left, right, and any diagonal direction.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and the goal position.
The current player position is (4, 2), and the goal position is (6, 0).

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves from the current player position.
Given the current player position (4, 2), we need to examine the adjacent spaces to determine which ones are empty and thus valid for the next move.

## Step 4: Determine the valid moves.
Looking at the maze, from position (4, 2), the valid moves would be to positions that are empty and adjacent. Since the maze details are provided in a list format, we need to cross-reference the current position with the lists of walls and empty spaces to find a suitable next step.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the goal position.
Considering the goal is to reach (6, 0), we should prioritize moves that bring us closer to this position while avoiding walls and navigating through empty spaces.

## Step 6: Select the optimal next move.
Given the constraints and the goal, the optimal next move from (4, 2) would be to move towards the goal while staying on the path. Since direct diagonal movement is allowed, we should aim to get closer to the goal in both the x and y coordinates if possible.

## Step 7: Identify the specific coordinates of the next move.
Considering the empty spaces and the goal, a logical next step from (4, 2) would be to move to a position that is closer to the goal and is listed as an empty space. Given the layout, moving to (5, 1) or (5, 3) could be considered, but since (5, 1) is directly on the path towards the goal and is an empty space, it would be the preferred next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze and the player's position.
The player is currently at position (5, 1), and the goal is to reach position (6, 0).

## Step 2: Examine the possible moves from the current position.
Given the current position (5, 1), we need to look at the adjacent spaces to determine which ones are empty and thus valid for the next move.

## Step 3: Identify the valid moves based on the maze layout.
Considering the maze layout and the current position, the valid moves would be to positions that are empty and adjacent. Since the goal is close, we should prioritize moves that bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the goal position.
Since the goal is to reach (6, 0), and we are currently at (5, 1), the most direct move towards the goal would be to move down and to the right, but since we cannot move through walls, we need to find an empty space that brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Select the optimal next move.
Given the constraints and the goal, the optimal next move from (5, 1) would be to move to a position that is closer to the goal and is listed as an empty space. However, since moving directly to (6, 0) is not possible due to the wall at (5, 0) and (6, 1), we need to find an alternative route.

## Step 6: Identify the specific coordinates of the next move.
Considering the empty spaces and the goal, a logical next step from (5, 1) would be to move to (6, 4) is not a good option since it moves away from the goal in the y-coordinate. However, moving to (5, 0) is not possible due to the wall. The best option seems to be moving to (5, 3) or trying to find a path around the walls to reach the goal.

## Step 7: Re-evaluate the maze for a path around the walls.
Upon re-evaluation, moving to (5, 3) does not bring us closer to the goal in a significant way. We need to think about moving around the walls to reach the goal. Given the layout, there seems to be no direct path to the goal without moving through walls or empty spaces that are not listed.

## Step 8: Consider moving to a position that allows for future moves towards the goal.
Given the constraints, one possible move is to position (5, 3), which is an empty space. Although it does not directly bring us closer to the goal, it keeps the option open for future moves that could navigate around the walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 3)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The original maze's empty spaces form a shape that resembles a zigzag or a winding path, but more specifically, it can be described as a series of connected "L" shapes or a stepped path.

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same shape formed by its empty spaces.
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to replicate the stepped or zigzag pattern of empty spaces while ensuring the maze is not an identical copy of the original and includes a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Determine the size and layout of the new maze.
The new maze will have the same size as the original, which is 7x7.

## Step 4: Create the new maze with the specified shape.
We will place the empty spaces in a stepped or zigzag pattern, ensuring there is a path from the player's position (P) to the goal (G). We will also ensure that the maze is not identical to the original.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original.
We will list the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position in the same format as the original maze.

The final answer is: 

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (6, 0)
