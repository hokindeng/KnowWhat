You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (5, 1), (5, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and given the constraints of the format, I'll describe the approach and provide the next move directly.

Given the maze's layout, the player's position (4, 2), and the goal (6, 0), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal. The BFS algorithm explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, making it suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this maze.

However, since the maze allows diagonal movements, we'll consider movements in eight directions (up, down, left, right, and four diagonals) for each empty space.

Given the player's current position (4, 2) and the goal (6, 0), and considering the walls and empty spaces, the next move should aim to get closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

The next move would be to move diagonally down and to the right, but since that's not directly possible due to the wall at (5, 3) and the need to navigate around it, we'll aim to move in a way that gets us closer to the goal while navigating through the empty spaces.

Considering the empty spaces and the goal, a viable next move from (4, 2) would be to move to (5, 1), as it's an empty space and gets us closer to the goal, albeit indirectly. This move sets us up for further navigation towards the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (5, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze, the player's position (5, 1), and the goal (6, 0), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

Since the goal is directly to the right and down from the current position, but there's a wall at (6, 1), we need to find a way around it. However, there's no direct path down from (5, 1) to (6, 0) without going through a wall.

Considering the empty spaces, a viable next move from (5, 1) would be to move to (5, 3), as it's an empty space and gets us closer to the goal, albeit indirectly. This move sets us up for further navigation towards the goal.

However, a more optimal move would be to move to (6, 4) and then try to navigate down from there, but since we can't move directly to (6, 4) from (5, 1), we need to find an alternative route.

Given the constraints, the next best move would be to move to (5, 3), which is an empty space and gets us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (5, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or more specifically, a "staircase" shape, with a series of connected L-shapes.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (6, 6)

This new maze has a similar staircase shape formed by the empty spaces, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The player can navigate from the starting position (4, 0) to the goal (6, 6) through the empty spaces.
