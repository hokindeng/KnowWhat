You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (5, 1), (5, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move towards the goal while avoiding walls.

First, let's analyze the maze and the goal:

- The goal is at (6, 0).
- The player's current position is (4, 2).

Given the walls and empty spaces, the most direct path to the goal, avoiding walls and considering diagonal moves, would be to move down and right. However, we need to navigate through the empty spaces efficiently.

A possible first move, considering the constraints and aiming to move closer to the goal, would be to move down to (5, 2). However, since (5, 2) is not listed as an empty space and is actually a wall, we need to reconsider our approach.

Given the empty spaces and the goal, a viable first move would be to move to (5, 1), as it is an empty space and moves us closer to the goal in a diagonal direction, albeit indirectly. This move sets us up for further navigation towards the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (5, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze, we need to navigate from (5, 1) to the goal at (6, 0).

Since we are at (5, 1) and the goal is at (6, 0), we should aim to move down and right. However, we need to avoid walls and navigate through empty spaces.

A possible next move would be to move down to (6, 1), but since (6, 1) is a wall, we cannot move there.

Considering the empty spaces and the goal, a viable next move would be to move to (5, 0), but since (5, 0) is a wall, we cannot move there either.

However, we can move to (5, 3), which is an empty space and moves us closer to the right side of the maze, albeit not directly towards the goal. From (5, 3), we can reassess our next move.

Therefore, my next move would be to (5, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape, but more specifically, it resembles a "broken diagonal" or a "stepped diagonal" shape, where the path moves diagonally from the starting point to the goal, but with interruptions and steps.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape characteristics:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (6, 0)

This new maze has a similar "stepped diagonal" shape, with a path that moves diagonally from the starting point to the goal, but with interruptions and steps. The empty spaces form a recognizable diagonal shape, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces compared to the original maze.
