You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (2, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The current player position is (4, 5). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we need to check which of these moves are valid by ensuring they do not lead into a wall and are within the maze boundaries.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine valid moves
Given the maze layout, the valid moves from (4, 5) would be those that do not result in hitting a wall or moving outside the maze. Since the goal is to reach (2, 5), we should prioritize moves that bring us closer to this position.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (2, 5) and the current player position (4, 5), the most direct move would be to move up or diagonally up-left to get closer to the goal. However, we must ensure that the chosen move does not lead into a wall.

## Step 5: Select the optimal next move
Given the constraints and the objective to move closer to the goal, the optimal next move from (4, 5) would be to move diagonally up-left to (3, 4), as this position is empty and brings us closer to the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (4, 3), (4, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The current player position is (3, 4), and the goal position is (2, 5). We need to navigate from the current position to the goal while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
From (3, 4), the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, provided they do not lead into a wall or outside the maze boundaries.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine valid moves
Given the maze layout, we should prioritize moves that bring us closer to the goal position (2, 5). Moving up or diagonally up-left seems promising, but we must ensure these moves are valid.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position and the current player position, moving diagonally up-left to (2, 5) would be ideal if it were a valid move. However, we need to check if this move is possible given the maze's constraints.

## Step 5: Select the optimal next move
Upon closer inspection, moving directly to (2, 5) is not possible due to the wall at (2, 4). Therefore, the optimal next move from (3, 4) would be to move up to (3, 5), as this position is empty and brings us closer to the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 5)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 3), and the goal is at (2, 5). The shape formed by these empty spaces can be described as a diagonal or slanted line, but given the constraints and the goal, it resembles more of an "L" shape when considering the path from the player position to the goal.

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a recognizable "L" shape. This means we should have a vertical line of empty spaces and a horizontal line of empty spaces that intersect, forming the "L" shape.

## Step 3: Determine the size and layout of the new maze
The original maze is a 7x7 grid. We will maintain the same size for the new maze to ensure it meets the criteria.

## Step 4: Place the empty spaces to form the "L" shape
To form the "L" shape, we can place empty spaces vertically from (2, 2) to (2, 5) and horizontally from (2, 2) to (5, 2). This creates an "L" shape with the corner at (2, 2).

## Step 5: Add the player position and the goal
The player position (P) can be placed at (5, 2), and the goal (G) can be placed at (2, 5) to ensure a valid path exists through the empty spaces.

## Step 6: Encode the new maze
Walls: All coordinates not listed as empty spaces.
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (2, 5)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L}$
