You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (2, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (4, 5), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we need to check which of these moves are valid by ensuring the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine valid moves
Looking at the maze, we can see that the current player position (4, 5) is surrounded by walls on all sides except for the empty space at (4, 3) and potentially moving diagonally or horizontally to other empty spaces if they exist within the adjacent positions.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Since the goal is to reach (2, 5), we should prioritize moving towards the goal. However, given the constraints of the maze and the current position, the most direct move towards the goal that also avoids walls would be to move to an empty space that brings us closer to the goal or sets us up for a future move towards the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the constraints and the objective, the best next move from (4, 5) would be to move to (4, 3), as it is the only directly accessible empty space from the current position that also moves us closer to the goal or at least does not move us further away.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 3), which form a diagonal line or a "V" shape when considering the direction from the player position to the goal.

## Step 2: Determine the name of the general shape
Given the positions of the empty spaces, the general shape can be described as a diagonal or "V" shape. However, considering the context of maze paths, it's more accurate to describe it as a diagonal or angled path rather than a perfect geometric shape like a "V". For simplicity, we'll refer to it as a diagonal path.

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a diagonal or angled path from the player position to the goal. We will place the empty spaces in a way that they are not identical to the original maze but still form a recognizable diagonal path.

## Step 4: Define the new maze
The new maze will have the same size as the original (7x7) and will include a valid path from P to G. We will place the empty spaces to form a diagonal path, ensuring it is not an identical copy of the original maze.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (2, 5)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal}$
