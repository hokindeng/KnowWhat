You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (2, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (4, 5), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space, we will examine the coordinates around the current position.

## Step 3: Examine the coordinates around the current position
Looking at the coordinates around (4, 5), we find that moving up to (3, 5) is not possible because (3, 5) is a wall. Moving down to (5, 5) is also not possible because (5, 5) is a wall. Moving left to (4, 4) is possible because (4, 4) is an empty space. Moving right to (4, 6) is not possible because (4, 6) is a wall. Moving diagonally to (3, 4) is possible because (3, 4) is an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the possible moves, we can choose to move left to (4, 4) or diagonally to (3, 4). Since moving diagonally to (3, 4) brings us closer to the goal position (2, 5) and is a valid move, we will choose this move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (4, 3), (4, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (3, 4), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space, we will examine the coordinates around the current position.

## Step 3: Examine the coordinates around the current position
Looking at the coordinates around (3, 4), we find that moving up to (2, 4) is not possible because (2, 4) is a wall. Moving down to (4, 4) is not possible because (4, 4) is the current position of the player. Moving left to (3, 3) is not possible because (3, 3) is a wall. Moving right to (3, 5) is not possible because (3, 5) is a wall. Moving diagonally to (2, 3) is possible because (2, 3) is an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the possible moves, we can choose to move diagonally to (2, 3). Since moving diagonally to (2, 3) brings us closer to the goal position (2, 5) and is a valid move, we will choose this move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Moving left to (2, 2) is not possible because (2, 2) is a wall. Moving right to (2, 4) is not possible because (2, 4) is a wall. Moving diagonally to (3, 4) is possible because (3, 4) is an empty space, but it is not the most direct path to the goal. Moving up-right to (1, 4) is not possible because (1, 4) is a wall. Moving down-right to (3, 4) is possible, but moving right to (2, 4) is not possible.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at coordinates (2, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 3), (4, 5). These empty spaces form a general shape that can be recognized as an "L-shape" with an additional isolated point.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same size and shape
To generate a new maze, we will create a new set of empty spaces that form the same L-shape with an additional isolated point. We will also ensure that the new maze has a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
The new maze will have the same size as the original maze, with walls at the same coordinates. The empty spaces will be at new coordinates that form the L-shape with an additional isolated point.

## Step 4: Specify the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (5, 5)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$
