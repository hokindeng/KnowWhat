You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (2, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (4, 5), we need to identify the possible moves. We can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, we can see that the current player position (4, 5) is surrounded by walls on all sides except for the space (4, 3) and (3, 4). However, since we are trying to reach the goal position (2, 5), we should prioritize moving towards the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the best move
Since we cannot move directly to the goal position, we need to find a path that will bring us closer to the goal. The space (4, 3) is not directly on the path to the goal, but moving to (3, 4) would bring us closer to the goal position.

## Step 5: Determine the coordinates of the next move
Based on the analysis, the best move would be to move to the space (3, 4), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (4, 3), (4, 5)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at coordinates (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), and (4, 5). These spaces form a general shape that resembles a diagonal or slanted line, but more specifically, it can be described as an "L-shape" or a "bent" shape, but given the context and the movement restrictions, it's more accurate to describe it as a "diagonal" or "slanted" path. However, considering the movement restrictions and the overall layout, it's more fitting to describe the shape as a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape, but given the simplicity of the path, it's more accurate to describe it as a "diagonal" or "slanted" path. However, considering the simplicity of the path and the movement restrictions, it's more fitting to describe the shape as a "diagonal" or "slanted" path, but given the overall layout, it's more accurate to describe it as a "staircase" shape.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same shape
To generate a new maze with the same shape, we need to create a new set of empty spaces that form a "staircase" shape. We will place the new empty spaces in a way that creates a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
The new maze will have the same size as the original maze. We will place the empty spaces at coordinates (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 5). The player position will be at (1, 2), and the goal position will be at (4, 5).

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
The new maze can be encoded as follows:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 5)

The final answer is: $\boxed{staircase}$
