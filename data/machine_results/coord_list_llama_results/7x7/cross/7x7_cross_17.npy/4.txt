You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (3, 3), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we will examine the surrounding coordinates.

## Step 3: Examine the surrounding coordinates
Looking at the coordinates around (3, 3), we find that the only possible move is to the right, as the other directions are blocked by walls or are not empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Based on the examination of the surrounding coordinates, the next move would be to the right of the current player position, which is (3, 4). However, since (3, 4) is a wall, we need to reconsider our options. Upon re-examining the maze, we find that the only viable move from (3, 3) is actually to (3, 5) but since we can't move diagonally in one step in this specific problem context, we need to find an alternative path.

## Step 5: Re-evaluate the maze for an alternative path
Given the constraints of the maze and the movement rules, we need to find a path that involves moving to an adjacent empty space. Since (3, 4) is a wall, we look for another empty space that is adjacent to (3, 3). However, there are no other empty spaces directly adjacent to (3, 3) except for moving towards the goal indirectly by utilizing the empty spaces provided.

## Step 6: Choose the correct path
Since we cannot move directly to (3, 5) and (3, 4) is a wall, we should look for an alternative route that involves moving to an empty space that is not directly adjacent to the goal but leads us closer to it. However, given the initial problem statement, it seems we overlooked the direct path to the goal due to the diagonal movement restriction. The correct approach is to move towards the goal by utilizing the given empty spaces as a path.

## Step 7: Correct the approach based on the problem's movement rules
Given the movement rules allow for diagonal movement, the initial assessment that we cannot move diagonally was incorrect. Thus, the correct next move from (3, 3) to reach the goal (3, 5) directly is indeed possible and is the most straightforward path.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 4) is incorrect due to the wall, so the correct move is actually (3, 5) but since we can move diagonally, the correct next step is actually (3, 4) is not possible, so we move to (2, 4) or (4, 4) if they were empty and adjacent, but given the direct diagonal path is the goal, the answer should reflect moving towards the goal directly if possible or the closest empty space to it. However, following the format strictly as requested, I must provide a numerical answer which doesn't fit this solution path perfectly. Given the constraints and the mistake in the reasoning process about diagonal movement, the answer should reflect the closest move towards the goal or an empty space. Since the format demands a numerical answer and the question asks for coordinates, the correct interpretation under the strict format would be to provide the goal as the answer since it's the destination and the question asks for the next move which would ideally be the goal if directly reachable or the closest empty space to it. Thus, the correct numerical representation of the goal as the answer would be (3, 5).}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at coordinates (1, 3), (1, 5), and (2, 4). These spaces form a rough "L" shape, but given the constraints and the goal position, it's more accurate to describe the path as a straight line with a single deviation or a "bent line" due to the limited number of empty spaces.

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a recognizable "bent line" or a path that deviates once from a straight line. The new maze should be of the same size (7x7) and include a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Determine the new empty spaces
Given the shape we are aiming for, we can place the empty spaces in a way that they form a bent line. For example, we can place the empty spaces at coordinates (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 4). This arrangement forms a bent line that is not a straight copy of the original maze.

## Step 4: Define the new maze
The new maze will have the same size and format as the original. The walls will be placed at all coordinates not specified as empty spaces or the player/goal positions.

## Step 5: Specify the new maze
Walls: All coordinates not specified as empty spaces or the player/goal positions.
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

The final answer is: 
(1) Bent line
(2) Walls: All coordinates not specified as empty spaces or the player/goal positions.
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)
