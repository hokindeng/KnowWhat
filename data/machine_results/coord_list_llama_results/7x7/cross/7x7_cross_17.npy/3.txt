You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we need to navigate from the player position (3, 3) to the goal position (3, 5) while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces. Given the constraints and the layout of the maze, we'll plan a step-by-step path.

First, let's analyze the maze layout and the positions of the walls, empty spaces, the player, and the goal:

- The player starts at (3, 3).
- The goal is at (3, 5).
- The empty spaces that can be moved into are (1, 3), (1, 5), and (2, 4), but given the player's starting position and the goal, the most relevant empty space to consider initially is (2, 4) because it's closer to the player's starting position and is on a more direct path towards the goal.

However, since the goal is directly above the player's starting position and there are no walls between the player and the goal on the y-axis, the most straightforward path would be to move directly upwards. But, given the maze's constraints and the fact that we can move diagonally, we should first aim to get closer to the goal by moving upwards and then adjust our path as necessary.

Given the current setup, the optimal first move would be to move diagonally or directly towards the goal. However, since moving directly up is not possible due to the wall at (3, 4), we need to find an alternative route. The description initially overlooked the direct path due to the complexity of the maze's wall layout. Given the walls' positions, a direct move upwards is actually possible because there's no wall at (3, 4) according to the provided list of walls.

Therefore, the best next move, considering the goal's proximity and the maze's layout, is to move directly up from (3, 3) to (3, 4), and then continue upwards if possible. However, since the direct path to the goal is not blocked by walls as initially thought, we can aim to move directly towards the goal.

The next move should be to (3, 4), as it's the most direct step towards the goal without hitting a wall, and then reassess from there. However, considering the goal is at (3, 5) and there's no wall at (3, 4) or (3, 5) according to the provided information, the optimal move is actually to move directly to the goal if possible or to the closest empty space that leads directly to the goal.

Given the misunderstanding in the initial analysis regarding the direct path to the goal, the correct next move, aiming for the most straightforward path to the goal, would be to move to (3, 4) and then directly to (3, 5) if the maze allows it, which it does based on the provided wall layout.

So, the next move is to (3, 4), but considering the goal's position and the absence of walls in the direct path, the actual aim is to get as close as possible to (3, 5) in the next move, which means moving directly to (3, 4) is the first step in a potentially direct path to the goal.

However, since the goal is directly reachable without needing to move to (3, 4) first due to the absence of walls in the direct path, the optimal next move is actually to move directly to the goal position if the maze's rules allow for diagonal movement or if there's a direct path, which seems to be the case given the initial misunderstanding.

Given the direct path is clear, the next move should aim directly for the goal, but since we need to follow the rules and the maze allows for direct movement to the goal without hitting a wall, the correct approach is to move directly towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 4)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Disconnected Islands" or more specifically, a set of isolated points or "dots" since the empty spaces are not connected to each other.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces form a shape that is recognizable as a set of isolated points or "dots", similar to the original maze.
