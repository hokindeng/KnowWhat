You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (3, 3), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space, we will examine the coordinates around the current position.

## Step 3: Examine the coordinates around the current position
Looking at the coordinates around (3, 3), we find that the possible moves are limited due to the presence of walls. The only available empty space adjacent to the current position is (3, 5), which is also the goal position, but we cannot move directly there because there is a wall at (3, 4) blocking the direct path.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal position, the best next move would be to move to a position that brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls. However, given the constraints of the maze and the current position, the only viable move is to move to (2, 4), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal position indirectly by potentially allowing us to navigate around the walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (2, 4), and the goal is to reach position (3, 5). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From position (2, 4), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space. However, we need to consider the walls and the available empty spaces to determine the best next move.

## Step 3: Examine the coordinates around the current position
Looking at the coordinates around (2, 4), we find that the only available empty space that brings us closer to the goal is (3, 3), but we cannot move directly to the goal position (3, 5) because there is a wall at (3, 4) blocking the direct path.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal position, the best next move would be to move to position (3, 3), which brings us closer to the goal and potentially allows us to navigate around the walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (3, 3), and the goal is to reach position (3, 5). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From position (3, 3), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space. However, we need to consider the walls and the available empty spaces to determine the best next move.

## Step 3: Examine the coordinates around the current position
Looking at the coordinates around (3, 3), we find that the only available empty space that brings us closer to the goal is (3, 5), but we cannot move directly there because there is a wall at (3, 4) blocking the direct path. However, we can move to (2, 4) and then potentially find a path to (3, 5).

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal position, the best next move would be to move to position (2, 4), which brings us closer to the goal and potentially allows us to navigate around the walls.

However, since we already know that moving to (2, 4) and then back to (3, 3) does not help, we should look for alternative paths. Given the constraints of the maze, we can try moving to (1, 3) and then see if we can find a path to (3, 5).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 3)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at coordinates (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 4), and (3, 3), and the goal is at (3, 5). By examining these coordinates, we can see that the empty spaces form a rough "L" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will place the empty spaces in a way that forms a recognizable "L" shape. We will also ensure that the new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze and that there is a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 5)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L}$
