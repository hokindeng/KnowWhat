You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (4, 3), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where we can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the shortest path to the goal
Looking at the maze, we can see that the goal position is (4, 1). Since we can move diagonally, we should try to move in a way that gets us closer to the goal position.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
From the current player position (4, 3), we can move to (4, 2) or (3, 2) as these are the only adjacent empty spaces. However, moving to (4, 2) would not bring us closer to the goal, so we should move to (3, 2) as it is a step towards the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has been updated to reflect the new player position at (3, 2). We need to analyze the current state to determine the next move.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
From the current player position (3, 2), we can move to adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the shortest path to the goal
Looking at the maze, we can see that the goal position is (4, 1). Since we are at (3, 2), we should try to move in a way that gets us closer to the goal position.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
From the current player position (3, 2), we can move to (4, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 1) or (4, 3) as these are the adjacent empty spaces or previously visited spaces. However, moving to (2, 3) or (4, 3) would not bring us closer to the goal, and moving to (4, 2) would put us in a wall, so we should move to (3, 1) or (4, 3) then (4, 2) is not possible so (3, 1) is the best option.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 1)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), and (4, 3). These spaces form a general shape that can be described as a "zigzag" or more specifically, a "staircase" shape, but given the constraints and the path it forms, it is more accurate to describe it as a "bent" or "L-shaped" path.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a recognizable "L-shaped" path. We will place the empty spaces in a way that creates a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
The new maze will have the same size as the original maze. We will place the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position in a way that meets the criteria.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shaped}$
