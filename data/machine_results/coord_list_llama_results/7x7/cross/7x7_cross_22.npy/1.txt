You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (4, 3), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space, we will examine each direction.

## Step 3: Examine the possible moves in each direction
- Up: (3, 3) is a wall, so we cannot move up.
- Down: (5, 3) is a wall, so we cannot move down.
- Left: (4, 2) is an empty space, so we can move left.
- Right: (4, 4) is a wall, so we cannot move right.
- Diagonals: (3, 2), (3, 4), (5, 2), and (5, 4) are the possible diagonal moves. However, only (3, 2) is an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the possible moves, we can move left to (4, 2) or diagonally to (3, 2). However, since the goal is to reach (4, 1), moving left to (4, 2) is a more direct approach towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 2)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 2). These points form a diagonal line, but given the constraints of the maze and the movement rules, it's more accurate to describe the shape as a "zigzag" or a "bent line" since direct diagonal movement is possible but the path's overall shape due to the walls is more zigzag-like.

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same shape for the empty spaces
To create a new maze with the same shape for the empty spaces, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a recognizable zigzag or bent line pattern. We will place the empty spaces in a way that they are not in a straight line but still allow for a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G).

## Step 3: Determine the new maze's layout
Given the original maze's size (7x7), we will create a new maze with the same size. We will place the player position (P) and the goal (G) in new locations but ensure they are connected by a path that forms a zigzag shape through the empty spaces.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (2, 1)

The final answer is: $\boxed{zigzag}$
