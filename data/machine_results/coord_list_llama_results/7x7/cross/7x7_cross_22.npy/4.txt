You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Analyze the given maze data
The given maze data includes the coordinates of the walls, empty spaces, the current player position, and the goal position. The walls are located at various coordinates, and there are only three empty spaces: (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 2). The current player position is (4, 3), and the goal position is (4, 1).

## Step 3: Determine the possible moves from the current player position
From the current player position (4, 3), we can move to any adjacent empty space. However, since there are no empty spaces directly adjacent to (4, 3) except for moving towards the goal, we should aim to move closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Given the goal position is (4, 1) and the current position is (4, 3), the most direct move towards the goal would be to move up, but since we can only move to empty spaces and there are walls and no direct empty space above, we need to find an alternative route. The closest empty space that can lead us towards the goal is (3, 2), but moving directly to it is not possible due to the wall at (4, 2). However, considering diagonal moves are allowed and there's an empty space at (2, 3) which could potentially lead to a path to the goal, we should consider moving towards it or finding a path that utilizes the available empty spaces efficiently.

## Step 5: Decide on the optimal next move considering the constraints
Given the constraints and the need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and utilizing the available empty spaces, the optimal next move from (4, 3) would be to move towards the empty space that could potentially lead to a path to the goal. However, since moving directly to (2, 3) or (3, 2) is not straightforward due to the walls, and considering we need to provide a step-by-step solution, we should look for a move that sets us up for the next step towards the goal.

## Step 6: Realize the oversight in step 5 and correct the approach
Upon reevaluation, considering the direct path to the goal is blocked by walls and the available empty spaces, the best approach is to move towards the goal as directly as possible while avoiding walls. Given the layout, moving diagonally or to an adjacent empty space that sets up for a future move towards the goal is ideal. However, the direct path to the goal (4, 1) from (4, 3) is blocked, and the empty spaces provided do not offer a straightforward path. The goal is to move closer to (4, 1) from (4, 3), but given the constraints, we must acknowledge the direct move towards the goal is not possible without intersecting walls.

## Step 7: Correct the approach based on the maze's specifics
Given the specifics of the maze and the goal to reach (4, 1) from (4, 3), and acknowledging the error in assuming a direct path or an easy diagonal move to an empty space, the correct approach is to find a path that navigates around the walls. However, the provided empty spaces and the maze's layout do not offer a simple next step without considering a path that involves moving away from the goal initially to navigate around the walls.

## Step 8: Re-evaluate the maze for a viable path
Upon re-evaluation, considering the maze's layout and the goal, a viable path involves moving to a position that sets up for navigating around the walls towards the goal. Given the constraints and the layout, the initial analysis overlooked the complexity of navigating through the given empty spaces to reach the goal.

## Step 9: Determine the correct next move based on the maze's layout
Given the maze's layout and the need to navigate around walls to reach the goal, the correct next move involves considering the empty spaces provided and how they can be used to navigate towards the goal. However, the direct path to the goal is blocked, and the empty spaces do not provide a straightforward solution without considering a more complex path.

## Step 10: Realize the need for a more complex path
The maze requires a more complex path to navigate from the current player position to the goal, involving moves that may not directly approach the goal initially but set up for future moves that can navigate around the walls.

## Step 11: Identify a potential complex path
A potential path involves moving to an empty space that allows for future moves towards the goal, considering the maze

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 2). These spaces form a rough "L" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape of empty spaces
To create a new maze with the same shape of empty spaces, we will maintain the "L" shape but adjust the positions of the empty spaces.

## Step 3: Determine the new positions of the empty spaces
We will place the new empty spaces at (1, 2), (1, 4), and (2, 3) to form an "L" shape.

## Step 4: Define the new maze
The new maze will have the same size as the original maze (7x7) and will include the new empty spaces. The walls will be adjusted to ensure a valid path from P to G.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

The final answer is: L
