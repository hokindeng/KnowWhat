You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (4, 3), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the shortest path to the goal
From the given maze layout, we can see that the goal position is (4, 1). Since the player is currently at (4, 3), the shortest path would be to move left and then up to reach the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to move left from the current position (4, 3) to the adjacent empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 2)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at coordinates (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 2). These spaces form a diagonal line, but given the constraints of the maze and the positions of the walls, it's more accurate to describe the shape as a "zigzag" or a "bent line" since the path does not form a perfect diagonal due to the presence of walls.

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a recognizable zigzag or bent line. We will place the empty spaces in a way that they are not in a straight line but still allow for a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

## Step 3: Determine the coordinates for the new maze
Given the size of the original maze (7x7), we will create a new maze with the same size. We will place the player position (P) and the goal position (G) in a way that they are connected by a zigzag path formed by the empty spaces.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Here is the new maze with the empty spaces forming a zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (5, 4)

The final answer is: There is no specific numerical answer for this problem as it involves describing a shape and generating a new maze based on that shape.
