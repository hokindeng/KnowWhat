You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (4, 3) and the empty spaces, we can identify the possible moves. The player can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the empty spaces, we see that the closest empty space to the goal position (4, 1) is (4, 3) itself, which is the current player position, and (3, 2). However, since we need to move towards the goal, we should aim to move towards the empty space that brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (4, 1) and the available empty spaces, the best next move would be to move diagonally or directly towards the goal if possible. However, since there are no direct empty spaces leading to the goal from the current position, we need to find an alternative route. The closest empty space that can lead us towards the goal is (3, 2), but moving there directly would not bring us closer to the goal. We should look for a move that brings us closer to the goal or sets us up for a future move that does.

## Step 5: Determine the optimal next move
Given the constraints and the layout, moving to (3, 2) does not directly bring us closer to the goal but is the only available move that could potentially set us up for a future move towards the goal. However, upon closer inspection, we realize that moving to (3, 2) does not provide a clear path to the goal due to the walls blocking direct access. We must reconsider our approach based on the available empty spaces and the goal's position.

## Step 6: Re-evaluate the maze for a viable path
Upon re-evaluation, considering the walls and the empty spaces, a direct path to the goal is not immediately apparent from the current position. However, we must utilize the given empty spaces to navigate towards the goal. Given the initial analysis might have overlooked the direct implications of the maze's layout on possible moves, a correct approach involves considering each step's impact on reaching the goal, acknowledging the oversight in the initial steps.

## Step 7: Correct the approach based on the maze's layout
Given the maze's layout and the goal to reach (4, 1) from (4, 3), and considering the empty spaces provided, a viable path involves moving through the available empty spaces in a way that brings us closer to the goal. However, the initial analysis failed to correctly identify a viable next step that aligns with the goal of reaching (4, 1) efficiently.

## Step 8: Finalize the next move based on corrected understanding
Considering the need to correct the approach and the misunderstanding in the initial analysis, the focus should be on identifying a move that aligns with the constraints of the maze and the objective of reaching the goal. Given the layout and the goal, a move that brings us closer or sets us up for a future move towards the goal is essential.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (3, 2), and the goal is to reach position (4, 1). We need to analyze the available empty spaces and the walls to determine the best next move.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From position (3, 2), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space. However, we need to avoid walls and prioritize moves that bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the empty spaces, we see that the closest empty space to the goal position (4, 1) is (4, 3). However, since we are currently at (3, 2), we should aim to move towards the goal by utilizing the available empty spaces.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (4, 1) and the available empty spaces, the best next move would be to move towards the goal. Since we cannot move directly to the goal, we should look for a move that brings us closer to the goal or sets us up for a future move that does.

## Step 5: Determine the optimal next move
Given the constraints and the layout, moving to (4, 3) would bring us closer to the goal. However, we need to consider if this move is possible and if it sets us up for a future move towards the goal.

## Step 6: Finalize the next move
Considering the need to move towards the goal and the available empty spaces, the optimal next move is to move to (4, 3), which brings us closer to the goal and sets us up for a future move towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), and (4, 3). These empty spaces form a general shape that can be recognized as a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same shape
To generate a new maze with the same shape, we need to create a new set of empty spaces that form an L-shape or a bent corridor. We will place the new empty spaces in a way that creates a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
The new maze will have the same size as the original maze, with 7 rows and 7 columns. We will place the new empty spaces as follows:
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4)
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$
