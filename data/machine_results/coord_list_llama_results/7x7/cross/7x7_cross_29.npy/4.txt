You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (4, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (6, 3) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are to adjacent empty spaces. Since the maze allows diagonal moves, we need to consider all eight directions (up, down, left, right, and four diagonals).

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and their proximity to the goal
The empty spaces are (4, 3), (5, 4), and (6, 5). The goal position is (4, 5). We need to find the shortest path to the goal while avoiding walls.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the empty spaces and the goal position, the best next move would be to move diagonally up-left from (6, 3) to (5, 4), as it brings us closer to the goal position (4, 5) and avoids walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 3), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (4, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (5, 4), and the goal is at position (4, 5). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (5, 4) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are to adjacent empty spaces. Since the maze allows diagonal moves, we need to consider all eight directions (up, down, left, right, and four diagonals).

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and their proximity to the goal
The empty spaces are (4, 3), (6, 3), and (6, 5). The goal position is (4, 5). We need to find the shortest path to the goal while avoiding walls.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the empty spaces and the goal position, the best next move would be to move diagonally up-left from (5, 4) to (4, 5), as it directly reaches the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 5)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze are (4, 3), (5, 4), and (6, 5). These spaces form a diagonal line or a "slash" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to generate a new set of empty spaces that form a diagonal line or a "slash" shape. We will keep the same size as the original maze.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (3, 2)

The final answer is: $\boxed{slash}$
