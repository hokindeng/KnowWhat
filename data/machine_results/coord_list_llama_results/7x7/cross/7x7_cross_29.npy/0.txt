You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (4, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (6, 3) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or diagonals to adjacent empty spaces. However, since the maze layout is mostly blocked by walls, the feasible moves are limited.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find a path to the goal
Looking at the maze, the goal position (4, 5) is located above and to the left of the current player position. Since the maze is mostly blocked by walls, the path to the goal will likely involve moving diagonally or horizontally to reach the empty spaces that can lead to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Considering the empty spaces and the goal position, the next move should be to move diagonally up and to the left to reach the empty space (5, 4), which is closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 3), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (4, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is now at position (5, 4), and the goal is at position (4, 5). The maze layout and the empty spaces have been updated.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
From the current position (5, 4), the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or diagonals to adjacent empty spaces. However, since the maze layout is mostly blocked by walls, the feasible moves are limited.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find a path to the goal
Looking at the maze, the goal position (4, 5) is located above and to the left of the current player position. Since the maze is mostly blocked by walls, the path to the goal will likely involve moving diagonally or horizontally to reach the empty spaces that can lead to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Considering the empty spaces and the goal position, the next move should be to move diagonally up and to the left to reach the goal position (4, 5), but since there is no empty space that allows a direct diagonal move, the next best move is to move up to the empty space that is closest to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 5)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (4, 3), (5, 4), and (6, 5), and the goal is at (4, 5). The shape formed by these empty spaces can be described as a diagonal or slanted line.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to design a new set of empty spaces that form a diagonal or slanted line. We will keep the same size as the original maze.

## Step 3: Define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal for the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (3, 5)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal}$
