You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (4, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (6, 3) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and their proximity to the goal
The empty spaces are (4, 3), (5, 4), and (6, 5). The goal position is (4, 5). To move closer to the goal, we should prioritize moving towards the empty space that is closest to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the next move based on the analysis
Since the goal is (4, 5) and one of the empty spaces is (5, 4), which is closer to the goal than the current position (6, 3), the best next move would be to move diagonally up-left to (5, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 3), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (4, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is now at position (5, 4), and the goal is at position (4, 5). The empty spaces are (4, 3), (6, 3), and (6, 5).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (5, 4) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and their proximity to the goal
The closest empty space to the goal (4, 5) is (4, 3), which is directly below the goal. However, moving to (4, 3) would not directly lead to the goal. The best move would be to move up-left to a position that is closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the next move based on the analysis
Since the goal is (4, 5) and moving directly to the left is blocked by a wall, the best next move would be to move up-left diagonally to (4, 5), but since that is not possible due to the wall at (4, 4), the next best move is to move up to (5, 5) and then reassess.

However, since (5, 5) is a wall, we must choose an alternative. The alternative is to move left to (4, 4) is not possible due to the wall, so we move up to the closest available empty space or a space that leads us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is now at position (4, 3), and the goal is at position (4, 5). The empty spaces are (5, 4), (6, 3), and (6, 5).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (4, 3) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and their proximity to the goal
The closest empty space to the goal (4, 5) is not directly accessible due to the wall at (4, 4). However, moving up to (4, 4) is not possible, so we need to find an alternative route.

## Step 4: Determine the next move based on the analysis
Since the goal is (4, 5) and moving directly up is blocked by a wall, the best next move would be to move right to (5, 3) is not possible since it is a wall, so we move right to the closest available empty space or a space that leads us closer to the goal.

However, since moving right is not possible, we must choose an alternative. The alternative is to move down to (4, 2) is not possible due to the wall, so we move down to the closest available empty space or a space that leads us closer to the goal.

The alternative is to move right to (5, 3) is not possible, so we move right to (5, 4) which is an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 4)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (4, 3), (5, 4), and (6, 5), and the goal is at (4, 5). The path from the player position (6, 3) to the goal (4, 5) forms a general shape that can be described as an "L-shape" or a "corner" shape.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same size and shape
To generate a new maze with the same shape, we need to create a new set of empty spaces that form an L-shape or a corner shape. We will keep the same size as the original maze.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
The new maze will have the following empty spaces: (2, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 5). The player position will be at (2, 3), and the goal will be at (4, 5). The walls will be placed to form a valid path from the player position to the goal.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
The new maze can be encoded as follows:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 5)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$
