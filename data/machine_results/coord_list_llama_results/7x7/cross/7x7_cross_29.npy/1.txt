You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (4, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (6, 3) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and their proximity to the goal
The empty spaces are (4, 3), (5, 4), and (6, 5). The goal position is (4, 5). The closest empty space to the goal is (5, 4), but it's not directly reachable from the current player position. The empty space (4, 3) is directly reachable and is closer to the goal than the current position.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Considering the analysis in Step 3, the best next move is to move to the empty space (4, 3), as it brings the player closer to the goal and is a valid move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze are (4, 3), (5, 4), and (6, 5). These points form a diagonal line from the bottom right to the top left, but considering the context of the maze and the movement restrictions, it's more accurate to describe the shape as a "diagonal corridor" or simply a diagonal line. However, given the constraints of the maze and the movement rules, a more fitting description would be a "zigzag" or "staircase" shape, as the player must move in a zigzag pattern to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same shape formed by the empty spaces
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a recognizable zigzag or staircase pattern. The new maze should have the same size as the original (7x7) and include a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position for the new maze
Walls: To create a zigzag pattern, we'll place walls to block direct horizontal and vertical movements, forcing the player to move diagonally or in a zigzag pattern.
Empty spaces: We'll place empty spaces to form a zigzag pattern, ensuring that the player can move from P to G.
Player position: We'll place the player position at the bottom right corner, similar to the original maze.
Goal position: We'll place the goal position at the top left corner, similar to the original maze.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty spaces: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 5)
Goal: (0, 1)

The final answer is: There is no specific numerical answer to this problem, as it requires a descriptive and encoded response.
