You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (4, 4) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are to adjacent empty spaces. Since the goal is to reach (2, 2), we should prioritize moving towards that direction.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and their proximity to the goal
The empty spaces are (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2). Among these, (4, 2) is the closest to the current player position and also moves in the general direction towards the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Given the analysis, the best next move is to (4, 2) as it moves closer to the goal and is an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 2)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2). These points form a diagonal line from the top-right to the bottom-left, but given the constraints and the goal, it seems the path is intended to guide the player in a somewhat diagonal or curved manner towards the goal. However, with only three points, it's more accurate to describe the shape as a "diagonal line" or a "straight line with a diagonal orientation" rather than a curve. For simplicity, we'll consider it as a "diagonal line."

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same shape for the empty spaces
To create a new maze with the same shape (a diagonal line) for the empty spaces, we need to ensure that the empty spaces are aligned diagonally. We also need to ensure that the maze is not an identical copy of the original and that there is a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Determine the coordinates for the new maze's walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal
Given the original maze's size (7x7), we will maintain the same size for the new maze. We will place the player position (P) and the goal (G) in different locations but ensure they are connected by a diagonal line of empty spaces. The walls will be placed to avoid direct paths and to ensure the maze is challenging but solvable.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
For the new maze, let's place the player position at (6, 0) and the goal at (0, 6). The empty spaces will form a diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right. We will adjust the positions of the walls accordingly.

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (0, 6)

The final answer is: There is no specific numerical answer for this problem as it involves describing a shape and generating a new maze based on that shape.
