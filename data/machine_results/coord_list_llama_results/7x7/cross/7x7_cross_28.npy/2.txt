You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
The current player position is (4, 4). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, as long as the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and their proximity to the goal
The empty spaces are (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2). The goal position is (2, 2). We need to find the shortest path to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Since the goal is at (2, 2), we should try to move closer to it. The closest empty space to the goal is (2, 4), but we cannot move directly to it because it is not adjacent to our current position. However, we can move to (3, 3), which is closer to the goal than our current position.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to (3, 3), as it is the closest empty space to the goal that we can reach from our current position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The current player position is (3, 3), and the goal position is (2, 2).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
The possible moves from the current position (3, 3) are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, as long as the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and their proximity to the goal
The empty spaces are (2, 4), (4, 2), and (4, 4). The goal position is (2, 2). We need to find the shortest path to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Since the goal is at (2, 2), we should try to move closer to it. The closest empty space to the goal that we can reach from our current position is not directly available, but we can move to (4, 2), which is closer to the goal than our current position in terms of horizontal distance, although it's not the most direct path.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
However, considering the goal's position and the available empty spaces, moving to (4, 2) might not be the most efficient path. A more efficient path would be to try to move closer to the goal by moving up and left. Unfortunately, the space directly above our current position is a wall, and the space to the left is also a wall. Therefore, we should reconsider our options.

## Step 6: Reconsider the options
Given the constraints, we should look for an alternative path. Moving to (4, 2) is still an option, but it's not the most direct path. We should also consider moving to (2, 4) if possible, but it's not directly reachable from our current position.

## Step 7: Final decision
Considering the available options and the goal's position, we should try to move closer to the goal by moving up and left, but since those spaces are walls, we should move to the closest empty space that can potentially lead us to the goal. However, since we cannot move directly to (2, 2) or any space that would bring us closer in a straight line due to the walls, we must choose between the available empty spaces. Moving to (4, 2) is the most viable option given the current state of the maze.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Moving down from (2, 4) to (2, 3) is not possible because (2, 3) is a wall. However, we can move down from (2, 4) to (2, 2) if we consider the goal as a valid move.

## Step 6: Consider the goal as a valid move
Since the goal is at (2, 2) and it's a valid move, we can move down from (2, 4) to (2, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 2)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2), and the goal is at (2, 2). The path from the player position to the goal forms a general shape that can be described as a "L-shape" or a "corner" shape.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same shape
To generate a new maze with the same shape, we need to create a new set of empty spaces that form an L-shape or a corner shape. We will keep the same size as the original maze.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
The new maze will have the following empty spaces: (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), and (4, 4). The player position will be at (4, 4), and the goal will be at (1, 3).

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
The new maze can be encoded as follows:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (1, 3)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$
