You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (4, 4), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the closest empty space to the goal
From the given empty spaces, (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2), we need to find the closest one to the goal position (2, 2) that is also reachable from the current player position (4, 4).

## Step 4: Determine the next move
The closest empty space to the goal position that is also reachable from the current player position is (4, 2). However, we need to move to an adjacent empty space. Since (4, 2) is two spaces away from the current position, we can move diagonally to (4, 2) but first, we need to move to an adjacent empty space. Unfortunately, there are no adjacent empty spaces to (4, 4) that are directly reachable. We need to reconsider our approach.

## Step 5: Reconsider the approach
Upon re-examining the maze, we realize that we need to find a path that involves moving to an adjacent empty space first. The closest empty space to the current player position (4, 4) is (4, 2), but we cannot move there directly. We need to find an alternative route.

## Step 6: Find an alternative route
Since we cannot move directly to (4, 2), we need to find another empty space that is adjacent to the current player position. However, there are no adjacent empty spaces to (4, 4). We need to move to the closest empty space that is reachable, which is (3, 3).

## Step 7: Determine the next move
The next move is to move to the empty space (3, 3), which is adjacent to the current player position (4, 4) in a diagonal direction.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (3, 3), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the closest empty space to the goal
From the given empty spaces, (2, 4), (4, 2), and (4, 4), we need to find the closest one to the goal position (2, 2) that is also reachable from the current player position (3, 3).

## Step 4: Determine the next move
The closest empty space to the goal position that is also reachable from the current player position is (2, 4). However, we need to move to an adjacent empty space. Since (2, 4) is two spaces away from the current position, we can move diagonally to (2, 4) but first, we need to move to an adjacent empty space. Unfortunately, there are no adjacent empty spaces to (3, 3) that are directly reachable except for moving back to (4, 4) or moving to a new empty space that is closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Find an alternative route
Since we cannot move directly to (2, 4), we need to find another empty space that is adjacent to the current player position. However, there are no adjacent empty spaces to (3, 3) that are closer to the goal except for moving back to (4, 4). We need to move to the closest empty space that is reachable and closer to the goal.

## Step 6: Determine the next move
The next move is to move to the empty space (2, 4), which is two spaces away from the current player position (3, 3) in a diagonal direction. However, since we cannot move diagonally to (2, 4) directly, we need to move to an adjacent empty space first. Unfortunately, there are no adjacent empty spaces to (3, 3) that are directly reachable except for moving back to (4, 4). We need to reconsider our approach.

## Step 7: Reconsider the approach
Upon re-examining the maze, we realize that we need to find a path that involves moving to an adjacent empty space first. The closest empty space to the current player position (3, 3) is (4, 4), but we cannot move to (2, 2) from there. We need to find an alternative route.

## Step 8: Find an alternative route
Since we cannot move directly to (2, 4), we need to find another empty space that is adjacent to the current player position. However, there are no adjacent empty spaces to (3, 3) that are directly reachable except for moving back to (4, 4). We need to move to the closest empty space that is reachable and closer to the goal.

## Step 9: Determine the next move
The next move is to move to the empty space (4, 4), which is adjacent to the current player position (3, 3) in a diagonal direction.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2). These empty spaces form a general shape that can be recognized as a diagonal or a "V" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same size and shape, we need to generate a new set of empty spaces that form a diagonal or "V" shape. We will place the new empty spaces at (1, 5), (2, 4), and (3, 3).

## Step 3: Ensure the new maze has a valid path from P to G
We need to ensure that the new maze has a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G). We will place the player position at (3, 3) and the goal position at (1, 1).

## Step 4: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original
Here is the new maze encoded using the same format as the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal}$
