You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (4, 4) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are to adjacent empty spaces. Since the goal is to reach (2, 2), we should prioritize moving towards that direction.

## Step 3: Determine the best next move
Looking at the empty spaces and the goal position, the best next move from (4, 4) would be to move towards the empty space that is closest to the goal. The empty space (4, 2) is a possible move, as it brings us closer to the goal position (2, 2).

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to the empty space (4, 2), as it is the closest empty space to the goal position and it is a valid move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 2)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2). These points form a diagonal line from the top-right to the bottom-left, but given the constraints and the goal, it seems more like a "L" shape or a bent path.

## Step 2: Determine the characteristics of the shape to replicate in the new maze
To replicate the "L" shape or bent path, the new maze should have empty spaces that form a similar shape, allowing for a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we can rotate the original shape or create a new set of coordinates that form a similar "L" shape or bent path. Let's create a new set of coordinates.

## Step 4: Define the new maze
The new maze will have the same size as the original maze (7x7). We will keep the same player position (P) at (4, 4) and the same goal position (G) at (2, 2). The new empty spaces will form an "L" shape or bent path.

## Step 5: Specify the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 3), (3, 5)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L}$
