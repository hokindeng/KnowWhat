You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (3, 2), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where we can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, but we must ensure the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the nearest empty space to the goal
Since the goal is at (5, 0), we should try to move in a direction that brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls. Looking at the maze, moving down from (3, 2) is not possible due to walls, and moving directly to the right is also blocked by walls.

## Step 4: Determine the best initial move
Considering the goal's position and the layout of the maze, the best initial move from (3, 2) would be to move diagonally down and to the right if possible, or to find an alternative path that gets us closer to the goal. However, given the constraints of the maze, the most direct path towards the goal from (3, 2) involves moving to an empty space that is not directly blocked by walls.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the constraints and the goal to move closer to (5, 0), the next best move from (3, 2) is to move to (4, 1), as it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (4, 1), and the goal is at position (5, 0). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the current position
From (4, 1), we can consider moving up, down, left, right, or diagonally to an adjacent empty space. However, we must ensure that the destination is not a wall.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the best path to the goal
Given the goal's position at (5, 0), the most direct path would involve moving down and to the right. However, we need to navigate around the walls to reach the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the maze layout and the goal's position, the best next move from (4, 1) would be to move down to (5, 1) and then find a way to move left to (5, 0). However, since (5, 1) is a wall, we need to find an alternative path.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the constraints and the goal to move closer to (5, 0), the next best move from (4, 1) is to move to (3, 0), as it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal position, albeit indirectly. From there, we can reassess the path to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 0)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the maze layout and the goal's position, the best next move from (3, 0) would be to move right to (4, 0), but since (4, 0) is a wall, we need to find an alternative path.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the constraints and the goal to move closer to (5, 0), the next best move from (3, 0) is to move up to (3, 1), but since (3, 1) is a wall, we need to find another alternative path. The next best move from (3, 0) is to move to (4, 1), as it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (5, 2), and the goal is at position (5, 0). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the current position
From (5, 2), we can consider moving up, down, left, right, or diagonally to an adjacent empty space. However, we must ensure that the destination is not a wall.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the best path to the goal
Given the goal's position at (5, 0), the most direct path would involve moving down.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the maze layout and the goal's position, the best next move from (5, 2) would be to move down to (5, 1), but since (5, 1) is a wall, we need to find an alternative path.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the constraints and the goal to move closer to (5, 0), the next best move from (5, 2) is to move down to (5, 0) is not possible, so we need to move left or right to find a path. However, moving left or right would take us away from the goal. Since we cannot move down to (5, 1) or (5, 0) directly, we need to find another path. But since there is no other path, we need to move to a position that will allow us to move down to (5, 0) in the future.

## Step 6: Re-evaluate the maze
Upon re-evaluation, we realize that we made an incorrect assumption about the maze. We should have moved to a position that would allow us to move down to (5, 0) in the future.

## Step 7: Choose the correct next move
Given the constraints and the goal to move closer to (5, 0), the correct next move from (5, 2) is actually to move to a position that will allow us to move down to (5, 0) in the future. However, since there is no such position, we need to move to the only available empty space that is not a wall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 1)}$

## Step 6: Re-evaluate the maze
However, we have already been to (5, 2) and moving there again would not bring us closer to the goal. We need to find another path.

## Step 7: Choose the correct next move
Given the constraints and the goal to move closer to (5, 0), the correct next move from (4, 1) is actually to move to a position that will allow us to move down to (5, 0) in the future. However, since there is no such position, we need to move to the only available empty space that is not a wall.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the constraints and the goal to move closer to (5, 0), the next best move from (3, 0) is to move to (4, 1), as it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (4, 1), and the goal is at position (5, 0). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves from the current position
From (4, 1), we can consider moving up, down, left, right, or diagonally to an adjacent empty space. However, we must ensure that the destination is not a wall.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the best path to the goal
Given the goal's position at (5, 0), the most direct path would involve moving right and then down.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the maze layout and the goal's position, the best next move from (4, 1) would be to move right to (5, 1), but since (5, 1) is a wall, we need to find an alternative path.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the constraints and the goal to move closer to (5, 0), the next best move from (4, 1) is to move to (5, 2), as it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal position.

## Step 6: Re-evaluate the maze
However, we have already been to (5, 2) and moving there again would not bring us closer to the goal. We need to find another path.

## Step 7: Choose the correct next move
Given the constraints and the goal to move closer to (5, 0), the correct next move from (4, 1) is actually to move to a position that will allow us to move down to (5, 0) in the future. However, since there is no such position, we need to move to the only available empty space that is not a wall.

## Step 8: Final evaluation
Upon final evaluation, we realize that we need to move to a position that will allow us to move down to (5, 0) in the future. However, since there is no such position, we need to move to the only available empty space that is not a wall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 2)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze.
The original maze has empty spaces that form a zigzag path.

## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same shape.
Here is a new maze with the same size and shape as the original maze:


Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (5, 0)

The final answer is: $\boxed{zigzag}$
