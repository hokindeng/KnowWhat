You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (3, 2), we need to identify the possible moves. We can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, the possible moves from the current position (3, 2) are:
- Up: (2, 2) is a wall, so we cannot move up.
- Down: (4, 2) is an empty space, so we can move down.
- Left: (3, 1) is a wall, so we cannot move left.
- Right: (3, 3) is a wall, so we cannot move right.
- Diagonally: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), and (4, 3) are the possible diagonal moves. However, (2, 1) and (2, 3) are walls, and (4, 3) is a wall. Only (4, 1) is an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the best move
Considering the possible moves, moving down to (4, 2) or diagonally to (4, 1) are the options. However, moving diagonally to (4, 1) brings us closer to the goal position (5, 0) and also opens up more possibilities for the next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (4, 1), we need to identify the possible moves. We can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, the possible moves from the current position (4, 1) are:
- Up: (3, 1) is a wall, so we cannot move up.
- Down: (5, 1) is a wall, so we cannot move down.
- Left: (4, 0) is a wall, so we cannot move left.
- Right: (4, 2) is an empty space, but moving right does not bring us closer to the goal.
- Diagonally: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 0), and (5, 2) are the possible diagonal moves. However, (3, 0) and (3, 2) are not closer to the goal, and (5, 2) is not closer to the goal. Only (5, 0) is a diagonal move that brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the best move
Considering the possible moves, moving diagonally to (5, 0) is the best option as it brings us directly to the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 0)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 2), and the goal position is at (5, 0). The shape formed by these empty spaces is a diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right, but considering the movement restrictions and the goal, it can be seen as a diagonal path with a slight deviation. However, given the constraints and the movement from (3, 2) to (4, 1) and then to (5, 0), it resembles more of a diagonal or a "L" shape with a diagonal component.

## Step 2: Determine the name of the general shape
Given the analysis, the general shape formed by the empty spaces can be described as a diagonal or "L" shape with a diagonal component. However, for simplicity and clarity, we can consider it as an "L" shape.

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form an "L" shape. We will place the empty spaces in a way that they are not identical to the original maze but still form an "L" shape.

## Step 4: Define the new maze
The new maze will have the same size as the original maze. We will place the empty spaces at (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), and (5, 0). The player position will be at (2, 3), and the goal position will be at (5, 0).

## Step 5: Encode the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (5, 0)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L}$
