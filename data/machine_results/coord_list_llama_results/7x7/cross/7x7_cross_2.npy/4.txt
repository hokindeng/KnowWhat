You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (3, 2) and the empty spaces, we can identify the possible moves. Since we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space, we need to examine the coordinates of the empty spaces to determine the possible moves.

## Step 3: Examine the empty spaces to determine the possible moves
The empty spaces are (3, 0), (4, 1), and (5, 2). From the current position (3, 2), we can move to (3, 0) or (4, 1) as these are the only adjacent empty spaces.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the goal position
The goal position is (5, 0). To move closer to the goal, we should choose the move that brings us closer to the goal position. Moving to (4, 1) brings us closer to the goal position than moving to (3, 0).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (4, 1) and the empty spaces, we can identify the possible moves. Since we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space, we need to examine the coordinates of the empty spaces to determine the possible moves.

## Step 3: Examine the empty spaces to determine the possible moves
The empty spaces are (3, 0), (3, 2), and (5, 2). From the current position (4, 1), we can move to (3, 0) or (3, 2) as these are the only adjacent empty spaces that are not blocked by walls.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the goal position
The goal position is (5, 0). To move closer to the goal, we should choose the move that brings us closer to the goal position. Moving to (3, 0) brings us closer to the goal position than moving to (3, 2), but it also moves us away from the x-coordinate of the goal. However, moving to (3, 2) does not bring us closer to the goal position. Since we cannot move directly to (5, 0) from the current position, we should move to (3, 0) and then reassess our next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 0)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Since we cannot move directly to (5, 0) from the current position, we should move to (5, 2) and then reassess our next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Since we cannot move directly to (5, 0) from the current position, we should try to move down from the current position.

## Step 5: Try to move down from the current position
Since we can move down from the current position (5, 2) to (5, 1) and then to (5, 0), we should try to move down.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 2), (3, 2), and (4, 1) at different points in time. These empty spaces form a diagonal line from the bottom left to the top right of the maze.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a diagonal line.

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same size and shape, we need to create a new set of empty spaces that form a diagonal line from the bottom left to the top right of the maze.

## Step 4: Define the new maze
The new maze will have the same size as the original maze, with walls and empty spaces defined as follows:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (6, 4)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal line}$
