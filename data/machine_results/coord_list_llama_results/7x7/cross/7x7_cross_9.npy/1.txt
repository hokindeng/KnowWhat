You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move closer to the goal position (0, 5) from the current player position (3, 4).

First, let's analyze the maze and the possible moves from the current position (3, 4):

- The goal is to reach (0, 5).
- The current position is (3, 4).
- Possible moves are to any adjacent empty space.

Given the maze's layout and the goal, the optimal first move would be to move diagonally towards the goal, as it reduces the distance in both the x and y directions. However, we need to ensure the destination is an empty space.

Looking at the maze, moving diagonally from (3, 4) to (2, 5) is not possible because (2, 5) is a wall. The closest empty space that moves us towards the goal would be to move to (2, 3), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 3), we need to continue moving towards the goal (0, 5). Since we can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll look for the best option.

Given the maze's layout, moving directly to (0, 5) is not possible due to the walls. However, we can move closer to the goal by moving to an empty space that reduces the distance in either the x or y direction.

Looking at the maze, moving to (1, 4) is a good option. It's an empty space that brings us closer to the goal and sets us up for a potential diagonal move in the future.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 4), we need to continue moving towards the goal (0, 5). Since we can move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll look for the best option.

Given the maze's layout, moving directly to (0, 5) is still not possible due to the walls. However, we can move closer to the goal by moving to an empty space that reduces the distance in either the x or y direction.

Looking at the maze, moving to (0, 1) is a good option. It's an empty space that brings us closer to the goal and sets us up for a potential move to the goal in the future.

Therefore, my next move would be to (0, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or "staircase" shape, but more specifically, it resembles a "broken diagonal" or a "stair-step diagonal" shape, as the path moves diagonally from the starting point to the goal, but with interruptions and changes in direction.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "broken diagonal" or "stair-step diagonal" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 4), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Note that this new maze has a similar "broken diagonal" shape, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The path from the player position to the goal is still a diagonal one, but with interruptions and changes in direction.
