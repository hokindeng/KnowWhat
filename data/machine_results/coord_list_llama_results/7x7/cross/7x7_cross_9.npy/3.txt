You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or maze. However, given the constraints of the problem and the need to provide a step-by-step solution, we'll adapt this approach to manually navigate through the maze.

First, let's understand the maze layout and the possible moves from the current player position (3, 4). The goal is to reach (0, 5).

1. **Current Position**: (3, 4)
2. **Goal**: (0, 5)

Given the maze's constraints and the current position, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or diagonals to adjacent empty spaces. However, since we need to move towards the goal (0, 5), we should prioritize moves that bring us closer to the goal.

**Initial Analysis**:
- Moving directly up from (3, 4) is not possible due to walls.
- Moving left or right does not bring us closer to the goal efficiently.
- Moving diagonally up-left or up-right could be beneficial but is blocked by walls in some directions.

**First Move**:
Given the constraints and aiming to move closer to the goal, a reasonable first move would be to try and move up-left or up-right if possible. However, since (3, 4) is surrounded by walls in most directions except for moving down or right (which doesn't directly help in reaching the goal efficiently), we need to think about the next best move that could potentially open up a path towards the goal.

Considering the empty spaces and the goal's position, moving towards the right might not be the most efficient, but moving down could potentially open up a path or create a future opportunity to move left or right towards the goal.

**Decision**:
Given the maze's layout and the goal's position, a strategic move would be to move down to (4, 4), but since (4, 4) is a wall, we look for the next best option. Moving down to (4, 4) is not possible, so we consider moving to an adjacent empty space that could potentially lead us closer to the goal or open up a path.

However, upon reevaluation, considering the direct path and the need to move efficiently towards the goal, and given the constraints of the maze, the best initial move from (3, 4) considering the empty spaces and the goal would actually be to move towards an empty space that directly or indirectly leads towards the goal.

**Corrected Decision**:
Given the layout and the goal to reach (0, 5), and considering the need to provide a step-by-step solution, the initial move should aim to utilize the empty spaces effectively. Since moving directly up is blocked, and moving left or right doesn't immediately help, we should look for a diagonal or a move that sets up a future path.

Upon careful consideration and aiming to move closer to the goal or set up a future move that does, the decision would be to move to an empty space that is closer to the goal or sets up a potential path. However, given the direct approach and the need to simplify the explanation, let's focus on making a move that is feasible and brings us closer to the goal or sets up a future move.

**Final Decision for the First Move**:
Considering the constraints and the goal, and to simplify the navigation process, the first move would ideally be to an empty space that is closer to the goal or sets up a path towards it. Given the direct approach and the need to move efficiently, the decision would be to move to a position that is feasible and brings us closer to the goal.

However, upon careful review, the maze's layout suggests that moving directly towards the goal from the current position involves navigating through the available empty spaces strategically. Given the initial position (3, 4) and the goal (0, 5), and considering the empty spaces provided, a direct path involves moving through specific empty spaces that lead towards the goal.

**Actual First Move**:
Given the constraints and the need to move towards the goal efficiently, and considering the empty spaces and the maze's layout, the first move from (3, 4) would be to move to an empty space that directly or indirectly leads towards the goal. Considering the layout and the goal, the first move would be to (4, 5), as it utilizes the available empty spaces and moves closer to the goal, setting up a potential path for future moves.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (4, 5), the goal is still to reach (0, 5). Since the player is already at the same y-coordinate as the goal, the focus should be on moving left (decreasing the x-coordinate) to reach the goal.

**Analysis**:
- Moving up or down would not bring the player closer to the goal.
- Moving right would move the player away from the goal.
- Moving left is the only direction that brings the player closer to the goal.

**Next Move**:
Considering the empty spaces and the need to move left, the player should aim to move to an empty space that is to the left of the current position. Since (4, 5) is the current position, and there are no walls or obstacles directly to the left that are mentioned, the player should move left.

However, upon reviewing the empty spaces provided, there isn't a direct empty space to the left of (4, 5) that is mentioned. The closest empty space to the left that is mentioned is (3, 4), but moving there would not be a direct move left from (4, 5). Given the constraints and the need to move left, the player should look for the closest empty space that allows for a move towards the goal.

**Decision**:
Given the layout and the goal to reach (0, 5), and considering the need to move left, the player should aim for the closest empty space that is to the left and on the same y-coordinate as the goal or sets up a future move towards the goal. However, since there isn't a direct empty space to the left of (4, 5) that is mentioned, the player should consider moving to an empty space that is closer to the goal and then reassess the next move.

**Actual Next Move**:
Considering the constraints and the need to move towards the goal, and given the empty spaces provided, the next move would ideally be to an empty space that is closer to the goal and sets up a future move towards (0, 5). However, since there isn't a direct move left from (4, 5) to an empty space, the player should look for an alternative move that brings them closer to the goal or sets up a future path.

Given the current position and the goal, and considering the empty spaces, a strategic move would be to move to an empty space that is closer to the goal or sets up a path towards it. Since moving directly left is not possible due to the lack of a mentioned empty space, the player should consider moving to a position that is closer to the goal or sets up a future move.

**Corrected Decision**:
Upon reevaluation, considering the direct path and the need to move efficiently towards the goal, and given the constraints of the maze, the next move should aim to utilize the available empty spaces effectively. Since moving directly left is not possible, the player should look for an alternative move that brings them closer to the goal.

However, given the direct approach and the need to simplify the explanation, let's focus on making a move that is feasible and brings the player closer to the goal or sets up a future path.

**Final Decision for the Next Move**:
Considering the constraints and the goal, and given the empty spaces, the next move would ideally be to an empty space that is closer to the goal or sets up a path towards it. Given the current position (4, 5) and the goal (0, 5), and considering the need to move left, the player should aim for the closest empty space that is to the left and on the same y-coordinate as the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 5)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**General Shape of the Original Maze's Path**:
After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "Zigzag" or more specifically, a "Staircase" shape. This is because the path from the player's position to the goal involves moving in a zigzag pattern, alternating between moving up and then left or right, resembling a staircase.

**New Maze with the Same Shape**:
Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces that form a similar "Staircase" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

This new maze has a similar "Staircase" shape formed by the empty spaces, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The path from the player's position to the goal involves moving in a zigzag pattern, alternating between moving up and then left or right, resembling a staircase.
