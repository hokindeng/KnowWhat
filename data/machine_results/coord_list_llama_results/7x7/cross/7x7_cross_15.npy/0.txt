You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (1, 3), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the adjacent empty spaces
Looking at the maze, the adjacent empty spaces to the current player position (1, 3) are (1, 1) and (2, 2). However, since the goal is to move towards the goal position (3, 1), we should prioritize moving in that direction.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (3, 1) and the available empty spaces, the best next move would be to move diagonally to (2, 2), as it brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (2, 2), and the goal is to reach position (3, 1). We need to analyze the available empty spaces to determine the best next move.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
From position (2, 2), the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, as long as the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the adjacent empty spaces
Looking at the maze, the adjacent empty spaces to the current player position (2, 2) are (1, 1) and (3, 3). However, since the goal is to move towards the goal position (3, 1), we should prioritize moving in that direction.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (3, 1) and the available empty spaces, the best next move would be to move down and right to (3, 3), as it brings us closer to the goal. However, we should note that moving directly to (3, 1) is not possible due to the wall at (3, 2). Therefore, moving to (3, 3) is the best option.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the adjacent empty spaces
Looking at the maze, the adjacent empty spaces to the current player position (3, 3) are none in the direct path to the goal. However, we can move up to (2, 2) and then try to find a path to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (3, 1) and the available empty spaces, the best next move would be to move up to (2, 2), and then try to find a path to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 2)}$

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (3, 1) and the available empty spaces, the best next move would be to move left to (1, 1), and then try to find a path to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (1, 1), and the goal is to reach position (3, 1). We need to analyze the available empty spaces to determine the best next move.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
From position (1, 1), the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, as long as the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the adjacent empty spaces
Looking at the maze, the adjacent empty spaces to the current player position (1, 1) are (1, 3). However, we can also move right to (2, 1) if it were an empty space, but it's a wall. We can move down to (2, 1) is not possible, but we can move to (1, 3) and then try to find a path to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (3, 1) and the available empty spaces, the best next move would be to move down and right is not possible, so we move right is not possible, so we move down is not possible, so we move to (1, 3) and then try to find a path to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 3)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), and (3, 3). The general shape formed by these empty spaces is a diagonal line with a small branch.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The general shape formed by the empty spaces can be described as a "Diagonal Line with a Branch".

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a diagonal line with a small branch. Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (5, 4)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal Line with a Branch}$
