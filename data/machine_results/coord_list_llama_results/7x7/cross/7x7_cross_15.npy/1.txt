You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The current player position is (1, 3). We need to examine the adjacent positions to determine the possible moves. The adjacent positions are (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), and the diagonals.

## Step 3: Eliminate the wall positions from the possible moves
We need to eliminate the positions that are walls. From the given list of walls, we can see that (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4) are walls. The only remaining adjacent empty space is (2, 3).

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since (2, 3) is the only adjacent empty space, we will move to this position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 3)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at coordinates (1, 1), (2, 2), and (3, 3). These coordinates form a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right of the maze.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a diagonal line.

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same size and shape, we will keep the same diagonal line shape for the empty spaces. However, we will shift the line to a different position in the maze.

## Step 4: Determine the coordinates of the empty spaces in the new maze
We will shift the diagonal line one position to the right. The new coordinates of the empty spaces will be (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 4).

## Step 5: Determine the coordinates of the walls in the new maze
The walls will be all the remaining positions in the maze, excluding the empty spaces and the player and goal positions.

## Step 6: Determine the player and goal positions in the new maze
We will keep the same player position (1, 3) and goal position (3, 1) as in the original maze.

## Step 7: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

The final answer is: There is no number to solve this problem, the answer is the description of the shape and the new maze.
