You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the rules for movement.
The maze is a 2D grid with specified walls, empty spaces, a player position (P), and a goal position (G). The player can move to any adjacent empty space, which includes up, down, left, right, and any diagonal direction.

## Step 2: Identify the starting position and the goal position.
The player starts at position (1, 3) and needs to reach the goal at position (3, 1).

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves from the starting position.
Given the starting position (1, 3), we need to look at the adjacent positions to determine the possible next moves. Since the maze's walls and empty spaces are given, we can identify that moving directly to the goal is not possible due to the presence of walls.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move based on the goal position.
Considering the goal is at (3, 1), the best strategy is to move in a direction that brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls. Since we cannot move directly to the goal, we need to find a path around the walls.

## Step 5: Choose the next move.
Looking at the maze, moving from (1, 3) to (1, 1) is not possible due to the wall at (1, 2) and other surrounding walls. However, we can see that (1, 1) is an empty space and is closer to the goal than our current position. But to reach (1, 1), we need to go around the walls. A possible move could be to move diagonally or to an adjacent empty space that is not blocked by walls.

## Step 6: Select the optimal direction.
Given the constraints and the goal position, moving diagonally or to an adjacent empty space that is closer to the goal and not blocked by walls is the optimal strategy. However, since we are at (1, 3) and need to get to (3, 1), and considering the walls, the best immediate move is to head towards the empty space that is closer to the goal and not directly blocked by walls.

## Step 7: Decide on the next move based on the analysis.
Considering the maze layout and the goal, the next move should aim to get closer to the goal while navigating around the walls. Since direct movement to the goal is blocked, we look for an empty space that is a step in the right direction.

## Step 8: Finalize the next move.
Given the analysis, the best next move from (1, 3) considering the goal (3, 1) and the maze layout would be to move to an empty space that is closer to the goal and not blocked by walls. However, due to the complexity of the maze and the need to avoid walls, the direct path to the goal is not immediately clear without further steps.

## Step 9: Re-evaluate the maze for a clearer path.
Upon re-evaluation, considering the empty spaces and the goal, a clearer path involves moving towards the empty spaces that can lead us around the walls and closer to the goal.

## Step 10: Determine the exact next move.
Given the constraints and the need to navigate around walls to reach the goal, the exact next move from (1, 3) needs to be carefully chosen to ensure progress towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 1)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The original maze has empty spaces at (1, 1), (2, 2), and (3, 3), which form a diagonal line. This can be recognized as a diagonal or a straight line shape.

## Step 2: Determine the name of the general shape.
Based on the positions of the empty spaces, the general shape can be described as a "Diagonal Line".

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same size and shape of empty spaces.
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it has the same size (7x7), includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, is not an identical copy of the original maze, and forms a recognizable diagonal line shape with its empty spaces.

## Step 4: Design the new maze.
Given the constraints, we can design a new maze by placing the empty spaces in a diagonal line, ensuring a path from P to G, and adding walls to block other paths.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze.
The new maze will have the following encoding:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (5, 1)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal Line}$
