You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (4, 4) to the goal position (2, 6) while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces. Given the constraints and the layout of the maze, we'll aim to move towards the goal in the most direct way possible, considering the available empty spaces.

First, let's analyze the maze and the positions of the empty spaces and the goal relative to the player's current position:

- The player is at (4, 4).
- The goal is at (2, 6).
- Available empty spaces are (2, 4), (3, 5), and (4, 6).

Given these positions, the most direct path to the goal involves moving diagonally or in a way that gets us closer to the goal while utilizing the available empty spaces. Since we can move diagonally, the first step would be to move towards the empty space that is closest to the goal and also on a path that leads towards the goal.

The closest empty space that is on a path towards the goal from the player's current position (4, 4) is (4, 6), but moving directly there doesn't utilize the diagonal movement efficiently towards the goal. However, moving to (3, 5) first would be a strategic move as it positions us for a potential diagonal move towards the goal in the next step.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 5), as it sets us up for a potential diagonal move towards the goal in the next step and utilizes the available empty spaces efficiently.

Next move: (3, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (3, 5), the next move should aim to get closer to the goal at (2, 6) while utilizing the available empty spaces.

Looking at the available empty spaces, (2, 4) is the closest one to the goal that is also on a path that leads towards the goal. However, moving directly to (2, 4) would not be the most efficient move, as it would require backtracking later to reach the goal.

A more strategic move would be to move diagonally towards the goal, but since there are no empty spaces directly diagonally from the current position, we need to find an alternative.

Considering the available empty spaces and the goal's position, the next best move would be to move to (4, 6). This move gets us closer to the goal and sets us up for a potential move towards the goal in the next step.

Next move: (4, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (4, 6), the next move should aim to get closer to the goal at (2, 6) while utilizing the available empty spaces.

Since we are already at the same y-coordinate as the goal (6), we can focus on moving horizontally towards the goal. The closest empty space to the goal that is also on a path that leads towards the goal is (2, 4), but we cannot move directly there.

However, we can move to (3, 5) and then potentially move to (2, 4) in the next step, which would get us closer to the goal.

Next move: (3, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (3, 5), the next move should aim to get closer to the goal at (2, 6) while utilizing the available empty spaces.

Since we are close to the goal, we can try to move diagonally or horizontally towards the goal. However, there is no direct diagonal or horizontal path to the goal.

The closest empty space to the goal that is also on a path that leads towards the goal is (2, 4). We can move to (2, 4) and then potentially move to the goal in the next step.

Next move: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (2, 4), the next move should aim to get closer to the goal at (2, 6).

Since we are already at the same x-coordinate as the goal (2), we can focus on moving vertically towards the goal. The goal is two spaces above us, and there are no walls or obstacles in the way.

Next move: (2, 6)

This move should put us directly at the goal position, solving the maze.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form an L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (2, 6)

This new maze has an L-shaped path from the player position to the goal, and it meets all the criteria specified.
