You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The current player position is (4, 4). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, but only to empty spaces. We need to examine the empty spaces and walls to determine the possible moves.

## Step 3: Examine the empty spaces and walls to determine the possible moves
The empty spaces are (2, 4), (3, 5), and (4, 6). The walls are listed, but we can see that moving up or left would result in hitting a wall. Moving right or down would also result in hitting a wall. However, moving diagonally up-right to (3, 5) is a possible move.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the possible moves, the next move would be to move diagonally up-right to (3, 5).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The current state of the maze shows the walls, empty spaces, the current player position (3, 5), and the goal position (2, 6).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The current player position is (3, 5). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, but only to empty spaces. We need to examine the empty spaces and walls to determine the possible moves.

## Step 3: Examine the empty spaces and walls to determine the possible moves
The empty spaces are (2, 4), (4, 4), and (4, 6). The walls are listed, but we can see that moving up or left would result in hitting a wall. Moving right would also result in hitting a wall. However, moving diagonally up-left to (2, 6) is not possible because (2, 6) is not an empty space that we can move to directly from (3, 5), but moving diagonally up-left to (2, 4) and then moving up to (2, 6) could be a possible path. Moving down to (4, 5) is not possible because (4, 5) is a wall, but moving down to (4, 4) and then moving up-left to (2, 6) could be a possible path.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the possible moves, the next move would be to move diagonally up-left to (2, 4) because it is a possible move that brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The current state of the maze shows the walls, empty spaces, the current player position (2, 4), and the goal position (2, 6).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The current player position is (2, 4). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, but only to empty spaces. We need to examine the empty spaces and walls to determine the possible moves.

## Step 3: Examine the empty spaces and walls to determine the possible moves
The empty spaces are (3, 5), (4, 4), and (4, 6). The walls are listed, but we can see that moving up is possible because (2, 5) is not a wall and (2, 6) is the goal position. Moving down would result in hitting a wall. Moving left or right would also result in hitting a wall.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the possible moves, the next move would be to move up to (2, 5) and then to (2, 6) because it is a possible move that brings us closer to the goal.

However, since (2, 5) is a wall, we can move up to (2, 6) directly.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 6)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 4), (3, 5), and (4, 6). The general shape formed by these empty spaces is a diagonal line from bottom-left to top-right, but with a limited number of points, it can also be seen as a rough "L" shape or a diagonal line with a small "bend" or "kink" in it. However, given the limited number of points, it's more accurate to describe it as a diagonal line.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same size and shape, we need to create a diagonal line of empty spaces from bottom-left to top-right. We can start by placing the player position (P) at the bottom-left and the goal position (G) at the top-right.

## Step 3: Define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position for the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

The final answer is: 
(1) Diagonal line
(2) Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)
