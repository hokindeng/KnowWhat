You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (3, 1) to the goal position (3, 3) while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

Given the current player position and the goal position, and considering the empty spaces available, the most direct path to the goal would involve moving through the empty spaces in a way that brings us closer to the goal.

Since the goal is at (3, 3) and we are currently at (3, 1), and there are no walls directly between these points but rather a need to navigate around the existing walls and through the available empty spaces, we should aim to move towards the goal in a somewhat diagonal or step-wise manner, depending on the available paths.

However, given the constraints of the maze and the positions of the empty spaces, the direct path to the goal is not immediately clear without visualizing the maze. But we can deduce a logical next step based on the information provided.

Given the empty spaces are at (4, 2), (5, 1), and (5, 3), and our current position is (3, 1), a logical next move would be to move towards one of these empty spaces that brings us closer to the goal or sets us up for a future move towards the goal.

Considering the goal is at (3, 3), moving to (4, 2) seems like a reasonable next step because it moves us closer to the goal's column and also positions us to potentially move up or further right in subsequent moves, depending on the maze's layout and the goal's accessibility.

Therefore, my next move would be to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (5, 1), (5, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and my new position at (4, 2), I need to reassess the path to the goal at (3, 3).

Since I am now at (4, 2) and the goal is at (3, 3), I should aim to move closer to the goal. However, there is a wall at (3, 2) and (3, 4), which means I need to navigate around these obstacles.

Considering the available empty spaces, moving to (5, 1) or (5, 3) does not seem to bring me closer to the goal directly. However, I notice that moving to (3, 1) could be a viable option, as it brings me closer to the goal's column and potentially sets me up for a future move towards the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and my new position at (3, 1), I can see that I am now directly below the goal at (3, 3).

However, there is a wall at (3, 2) that blocks my direct path to the goal. Since I am already at column 3, I need to find a way to move up to the goal.

Considering the available empty spaces, I notice that (5, 1) and (5, 3) are not directly helpful in this situation. But I can try to move up to the goal by navigating around the wall at (3, 2).

Since I am at (3, 1) and the goal is at (3, 3), and there is a wall at (3, 2), I will try to move up to (3, 3) by going around the wall. However, this is not possible with the current empty spaces.

But I can try to move to (4, 2) again, and then reassess the situation. Alternatively, I can try to move to (5, 1) and then see if I can find a path to the goal from there.

However, I notice that I can try to move to (5, 3) and then move left to the goal. This seems like a viable option.

Therefore, my next move would be to (5, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (5, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-shape.
