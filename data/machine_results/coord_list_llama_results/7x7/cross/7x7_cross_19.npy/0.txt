You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (3, 1) to the goal position (3, 3) while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

Given the constraints and the maze layout, the first step would be to move towards the goal position. Since the goal is directly to the right of the player's current position, but there's a wall at (3, 2), we need to find an alternative path.

Looking at the empty spaces provided, (5, 1) and (5, 3) are potential paths, but they are not directly accessible from the current position without going through walls. However, since we can move diagonally, and there's an empty space at (5, 1), we could potentially move diagonally to reach it, but this would not be the most direct path to the goal.

Given the direct goal is blocked by a wall at (3, 2), and considering the movement rules, the best initial move would be to find a path that eventually leads to the goal without immediately trying to reach the goal directly. However, since the maze's layout and the provided empty spaces do not offer a straightforward diagonal or horizontal move to an empty space that directly leads to the goal without going through walls, we must reconsider the approach based on the given information.

Upon reevaluation, considering the constraints and the aim to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and utilizing the given empty spaces effectively, a direct move to the goal is not possible due to the wall at (3, 2). The provided empty spaces do not offer a direct path to the goal without navigating through walls, which is not allowed.

Given the specific constraints and the layout of the maze as described, and adhering strictly to the format requested for the answer, it seems there was an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the direct application of the rules to the specific maze layout provided. The correct approach involves analyzing the maze for a viable path that adheres to the movement rules and avoids walls, which was not accurately captured in the initial response.

However, to correct and provide a response in the requested format based on the initial setup and the misunderstanding in the analysis:

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 1)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Disconnected Islands" or more specifically, a set of isolated points, as the empty spaces are not connected to form a continuous path or a recognizable geometric shape.

(2) Given the original maze's size and the requirement to form a new maze with a similar shape, I will create a new maze with empty spaces that resemble "Disconnected Islands". Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (4, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (5, 3)

This new maze maintains the same size and has a similar "Disconnected Islands" shape formed by the empty spaces. Note that the empty spaces are not connected, and the maze requires careful navigation to reach the goal.
