You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (1, 4), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space, we will examine the neighboring positions.

## Step 3: Examine the neighboring positions
The neighboring positions of (1, 4) are (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), and (2, 5). However, we need to consider only the empty spaces.

## Step 4: Filter out the wall positions and identify the valid moves
From the neighboring positions, we filter out the wall positions. The valid moves are limited to the empty spaces. Since (2, 5) is an empty space and it is diagonally adjacent to the current position, it is a valid move.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (1, 6) and the valid moves, we choose the move that brings us closer to the goal. Moving to (2, 5) is a step towards the goal, but we should also consider moving directly towards the goal if possible. However, since (1, 5) is a wall, we cannot move directly to the right. Therefore, moving to (2, 5) is the best option.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (1, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has been updated to reflect the new player position (2, 5). We need to navigate from this position to the goal position (1, 6) while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (2, 5), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space, we will examine the neighboring positions.

## Step 3: Examine the neighboring positions
The neighboring positions of (2, 5) are (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), and (3, 6). However, we need to consider only the empty spaces and avoid walls.

## Step 4: Filter out the wall positions and identify the valid moves
From the neighboring positions, we filter out the wall positions. The valid moves are limited to the empty spaces. Since (1, 4) and (3, 4) and (3, 6) are empty spaces, they are valid moves. However, we should prioritize moving towards the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (1, 6) and the valid moves, we choose the move that brings us closer to the goal. Moving to (1, 5) is not possible since it is a wall, but moving to (1, 4) and then potentially to (1, 5) if it becomes available or directly to (1, 6) if possible is a step towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 4)}$

Considering the goal position (1, 6) and the valid moves, we choose the move that brings us closer to the goal. Since (1, 5) is a wall, we cannot move directly to the right. However, we can move to (2, 5) and then potentially move to (1, 6) if we find a valid path.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has been updated to reflect the new player position (2, 5). We need to navigate from this position to the goal position (1, 6) while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (2, 5), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space, we will examine the neighboring positions.

## Step 3: Examine the neighboring positions
The neighboring positions of (2, 5) are (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), and (3, 6). However, we need to consider only the empty spaces and avoid walls.

## Step 4: Filter out the wall positions and identify the valid moves
From the neighboring positions, we filter out the wall positions. The valid moves are limited to the empty spaces. Since (1, 4) and (3, 4) and (3, 6) are empty spaces, they are valid moves. However, we should prioritize moving towards the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (1, 6) and the valid moves, we choose the move that brings us closer to the goal. Since (1, 5) is a wall, we cannot move directly to the left. However, we can move to (1, 4) and then potentially move to (1, 6) if we find a valid path.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 6), (1, 4), and (2, 5). These empty spaces form a general shape that can be recognized as an "L-shape" or a "corner" shape.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same size and shape
To generate a new maze with the same size and shape, we will create a new set of empty spaces that form an L-shape or corner shape. We will also ensure that the new maze has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces.

## Step 3: Create the new maze
Here is the new maze:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 4)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$
