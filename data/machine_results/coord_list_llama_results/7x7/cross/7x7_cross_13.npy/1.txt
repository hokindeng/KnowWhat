You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Analyze the given maze data
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 6)

## Step 3: Determine the possible moves from the current player position
From the current player position (1, 4), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 4: Identify the adjacent empty spaces
The adjacent empty spaces to the current player position (1, 4) are (2, 5) and (3, 4).

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Since the goal is to reach the goal position (1, 6), we should move towards the right. However, there is a wall at (1, 5), so we cannot move directly to the right. We can move to (2, 5) and then try to find a path to the goal.

## Step 6: Determine the next move coordinates
The next move coordinates are (2, 5).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (1, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (2, 5), and the goal is to reach position (1, 6).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
From the current player position (2, 5), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Determine the adjacent empty spaces
The adjacent empty spaces to the current player position (2, 5) are (1, 4) and (3, 4), and (3, 6).

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since the goal is to reach the goal position (1, 6), we should move towards the top-left. We can move to (1, 4) and then try to find a path to the goal.

## Step 5: Determine the next move coordinates
However, moving to (1, 4) would be a step back, and we cannot move directly to the goal position (1, 6) because there is a wall at (1, 5). We should move to (3, 4) and then try to find a path to the goal.

## Step 6: Determine the next move coordinates
However, moving to (3, 4) does not seem to lead us closer to the goal. We should move to (3, 6) and then try to find a path to the goal.

## Step 7: Determine the next move coordinates
The next move coordinates are (3, 6).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 6)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Analyze the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 5), (3, 4), and (3, 6), and the player position is (1, 4) with the goal at (1, 6).

## Step 2: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The empty spaces form a diagonal line from the bottom-left to the top-right of the maze.

## Step 3: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "Diagonal Line".

## Step 4: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to create a diagonal line of empty spaces from the bottom-left to the top-right of the maze.

## Step 5: Determine the coordinates of the empty spaces in the new maze
The coordinates of the empty spaces in the new maze are (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 6).

## Step 6: Determine the coordinates of the player position and goal in the new maze
The player position is (0, 0) and the goal is (6, 6).

## Step 7: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original
Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (6, 6)
