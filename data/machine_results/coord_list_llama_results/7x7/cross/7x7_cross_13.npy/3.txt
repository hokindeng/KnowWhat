You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Analyze the given maze data
The given maze data includes the coordinates of the walls, empty spaces, the current player position, and the goal position. We need to use this data to determine the possible moves from the current player position.

## Step 3: Determine the possible moves from the current player position
From the current player position (1, 4), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space. However, we need to avoid walls and ensure that the next move is within the maze boundaries.

## Step 4: Identify the adjacent empty spaces
Based on the given empty spaces, the adjacent empty spaces to the current player position (1, 4) are (2, 5) and (3, 4).

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Since the goal position is (1, 6), which is above the current player position, we should prioritize moving upwards. However, there are no empty spaces directly above the current player position. Therefore, we need to move to an adjacent empty space that brings us closer to the goal position. The best option is to move to (2, 5), which is diagonally up and to the right.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (1, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the current state of the maze
The current state of the maze shows the updated player position at (2, 5) and the remaining empty spaces.

## Step 2: Determine the possible moves from the current player position
From the current player position (2, 5), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space. However, we need to avoid walls and ensure that the next move is within the maze boundaries.

## Step 3: Identify the adjacent empty spaces
Based on the given empty spaces, the adjacent empty spaces to the current player position (2, 5) are (1, 4) and (3, 4), and (3, 6).

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since the goal position is (1, 6), which is above and to the left of the current player position, we should prioritize moving upwards and to the left. However, there are no empty spaces directly above and to the left of the current player position. Therefore, we need to move to an adjacent empty space that brings us closer to the goal position. The best option is to move to (1, 4), which is to the left of the current player position and closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Consider alternative moves
Alternatively, we could move to (3, 4) or (3, 6), but these moves would take us further away from the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since the goal position is (1, 6), which is above the current player position, we should prioritize moving upwards. However, there are no empty spaces directly above the current player position. Therefore, we need to move to an adjacent empty space that brings us closer to the goal position. Unfortunately, there are no adjacent empty spaces that bring us closer to the goal. We need to move to an empty space that will eventually allow us to move upwards. The best option is to move to (2, 5), which is to the right of the current player position.

## Step 5: Consider alternative moves
Alternatively, we could move to (3, 4) or (3, 6), but these moves would take us further away from the goal position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that can be described as a "L-shape" or a "corner" shape, with two corridors that meet at a right angle.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to design a new set of empty spaces that form an L-shape or a corner shape. We will place the new empty spaces in a way that creates a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (5, 4)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$
