You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (1, 4), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space, we will examine the neighboring positions.

## Step 3: Examine the neighboring positions
Looking at the maze, the neighboring positions of (1, 4) are:
- Up: (0, 4) - Wall
- Down: (2, 4) - Wall
- Left: (1, 3) - Wall
- Right: (1, 5) - Wall
- Diagonals: (0, 3), (0, 5), (2, 3), (2, 5) - Among these, (2, 5) is an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since the only available move is to the diagonal position (2, 5), which is an empty space, we will choose this as our next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (1, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has been updated to reflect the new player position at (2, 5). We need to navigate from this position to the goal position at (1, 6).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From the current position (2, 5), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space. We will examine the neighboring positions.

## Step 3: Examine the neighboring positions
Looking at the maze, the neighboring positions of (2, 5) are:
- Up: (1, 5) - Wall
- Down: (3, 5) - Wall
- Left: (2, 4) - Wall
- Right: (2, 6) - Wall
- Diagonals: (1, 4), (1, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6) - Among these, (1, 4) and (3, 4) and (3, 6) are empty spaces, but (1, 6) is the goal position.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since the goal position (1, 6) is directly accessible from the current position, we will choose this as our next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 6)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 5), (3, 4), and (3, 6). These spaces form a diagonal line with a small deviation, but overall, they can be seen as part of a diagonal or a "L-shape" if we consider the movement from the player position to the goal.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will design a maze that has a clear diagonal or "L-shape" path from the player position to the goal position.

## Step 3: Define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position for the new maze
New maze:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (5, 6)

## Step 4: Verify the new maze
The new maze has a clear diagonal path from the player position to the goal position, forming an "L-shape" or diagonal line.

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$
