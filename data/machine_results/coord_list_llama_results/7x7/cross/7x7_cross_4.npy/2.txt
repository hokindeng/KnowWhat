You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the rules for movement.
The maze is a 2D grid with specified walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The player can move to any adjacent empty space, which includes up, down, left, right, or any diagonal move.

## Step 2: Identify the starting position and the goal.
The player starts at position (5, 0) and needs to reach the goal at position (3, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves from the starting position.
Given the starting position (5, 0), we need to look at the adjacent positions to determine where we can move. Since we can move diagonally, we have more options than just the four cardinal directions.

## Step 4: Determine the best initial move based on the goal's position.
Considering the goal is at (3, 2), we want to move in a way that brings us closer to this position. Since we are at (5, 0), moving up or diagonally up-left would be a good initial strategy to get closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Check for obstacles and empty spaces around the starting position.
Looking at the list of walls and empty spaces, we need to ensure our chosen move does not lead us into a wall and instead guides us through an empty space.

## Step 6: Choose the next move.
Given the constraints and the goal, a reasonable next move from (5, 0) would be to move diagonally up-left to get closer to the goal while avoiding walls. However, we must ensure this move lands on an empty space.

## Step 7: Verify the chosen move is valid.
Since (5, 0) is the starting position, moving diagonally up-left would mean moving to (4, -1), which is not within the maze's bounds. Therefore, we need to reconsider our move to ensure it's within the maze and avoids walls.

## Step 8: Reconsider the move based on the maze's layout.
Given the initial mistake, we should look for a move that is within the maze and avoids walls. Moving directly up from (5, 0) to (4, 0) is a valid move as it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 0)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The original maze's empty spaces form a shape that resembles a zigzag or a winding path, but given the constraints and the layout, it's more accurate to describe it as a series of connected, staggered corridors or a "staircase" shape, given the diagonal and orthogonal movements allowed.

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same shape formed by its empty spaces.
To create a new maze with the same general shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a similar pattern of connected, staggered corridors or a "staircase" shape. This involves strategically placing walls and empty spaces to create a path from the player's position to the goal.

## Step 3: Determine the size and layout of the new maze.
The new maze will have the same size as the original, with 7 rows and 7 columns. The player's starting position will be at (5, 0), and the goal will be at a position that allows for a challenging yet solvable path, such as (3, 2), similar to the original maze.

## Step 4: Place the walls and empty spaces to form the desired shape.
To form the "staircase" shape, we will place empty spaces in a staggered pattern, ensuring that there is a valid path from the player's position to the goal. Walls will be placed around the empty spaces to create a challenging maze.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze.
Given the complexity of describing each step in placing walls and empty spaces, we will directly provide the encoded maze, ensuring it meets the criteria of having the same size, a valid path, and the same general shape as the original maze.

The final answer is: 

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (3, 2)
