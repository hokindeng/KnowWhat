You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and movement rules
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The player can move to any adjacent empty space (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) from the current position.

## Step 2: Identify the starting position and goal
The player starts at position (5, 0) and needs to reach the goal at position (3, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find a path to the goal
Looking at the maze, the most direct path from the starting position (5, 0) to the goal (3, 2) would involve moving up and to the left, avoiding walls and trying to stay as close to the goal as possible.

## Step 4: Determine the first move
Given the constraints and the goal, the first move should aim to get closer to the goal while avoiding walls. Since the goal is above and to the left, and considering the walls' positions, the best initial move from (5, 0) would be to move diagonally up and to the left if possible, or to move in a way that sets up for such a move.

## Step 5: Choose the best initial move
Considering the empty spaces and the goal to move diagonally up and to the left, the best initial move from (5, 0) is to move to an empty space that allows for further diagonal or direct movement towards the goal. However, since the maze's layout and the specific rules about diagonal movement are not fully detailed, a safe initial move would be to move up to an empty space that is directly above or as close as possible to the starting position, setting up for a potential diagonal move in the next step.

## Step 6: Select the next position
Given the empty spaces provided, moving directly up from (5, 0) is not possible due to the wall at (6, 0) and other walls blocking direct upward movement. Therefore, the next best move is to find an empty space that is closest to the goal and allows for further movement. Since (5, 4) is an empty space and moving directly to the goal is blocked by walls, moving to (5, 4) or finding a path that utilizes the empty spaces effectively is crucial.

## Step 7: Finalize the next move
Considering the layout and the need to move towards the goal, the most effective move from (5, 0) that utilizes the given empty spaces and avoids walls would be to move to (5, 4), as it is an empty space and allows for potential movement towards the goal in subsequent steps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 4)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze's empty spaces form a shape that resembles a zigzag or a winding path, but given the constraints and the layout, it's more accurate to describe it as a series of connected, staggered, or offset corridors.

## Step 2: Determine the characteristics of the shape
The shape is characterized by its staggered or offset nature, where the path does not proceed directly in any one direction for more than a couple of steps without shifting either horizontally or vertically.

## Step 3: Design a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a similar pattern of staggered or offset corridors. This means creating a path that does not proceed in a straight line for more than a couple of steps without changing direction.

## Step 4: Create the new maze
Given the original maze's size (7x7), we will create a new maze with the same size and shape characteristics.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze
The new maze will have the following characteristics:
- Walls will be placed to create a similar staggered path.
- Empty spaces will form the path, ensuring it is possible to reach the goal from the player's position.
- The player's position and goal will be placed at new locations that are reachable through the path.

New Maze:
Walls: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (0, 4)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Staggered or Offset Corridors}$
