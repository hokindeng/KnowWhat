You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the rules for movement.
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The player can move to any adjacent empty space, which includes up, down, left, right, or any diagonal move.

## Step 2: Identify the starting position and the goal position.
The player starts at position (5, 0) and needs to reach the goal at position (3, 2).

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves from the starting position.
Given the starting position (5, 0), we need to look at the adjacent positions to see which ones are empty and thus valid for the next move.

## Step 4: Determine the valid moves.
From the starting position (5, 0), the only valid move is to move up to position (4, 0) or diagonally to a position that is not blocked by a wall. However, since (4, 0) is not listed as an empty space, we look for diagonal moves. Moving diagonally to (4, 1) is a valid move since (4, 1) is listed as an empty space.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the goal position.
Since the goal is to reach (3, 2), moving to (4, 1) is a step in the right direction as it brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and the goal.
The player is currently at position (4, 1), and the goal is to reach position (3, 2).

## Step 2: Evaluate the possible moves from the current position.
Given the current position (4, 1), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Identify the valid moves.
From (4, 1), moving directly up to (3, 1) is not possible because (3, 1) is a wall. However, moving diagonally up-left to (3, 0) is also not possible because (3, 0) is a wall. Moving right to (4, 2) is not possible because (4, 2) is a wall. Moving down to (5, 1) is not possible because (5, 1) is a wall. Moving left to (3, 1) is not possible because (3, 1) is a wall. However, moving diagonally up-right to (3, 2) is not directly possible because we need to navigate around the walls.

## Step 4: Choose a move that navigates around the walls towards the goal.
Since moving directly to the goal is not possible due to the wall at (3, 1), we need to find an alternative route. Moving to (4, 3) is a valid move as it is an empty space, and it brings us closer to finding a path around the walls to the goal.

## Step 5: Select the next move.
Given the constraints and the goal, moving to (4, 3) is the best next step as it keeps us moving towards the goal while navigating around the walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The original maze's empty spaces form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or a "staircase" pattern, but more accurately, it can be described as a series of connected "L-shapes" or a "stepped" path.

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same shape formed by its empty spaces.
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will aim to replicate the "stepped" or "L-shaped" pattern of empty spaces while ensuring the maze is not an identical copy of the original and includes a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Determine the size and layout of the new maze.
The new maze will be the same size as the original, with the same number of rows and columns.

## Step 4: Create the new maze.
Given the complexity of manually describing each step in creating a new maze that meets all the criteria, the focus will be on providing the final encoded maze that represents the new layout.

The final answer is: 

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (3, 3)
