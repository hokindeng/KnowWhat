You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (5, 0) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the shortest path to the goal
Looking at the maze, the goal position is (3, 2). Since we can move diagonally, we should try to move in a way that gets us closer to the goal in the fewest number of moves.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
From the current position (5, 0), moving diagonally up-left would be the most efficient way to get closer to the goal. However, we need to check if the space is empty. The space (4, -1) is not valid since it's outside the maze, and (4, 0) is a wall. The closest valid move would be to move up to (4, 0) is not possible, so we look for the next best option.

## Step 5: Choose the next best move
Since moving directly up-left is not possible due to the wall at (4, 0), we look for the next best option. Moving left is not possible because the space (5, -1) is outside the maze. Moving up to a valid empty space is not possible due to the walls. Moving right is the only viable option to get closer to the goal indirectly by utilizing the empty spaces efficiently.

## Step 6: Select the optimal move
Given the constraints and the goal to move closer to (3, 2), moving right to (5, 1) is not possible due to the wall, but moving to (5, 4) is possible as it is an empty space. However, considering the goal's position and the maze's layout, moving to (5, 4) does not directly contribute to reaching the goal efficiently. We need to reconsider our approach based on the available empty spaces and the goal's position.

## Step 7: Reconsider the approach
Given the maze's layout and the goal's position, a more efficient approach would be to move towards the goal by utilizing the empty spaces that lead closer to it. Since direct diagonal moves towards the goal are blocked by walls, we need to find an alternative route.

## Step 8: Identify an alternative route
Considering the empty spaces and the goal's position, moving to (4, 1) or (4, 3) could be a viable option as these spaces are empty and could potentially lead to a path towards the goal.

## Step 9: Choose the best alternative move
Between (4, 1) and (4, 3), moving to (4, 1) seems more promising as it is closer to the goal's x-coordinate and could potentially offer a clearer path towards the goal.

## Step 10: Finalize the next move
Given the analysis, the best next move from the current player position (5, 0) would be to move to (4, 1) as it is an empty space that could lead towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (4, 1), and the goal is at position (3, 2). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
From the current position (4, 1), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the shortest path to the goal
Looking at the maze, the goal position is (3, 2). Since we can move diagonally, we should try to move in a way that gets us closer to the goal in the fewest number of moves.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
From the current position (4, 1), moving diagonally up-left would be the most efficient way to get closer to the goal. However, we need to check if the space is empty.

## Step 5: Choose the next best move
Since moving directly up-left is not possible due to the wall at (3, 1), we look for the next best option. Moving up to (3, 2) is not possible due to the wall at (3, 1), but moving to (4, 2) is not possible due to the wall. However, moving to (4, 3) is possible as it is an empty space.

## Step 6: Select the optimal move
Given the constraints and the goal to move closer to (3, 2), moving to (4, 3) does not directly contribute to reaching the goal efficiently. However, considering the maze's layout, moving to (4, 3) could potentially offer a clearer path towards the goal.

## Step 7: Reconsider the approach
Given the maze's layout and the goal's position, a more efficient approach would be to move towards the goal by utilizing the empty spaces that lead closer to it. Since direct diagonal moves towards the goal are blocked by walls, we need to find an alternative route.

## Step 8: Identify an alternative route
Considering the empty spaces and the goal's position, moving to (3, 2) is not possible due to the wall at (3, 1). However, moving to (2, 1) and then to (2, 2) and then to (3, 2) could be a viable option.

## Step 9: Choose the best alternative move
However, moving to (2, 1) is not possible from the current position. We need to find another alternative route.

## Step 10: Finalize the next move
Given the analysis, the best next move from the current player position (4, 1) would be to move to (4, 3) as it is an empty space that could potentially lead towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces that form a zigzag or winding path. However, upon closer inspection, it can be observed that the empty spaces are more akin to a series of connected "L" shapes or a zigzag pattern with a mix of horizontal and vertical segments.

## Step 2: Determine the name of the general shape
Given the observation in Step 1, the general shape formed by the empty spaces can be described as a zigzag or a winding path with a mix of horizontal and vertical segments. However, for the sake of simplicity and clarity, let's refer to this shape as a "zigzag" pattern.

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a zigzag pattern. We will place the empty spaces in a way that creates a winding path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Here is the new maze with the same shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (3, 3)

The final answer is: $\boxed{zigzag}$
