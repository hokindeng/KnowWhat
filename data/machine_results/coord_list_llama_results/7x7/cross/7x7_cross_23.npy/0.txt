You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (5, 2), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we will examine the neighboring positions.

## Step 3: Examine the neighboring positions
The neighboring positions of (5, 2) are (4, 2), (6, 2), (5, 1), (5, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (6, 1), and (6, 3). We need to check which of these positions are empty spaces.

## Step 4: Check the neighboring positions for empty spaces
From the given empty spaces, (3, 2), (4, 3), and (5, 4), we can see that (4, 3) is a possible move.

## Step 5: Determine the best move
Since our goal is to reach (3, 4), moving to (4, 3) brings us closer to the goal and is a valid move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (5, 2), (5, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has been updated to reflect the new player position (4, 3). We need to navigate from this position to the goal position (3, 4).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (4, 3), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we will examine the neighboring positions.

## Step 3: Examine the neighboring positions
The neighboring positions of (4, 3) are (3, 3), (5, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (3, 2), (5, 2), (3, 4), and (5, 4). We need to check which of these positions are empty spaces.

## Step 4: Check the neighboring positions for empty spaces
From the given empty spaces, (3, 2), (5, 2), and (5, 4), we can see that (3, 2) is a possible move, but it would be moving away from the goal. However, (3, 4) is also a possible move and it is the goal position.

## Step 5: Determine the best move
Since our goal is to reach (3, 4), moving to (3, 4) directly achieves the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 4)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (3, 2), (4, 3), and (5, 4), and the goal is at (3, 4). By examining the positions of these empty spaces, we can see that they form a rough diagonal line from the bottom right to the top left, but with a limited number of steps, it's more accurate to describe the shape as a small, irregular, or fragmented diagonal or a short diagonal segment.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will place the empty spaces in a similar diagonal or fragmented diagonal pattern. However, to ensure the new maze is not an identical copy of the original, we will adjust the positions of the empty spaces and the goal.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
The new maze will have the same size as the original maze. We will place the empty spaces at (2, 5), (3, 4), and (4, 3), and the goal will be at (2, 4). The player position will be at (4, 5).

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (2, 4)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Fragmented diagonal}$
