You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (5, 2), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space, we will examine the neighboring positions.

## Step 3: Examine the neighboring positions
The neighboring positions of (5, 2) are: (4, 2), (6, 2), (5, 1), (5, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (6, 1), (6, 3). We need to check which of these positions are empty spaces.

## Step 4: Check for empty spaces among the neighboring positions
From the given list of empty spaces, (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4), we can see that (4, 3) is one of the neighboring positions of (5, 2) and it is an empty space.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Since (4, 3) is an empty space and it is closer to the goal position (3, 4) than the current position (5, 2), we will choose (4, 3) as the next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (5, 2), (5, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (4, 3), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space, we will examine the neighboring positions.

## Step 3: Examine the neighboring positions
The neighboring positions of (4, 3) are: (3, 3), (5, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 4). We need to check which of these positions are empty spaces.

## Step 4: Check for empty spaces among the neighboring positions
From the given list of empty spaces, (3, 2), (5, 2), (5, 4), we can see that (3, 2) and (5, 4) are not directly adjacent to (4, 3), but (5, 4) is not a viable option since it would be moving away from the goal. However, (3, 4) is adjacent to (4, 3) and is the goal position.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Since (3, 4) is the goal position and it is adjacent to the current position (4, 3), we will choose (3, 4) as the next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 4)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (3, 2), (4, 3), and (5, 4). These points form a diagonal line from the bottom left to the top right of the maze.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a diagonal line.

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze, we will keep the same size (7x7) and create a new set of empty spaces that form a diagonal line.

## Step 4: Define the new set of empty spaces
The new set of empty spaces will be: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 6).

## Step 5: Define the new set of walls
The new set of walls will be all the remaining positions in the maze, excluding the empty spaces and the player and goal positions.

## Step 6: Define the new player and goal positions
The new player position will be (1, 1) and the new goal position will be (6, 6).

## Step 7: Encode the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 6)

The final answer is: Diagonal line
