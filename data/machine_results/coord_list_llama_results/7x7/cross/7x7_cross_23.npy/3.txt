You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we need to navigate from the player position (5, 2) to the goal position (3, 4) while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces. Given the constraints and the maze layout, we'll plan a step-by-step path.

First, let's analyze the maze and the positions:

- Walls block the top, left, and bottom edges of the maze, with some internal walls.
- The player starts at (5, 2).
- The goal is at (3, 4).
- Empty spaces (path) are at (3, 2), (4, 3), and (5, 4).

Given the layout, a possible path to the goal involves moving upwards and to the left from the starting position. However, since we can move diagonally, we can try to move directly towards the goal while avoiding walls.

A potential first move could be to move diagonally up and to the left, aiming to get closer to the goal position. However, we need to ensure that our move lands on an empty space or a space that is not a wall.

Given the constraints and the goal to move efficiently towards the goal, a reasonable first move would be to aim for the empty space at (4, 3), as it's a step closer to the goal and avoids walls.

Therefore, my next move would be to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (5, 2), (5, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we're now at position (4, 3) and need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 4).

Looking at the available empty spaces and the goal position, a logical next move would be to move diagonally up and to the left again, aiming to get closer to the goal.

However, since we can't move directly to the goal due to the wall at (3, 3), we need to find an alternative path. Given the empty spaces available, moving to (3, 2) seems like a viable option, as it's a step closer to the goal and doesn't hit a wall.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we're now at position (3, 2) and need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 4).

Since we're already on the same column as the goal, we can try to move directly up. However, there's a wall at (3, 3) blocking our path.

In this case, we need to find an alternative route. Since we can't move up, we can try to move to the right and then up, or move to the left and then up. However, moving to the left would put us outside the maze, so that's not an option.

Moving to the right is also not an option since there's no empty space to the right of our current position.

However, we can see that there's an empty space at (4, 3) which is one step to the right and one step down from our current position. From there, we might be able to find a way to move up and reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (5, 2), (5, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we're now at position (4, 3) and need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 4).

Since we're one step to the right of the goal, we can try to move left. However, there's a wall at (3, 3) blocking our direct path to the goal.

But we can see that there's an empty space at (3, 2) which is one step to the left and one step down from our current position. From there, we might be able to find a way to move up and reach the goal.

However, since we can move diagonally, we can try to move diagonally up and to the left, aiming to get closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 4), trying to move diagonally up and to the left to reach the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (3, 4)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and forms an L-shape with its empty spaces. However, it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
