You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the rules for movement.
The maze is a 2D grid with specified walls, empty spaces, a player position (P), and a goal position (G). The player can move to any adjacent empty space, which includes up, down, left, right, and any diagonal direction.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and the goal position.
The current player position is (2, 1), and the goal position is (0, 1).

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves from the current player position.
Given the current player position (2, 1) and the layout of the maze, we need to find an empty space that is adjacent to the current position. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, and diagonals, but we must avoid walls.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move towards the goal position.
Since the goal is to reach (0, 1) from (2, 1), the most direct path would involve moving upwards. However, we must consider the layout of the maze and the positions of the walls and empty spaces.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the analysis.
Considering the maze layout and the goal to move upwards towards (0, 1), the next best move from (2, 1) would be to move to an empty space that brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

## Step 6: Select the specific coordinates for the next move.
Given the constraints and the goal, the next move should aim to move upwards. However, since (2, 1) is surrounded by walls in most directions except for the empty space at (1, 2) and considering diagonal moves are allowed, the best move would be to move diagonally to an empty space that is closer to the goal.

## Step 7: Finalize the next move coordinates.
Considering the available empty spaces and the need to move closer to the goal at (0, 1), and given the diagonal move option, the best next move from (2, 1) would be to move to (1, 2), as it is an empty space and moving diagonally is allowed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and the goal position.
The current player position is (1, 2), and the goal position is (0, 1).

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves from the current player position.
Given the current player position (1, 2) and the layout of the maze, we need to find an empty space that is adjacent to the current position. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, and diagonals, but we must avoid walls.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move towards the goal position.
Since the goal is to reach (0, 1) from (1, 2), the most direct path would involve moving upwards and to the left. However, we must consider the layout of the maze and the positions of the walls and empty spaces.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the analysis.
Considering the maze layout and the goal to move upwards and to the left towards (0, 1), the next best move from (1, 2) would be to move to an empty space that brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

## Step 6: Select the specific coordinates for the next move.
Given the constraints and the goal, the next move should aim to move upwards and to the left. However, since (1, 2) is surrounded by walls in most directions except for the empty space at (0, 3) and considering diagonal moves are allowed, the best move would be to move diagonally to an empty space that is closer to the goal.

## Step 7: Finalize the next move coordinates.
Considering the available empty spaces and the need to move closer to the goal at (0, 1), and given the diagonal move option, the best next move from (1, 2) would be to move to (0, 3), as it is an empty space and moving diagonally is allowed, but since we cannot move to (0, 1) directly due to the wall at (0, 2), moving to (0, 3) brings us closer to the goal and allows for further movement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(0, 3)}$

The maze is a 2D grid with specified walls, empty spaces, a player position (P), and a goal position (G). The player can move to any adjacent empty space, which includes up, down, left, right, and any diagonal direction.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and the goal position.
The current player position is (1, 2), and the goal position is (0, 1).

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves from the current player position.
Given the current player position (1, 2) and the layout of the maze, we need to find an empty space that is adjacent to the current position. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, and diagonals, but we must avoid walls.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move towards the goal position.
Since the goal is to reach (0, 1) from (1, 2), the most direct path would involve moving upwards and to the left. However, we must consider the layout of the maze and the positions of the walls and empty spaces.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the analysis.
Considering the maze layout and the goal to move upwards and to the left towards (0, 1), the next best move from (1, 2) would be to move to an empty space that brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

## Step 6: Select the specific coordinates for the next move.
Given the constraints and the goal, the next move should aim to move upwards and to the left. However, since (1, 2) is surrounded by walls in most directions except for the empty space at (2, 1) and considering diagonal moves are allowed, the best move would be to move diagonally to an empty space that is closer to the goal.

## Step 7: Finalize the next move coordinates.
Considering the available empty spaces and the need to move closer to the goal at (0, 1), and given the diagonal move option, the best next move from (1, 2) would be to move to (2, 1), as it is an empty space and moving diagonally is allowed.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 1)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.
The original maze has empty spaces that form a zigzag or winding path.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape.
To create a new maze with the same size and shape, we need to generate a new set of empty spaces that form a zigzag or winding path.

## Step 3: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original.
