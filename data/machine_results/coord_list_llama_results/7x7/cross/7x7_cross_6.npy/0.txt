You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (2, 1), we need to identify the possible moves. We can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, we can see that the current player position (2, 1) is surrounded by walls on the left, right, and bottom. The only possible move is up to the empty space (1, 1) or diagonally up-left to the empty space (1, 2).

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since the goal position is (0, 1), we should move up to the empty space (1, 1) to get closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 1)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at coordinates (0, 3), (1, 2), and (2, 3). These empty spaces form a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right, but with a gap in the middle. However, considering the overall structure and the movement restrictions, it can be inferred that the intended shape is a diagonal line or a "Diagonal Path".

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape, but with a valid path from P to G
To create a new maze, we will maintain the same size (7x7) and ensure that the empty spaces form a recognizable diagonal path. We will also include a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

## Step 3: Define the new maze
The new maze will have the following characteristics:
- Walls: Most of the grid will be walls, except for the diagonal path and the player and goal positions.
- Empty spaces: The diagonal path will be formed by empty spaces from (0, 0) to (6, 6), with some adjustments to ensure a valid path from P to G.
- Player position (P): (2, 1)
- Goal position (G): (5, 4)

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (2, 1), (5, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (5, 4)

The final answer is: There is no numerical answer for this problem, as it requires a descriptive and encoded response.
