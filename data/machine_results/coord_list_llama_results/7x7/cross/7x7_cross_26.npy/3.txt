You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (0, 4) and the goal is (2, 4), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space, we examine the surroundings of the current position.

## Step 3: Analyze the surroundings of the current position
Looking at the maze, the current position (0, 4) is surrounded by walls on the left, top, and bottom. The only possible move from this position is to the right, but since (1, 4) is a wall, we need to find an alternative route.

## Step 4: Find an alternative route
Since moving directly to the right is blocked by a wall, we look for the nearest empty space that is accessible. The nearest empty space to the right of the current position is (1, 5), which is accessible by moving diagonally down and to the right.

## Step 5: Determine the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to the empty space (1, 5), which is diagonally down and to the right of the current position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (0, 6), (2, 6)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has been updated to reflect the new player position at (1, 5). The goal remains at (2, 4).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From the current position (1, 5), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space. However, since the maze is mostly surrounded by walls, we need to find a path that leads us closer to the goal.

## Step 3: Analyze the surroundings of the current position
Looking at the maze, the current position (1, 5) is surrounded by walls on the left, top, and bottom. The only possible move from this position is to the right or down.

## Step 4: Find a path to the goal
Since the goal is at (2, 4), we need to find a path that leads us down and to the right. However, moving directly down is blocked by a wall at (1, 4). We need to find an alternative route.

## Step 5: Determine the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to move down and to the right, but since that is blocked, we will move down to the empty space (2, 6) is not accessible from this position, so we will move down to the wall and then try to find another path.

## Step 6: Re-evaluate the path
Since moving down to the wall does not lead us to the goal, we need to re-evaluate the path. We can move right to the wall and then try to find another path.

## Step 7: Determine the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to move right to the wall and then try to find another path, but since moving right is not possible, we will move down to (2, 5) is not possible, so we will move down to (2, 6) is not possible from this position, so we will move right to the wall and then try to find another path, but since moving right is not possible, we will move down.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 5)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The original maze has empty spaces at (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), and (2, 6). The general shape formed by these empty spaces is a diagonal line with a small branch.

## Step 2: Name the general shape
The general shape formed by the empty spaces can be described as a "Diagonal Line with a Branch".

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to generate a new set of empty spaces that form a diagonal line with a branch. We will keep the same size as the original maze.

## Step 4: Define the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 6)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal Line with a Branch}$
