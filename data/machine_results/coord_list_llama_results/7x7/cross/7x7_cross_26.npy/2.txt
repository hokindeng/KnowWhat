You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (0, 4), we need to identify the possible adjacent empty spaces. Since we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally, we will check all these directions for empty spaces.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the closest empty space to the current player position
From the given empty spaces, (0, 6), (1, 5), and (2, 6), we need to find the closest one to the current player position (0, 4). The closest empty space is (1, 5), but since we cannot move diagonally to a wall, we need to find an alternative route.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Since the goal is to reach (2, 4) and the closest empty space to the current player position is (1, 5), we should move towards (1, 5) first. However, we cannot move directly to (1, 5) because it would require moving through a wall. We need to find an alternative route.

## Step 5: Find an alternative route to the goal
Upon re-examining the maze, we notice that we can move to (0, 6) and then try to find a path to (2, 4). However, this would require backtracking. A better approach is to move to (1, 5) and then try to find a path to (2, 4).

## Step 6: Move to the closest empty space
Since we cannot move directly to (1, 5), we will move to the closest empty space, which is (0, 6).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(0, 6)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (0, 6), (1, 5), and (2, 6). These spaces form a diagonal line or a "slash" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will place the empty spaces in a diagonal line. We will also ensure that the new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze and that there is a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Determine the size of the new maze
The original maze has a size of 7x7. We will keep the same size for the new maze.

## Step 4: Place the empty spaces in the new maze
We will place the empty spaces in a diagonal line, similar to the original maze. Let's place them at (0, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 2).

## Step 5: Add walls to the new maze
We will add walls to the new maze to ensure that there is only one valid path from P to G. We will place walls at all other positions, except for the empty spaces and the path from P to G.

## Step 6: Define the player position and goal in the new maze
Let's place the player position at (0, 0) and the goal at (2, 2).

## Step 7: Encode the new maze
Here is the new maze encoded in the same format as the original:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 2)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal}$
