You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (0, 4) and the goal is (2, 4), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space, we will examine the neighboring positions.

## Step 3: Examine the neighboring positions of the current player position
The neighboring positions of (0, 4) are (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (-1, 4), (-1, 3), (-1, 5), (0, 3) is a wall, (0, 5) is a wall, (1, 3) is a wall, (1, 4) is a wall, (1, 5) is an empty space, (-1, 4) is out of bounds, (-1, 3) is out of bounds, and (-1, 5) is out of bounds.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the examination of the neighboring positions, the only valid move is to the position (1, 5), which is an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (0, 6), (2, 6)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (1, 5) and the goal is (2, 4), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space, we will examine the neighboring positions.

## Step 3: Examine the neighboring positions of the current player position
The neighboring positions of (1, 5) are (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (-1, 5), (-1, 4), (-1, 6), (0, 4) is an empty space, (0, 6) is an empty space, (1, 4) is a wall, (1, 6) is a wall, (2, 4) is the goal, (2, 6) is an empty space, (-1, 5) is out of bounds, (-1, 4) is out of bounds, and (-1, 6) is out of bounds.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the examination of the neighboring positions, the best move is to the position (2, 4), which is the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 4)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), and (2, 6), and the goal is at (2, 4). The shape formed by these empty spaces is a diagonal line with a small branch.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The general shape formed by the empty spaces can be described as a "Diagonal Line with a Branch".

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a diagonal line with a small branch. We will place the empty spaces at (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), and (1, 6), and the goal at (3, 4).

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
The new maze will have the following walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

The final answer is: 
(1) Diagonal Line with a Branch
(2) Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)
