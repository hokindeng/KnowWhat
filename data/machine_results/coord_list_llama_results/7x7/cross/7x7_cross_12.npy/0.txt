You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The current player position is (5, 6). We need to examine the adjacent positions to determine which ones are empty spaces and thus valid moves. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Examine the adjacent positions
Looking at the maze, the adjacent positions to (5, 6) are (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 7) - which is out of bounds, (5, 5), (5, 7) - which is out of bounds, (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 7) - which is out of bounds, (5, 4) is a wall, (4, 4) is a wall, and (3, 5) is not directly adjacent but (4, 5) is a valid move.

## Step 4: Determine the valid moves
From the examination, the valid moves are (4, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), and (6, 5), (6, 6). However, since the goal is to move towards the goal position (4, 3), we should prioritize moves that bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (4, 3), the best next move from (5, 6) would be to move to (4, 5) as it brings us closer to the goal and is a valid move through an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The current player position is (4, 5). We need to examine the adjacent positions to determine which ones are empty spaces and thus valid moves. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Examine the adjacent positions
Looking at the maze, the adjacent positions to (4, 5) are (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 6) - which is a wall, (4, 4) - which is a wall, (4, 6) - which is a wall, (5, 5) - which is a wall, (5, 4), (5, 6), (4, 3) is not directly blocked by a wall but is a valid move towards the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the valid moves
From the examination, the valid moves are (3, 5), (3, 4), (5, 4), (5, 6), and (4, 3) is not blocked by a wall but is a valid move towards the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (4, 3), the best next move from (4, 5) would be to move to (4, 4) but it is a wall, so the next best move would be to move to (4, 3) is not blocked by a wall but is a valid move towards the goal, however, we should also consider moving to (3, 4) as it also brings us closer to the goal.

## Step 6: Choose between (4, 3) and (3, 4)
Since (4, 3) is the goal position, moving to (4, 3) would be the best next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2), and (5, 6). By examining these coordinates, we can see that the empty spaces form a zigzag or a winding path.

## Step 2: Determine the name of the general shape
Based on the examination, the general shape formed by the empty spaces can be described as a "zigzag" or "winding path". However, for the purpose of this task, let's call it a "zigzag".

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a zigzag pattern. We will place the empty spaces in a way that creates a winding path from the player position to the goal position.

## Step 4: Define the new maze
Here is the new maze with the same shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (2, 5), (1, 6), (3, 2)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (1, 2)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a "zigzag".

The final answer is: $\boxed{zigzag}$
