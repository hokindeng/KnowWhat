You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (5, 6), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where we can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the shortest path to the goal
Since the goal is to reach (4, 3) from (5, 6), we should prioritize moving towards the goal while avoiding walls. We can move diagonally to (4, 5) as it is an empty space and closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to (4, 5) as it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (4, 5), and the goal is to reach (4, 3). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From (4, 5), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the shortest path to the goal
Since the goal is to reach (4, 3), we should prioritize moving down towards the goal. However, we need to avoid walls and navigate through empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to (4, 4) as it is an empty space (although not explicitly listed, it is implied by the absence of a wall at that coordinate) and brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 4)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2), and (5, 6). By examining these coordinates, we can see that the empty spaces form a zigzag or a winding path.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape and size as the original
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a similar winding path. We will place the empty spaces in a way that creates a recognizable zigzag shape.

## Step 3: Define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal for the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (4, 1)

The final answer is: $\boxed{zigzag}$
