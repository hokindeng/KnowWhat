You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (6, 1) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and their proximity to the goal
The empty spaces are (4, 1), (4, 3), and (5, 2). The goal position is (6, 3). To move closer to the goal, we should prioritize moving towards the empty space that is closest to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Since the goal is to the right of the current player position, and there is an empty space at (5, 2) which is closer to the goal than moving left or up, the best next move would be to move diagonally up and to the right towards (5, 2).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (6, 1)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is now at position (5, 2), and the goal is at position (6, 3). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (5, 2) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and their proximity to the goal
The empty spaces are (4, 1), (4, 3), and (6, 1). The goal position is (6, 3). To move closer to the goal, we should prioritize moving towards the empty space that is closest to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Since the goal is to the right of the current player position, and there is no direct empty space to the right, the best next move would be to move down to the empty space at (6, 1), and then try to move right from there.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(6, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is now at position (6, 1), and the goal is at position (6, 3). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Since the goal is to the right of the current player position, and there is no wall at (6, 2), the best next move would be to move right to (6, 2) and then try to move right again to reach the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(6, 2)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2), and (6, 1), with the goal at (6, 3). The shape formed by these empty spaces can be described as a diagonal or slanted path.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will place the empty spaces in a similar diagonal pattern. We will also ensure that the new maze is not an identical copy of the original and includes a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
The new maze will have the same size as the original, with 7 rows and 7 columns. We will place the empty spaces at (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4), and (6, 5), with the goal at (6, 6). The player position will be at (3, 1).

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Empty: (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (6, 6)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal}$
