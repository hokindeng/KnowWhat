You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (6, 1) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and their proximity to the goal
The empty spaces are (4, 1), (4, 3), and (5, 2). The goal is at (6, 3). To move closer to the goal, we should prioritize moving towards the empty space that is closest to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Since the goal is at (6, 3) and the current player position is at (6, 1), the best next move would be to move diagonally or directly to the right to get closer to the goal. However, there are no empty spaces directly adjacent to the current position that would allow a direct move to the right. Therefore, we need to find an alternative route.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Considering the empty spaces available, moving to (5, 2) is not a direct path to the goal, but it is a necessary step to eventually reach the goal. However, since we cannot move directly to (5, 2) from (6, 1) due to the wall at (6, 2), we should look for an alternative. The closest empty space that allows a move towards the goal is actually (4, 1), but moving there would not bring us closer to the goal. The best option is to move to a position that sets us up for a future move towards the goal. Given the constraints, the best immediate move is actually to move up to (5, 1), but since (5, 1) is a wall, we cannot move there. We must reconsider our approach based on the available empty spaces and the goal's position.

## Step 6: Reconsider the approach based on the available information
Given the constraints and the layout of the maze, the best approach is to move towards the goal by utilizing the available empty spaces efficiently. Since we cannot move directly to the goal, we should aim to move to a position that sets us up for a future move towards the goal. The empty space at (4, 3) is closer to the goal than (4, 1) and (5, 2), but we cannot move there directly from (6, 1). We need to find a path that allows us to move closer to the goal.

## Step 7: Finalize the next move
Considering the maze's layout and the available empty spaces, the best next move is to move to a position that sets us up for a future move towards the goal. However, given the constraints of the maze and the available empty spaces, the most direct path to the goal involves moving to a position that is not directly adjacent to the current position. We should aim to move to (5, 2) eventually, but since we cannot move there directly, we need to find an alternative route.

## Step 8: Determine the alternative route
Since we cannot move directly to (5, 2) or (4, 3) from (6, 1), we should look for an alternative route. However, given the constraints of the maze, the best approach is to move towards the goal by utilizing the available empty spaces efficiently.

## Step 9: Re-evaluate the maze and the goal
Given the maze's layout and the goal's position, the best approach is to move towards the goal by utilizing the available empty spaces efficiently. Since we cannot move directly to the goal, we should aim to move to a position that sets us up for a future move towards the goal.

## Step 10: Finalize the alternative route
Considering the maze's layout and the available empty spaces, the best next move is to move to a position that sets us up for a future move towards the goal. However, given the constraints of the maze and the available empty spaces, the most direct path to the goal involves moving to a position that is not directly adjacent to the current position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (4, 1), (4, 3), and (5, 2), and the goal is at (6, 3). The shape formed by these empty spaces is a diagonal line with a small deviation.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The general shape formed by the empty spaces can be described as a "Diagonal Line with a Deviation" or more simply as a "Diagonal Path".

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a diagonal line with a deviation. We can achieve this by placing the empty spaces in a diagonal pattern with a small deviation.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Here is the new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (6, 4)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal Path}$
