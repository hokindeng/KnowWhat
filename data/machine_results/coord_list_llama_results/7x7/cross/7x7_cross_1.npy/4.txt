You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (6, 1), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the shortest path to the goal
Looking at the maze, we can see that the goal position is (6, 3). Since the player is currently at (6, 1), the shortest path would be to move right, but we need to avoid walls and move through empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
From the current position (6, 1), we can move right to (6, 2) or down to (6, 2) is not possible because (6, 2) is a wall, but we can move up to (5, 1) is not possible because (5, 1) is not an empty space, but we can move up to (5, 2) is possible because (5, 2) is an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (6, 1)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the shortest path to the goal
Looking at the maze, we can see that the goal position is (6, 3). Since the player is currently at (5, 2), the shortest path would be to move down and right, but we need to avoid walls and move through empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
From the current position (5, 2), we can move down to (6, 2) is not possible because (6, 2) is a wall, but we can move right to (5, 3) is not possible because (5, 3) is a wall, but we can move down to (6, 1) is possible because (6, 1) is an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(6, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

## Step 4: Determine the next move
From the current position (6, 1), we can move right to (6, 2) is not possible because (6, 2) is a wall, but we can move right to (6, 3) is not possible because there is no empty space to the right of (6, 1) that is not a wall, but we can move up to (5, 1) is not possible because (5, 1) is a wall, but we can move up to (5, 2) is possible because (5, 2) is an empty space, then we can move right to (5, 3) is not possible because (5, 3) is a wall, but we can move down to (6, 2) is not possible because (6, 2) is a wall, but we can move down to (6, 3) is not possible because there is a wall at (6, 2), but we can move up to (5, 2) then down to (4, 2) is not possible because (4, 2) is a wall, but we can move up to (5, 2) then down to (4, 3) is possible because (4, 3) is an empty space, then we can move right to (5, 3) is not possible because (5, 3) is a wall, but we can move right to (6, 3) is possible because there is no wall at (6, 3) and (6, 3) is the goal.

However, a shorter path exists: we can move up to (5, 2) then down to (4, 2) is not possible because (4, 2) is a wall, but we can move up to (5, 2) then down to (4, 3) is possible because (4, 3) is an empty space, then we can move right to (5, 3) is not possible because (5, 3) is a wall, but we can move right to (6, 3) is possible because there is no wall at (6, 3) and (6, 3) is the goal.

However, an even shorter path exists: we can move up to (5, 2) then right to (5, 3) is not possible because (5, 3) is a wall, but we can move up to (5, 2) then down to (4, 2) is not possible because (4, 2) is a wall, but we can move up to (5, 2) then down to (4, 3) is possible because (4, 3) is an empty space, then we can move right to (5, 3) is not possible because (5, 3) is a wall, but we can move right to (6, 3) is possible because there is no wall at (6, 3) and (6, 3) is the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2), and (6, 1), and the goal is at (6, 3). The shape formed by these empty spaces is a diagonal line with a small branch.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors)
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is a diagonal line with a small branch, which can be recognized as a "Diagonal Fork".

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same size and shape, we need to generate a new set of empty spaces that form a diagonal line with a small branch.

## Step 4: Generate the new maze
Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (6, 4)

The final answer is: Diagonal Fork
