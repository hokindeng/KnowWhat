You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (6, 1) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and their proximity to the goal
The empty spaces are (4, 1), (4, 3), and (5, 2). The goal is at (6, 3). To move closer to the goal, we should prioritize moving right or diagonally right.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Since the goal is at (6, 3), the best next move from (6, 1) would be to move diagonally right and up to get closer to the goal. However, there are no empty spaces directly diagonally right and up from the current position. The closest empty space that moves us in the general direction of the goal is (5, 2), but moving there directly is not possible as it would require moving through a wall. Therefore, we need to find an alternative route.

## Step 5: Re-evaluate the maze for an alternative route
Given the constraints, the only feasible move from (6, 1) that does not involve moving through a wall is to move up to an empty space that could potentially lead to a path towards the goal. However, since there are no empty spaces directly above (6, 1) that are not blocked by walls, we must reconsider our approach and look for a path that involves moving left or right first.

## Step 6: Consider moving left or right first
Moving left from (6, 1) is not possible because it would require moving through a wall. Therefore, we should consider moving right, but since there are no empty spaces directly to the right of (6, 1), we must look for an alternative.

## Step 7: Look for a diagonal move
Since moving directly up, down, left, or right is not feasible due to the placement of walls and empty spaces, we should consider a diagonal move. However, given the current position and the layout of the maze, a diagonal move that does not involve moving through a wall is not possible.

## Step 8: Reconsider the empty spaces for a viable path
Upon re-examining the maze, it becomes clear that the initial analysis overlooked the potential for moving to (5, 2) as a stepping stone, but given the direct path constraints, we actually need to think about moving in a way that sets us up for future moves towards the goal.

## Step 9: Realize the oversight in initial analysis
The initial analysis was overly focused on direct diagonal moves towards the goal without fully considering the implications of the maze's layout and the potential for using the empty spaces as stepping stones in a less direct path.

## Step 10: Correct the approach based on the maze's layout
Given the layout and the need to avoid walls while moving towards the goal, the correct approach involves moving in a way that utilizes the available empty spaces effectively, even if it means not moving directly towards the goal in the first step.

## Step 11: Identify a viable first move
Considering the need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and utilizing empty spaces, a viable first move would involve positioning ourselves for future moves that can take advantage of the empty spaces (4, 1), (4, 3), and (5, 2) to eventually reach the goal at (6, 3).

## Step 12: Determine the best initial move
Given the constraints and the goal of reaching (6, 3), the best initial move from (6, 1) that sets us up for success involves moving to a position that allows for future moves towards the goal without immediately moving into a wall or an empty space that does not lead towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (6, 1)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (5, 2), and the goal is at position (6, 3). The empty spaces are (4, 1), (4, 3), and (6, 1).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From position (5, 2), the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and their proximity to the goal
The closest empty space to the goal is (6, 1), but moving there directly would not bring us closer to the goal. However, moving to (6, 1) could potentially set us up for a future move towards the goal.

## Step 4: Consider moving towards the goal
Since the goal is at (6, 3), moving right from (5, 2) would bring us closer to the goal. However, there is a wall at (5, 3) and (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), so moving directly right is not possible.

## Step 5: Look for an alternative route
Given the constraints, the only feasible move from (5, 2) that does not involve moving through a wall is to move down to (6, 2) or move left to (4, 2) but both of these moves are blocked by walls. However, moving down to (6, 1) is possible.

## Step 6: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Since moving directly to the goal is not possible, the best next move from (5, 2) would be to move down to (6, 1), which is an empty space and could potentially set us up for a future move towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(6, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (6, 1), and the goal is at position (6, 3). The empty spaces are (4, 1), (4, 3), and (5, 2).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From position (6, 1), the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and their proximity to the goal
The closest empty space to the goal is not directly accessible, but moving right from (6, 1) would bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Consider moving towards the goal
Since the goal is at (6, 3), moving right from (6, 1) would bring us closer to the goal. However, there is a wall at (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), and (6, 6), so moving directly right is not possible for two spaces, but moving one space to the right is possible if we consider moving to a position that is not directly on the path to the goal but could potentially set us up for a future move.

## Step 5: Look for an alternative route
Given the constraints, the only feasible move from (6, 1) that does not involve moving through a wall is to move right to (6, 2) but that space is a wall, so we need to think about moving in a way that sets us up for future moves towards the goal.

## Step 6: Consider moving up or down
Moving up or down from (6, 1) is not possible because it would require moving through a wall or out of the maze boundaries.

## Step 7: Re-evaluate the maze for an alternative route
Given the constraints, we need to think about moving in a way that utilizes the available empty spaces effectively, even if it means not moving directly towards the goal in the first step.

## Step 8: Identify a viable next move
Considering the need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and utilizing empty spaces, a viable next move would involve positioning ourselves for future moves that can take advantage of the empty spaces (4, 1), (4, 3), and (5, 2) to eventually reach the goal at (6, 3).

## Step 9: Determine the best next move
Given the constraints and the goal of reaching (6, 3), the best next move from (6, 1) would be to move to a position that allows for future moves towards the goal without immediately moving into a wall or an empty space that does not lead towards the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From position (6, 1), the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and their proximity to the goal
The closest empty space to the goal is not directly accessible, but moving right from (6, 1) would bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Consider moving towards the goal
Since the goal is at (6, 3), moving right from (6, 1) would bring us closer to the goal. However, there is a wall at (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), and (6, 6), so moving directly right is not possible for two spaces, but moving one space to the right is not possible because of the wall at (6, 2).

Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (5, 2), and the goal is at position (6, 3). The empty spaces are (4, 1), (4, 3), and (6, 1).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From position (5, 2), the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and their proximity to the goal
The closest empty space to the goal is (6, 1), and moving there directly would bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Consider moving towards the goal
Since the goal is at (6, 3), moving right from (5, 2) would bring us closer to the goal. However, there is a wall at (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), and (5, 6), so moving directly right is not possible.

## Step 5: Look for an alternative route
Given the constraints, the only feasible move from (5, 2) that does not involve moving through a wall is to move right to (6, 2) but that space is a wall, so we need to think about moving in a way that sets us up for future moves towards the goal.

## Step 6: Consider moving up or down
Moving up or down from (5, 2) is not possible because it would require moving through a wall or out of the maze boundaries.

## Step 7: Re-evaluate the maze for an alternative route
Given the constraints, we need to think about moving in a way that utilizes the available empty spaces effectively, even if it means not moving directly towards the goal in the first step.

## Step 8: Identify a viable next move
Considering the need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and utilizing empty spaces, a viable next move would involve positioning ourselves for future moves that can take advantage of the empty spaces (4, 1), (4, 3), and (6, 1) to eventually reach the goal at (6, 3).

## Step 9: Determine the best next move
Given the constraints and the goal of reaching (6, 3), the best next move from (5, 2) would be to move to a position that allows for future moves towards the goal without immediately moving into a wall or an empty space that does not lead towards the goal.

## Step 10: Realize the oversight in initial analysis
Upon re-examining the maze, it becomes clear that the initial analysis overlooked the potential for moving to (6, 1) as a stepping stone, which could potentially set us up for a future move towards the goal.

## Step 11: Correct the approach based on the maze's layout
Given the layout and the need to avoid walls while moving towards the goal, the correct approach involves moving in a way that utilizes the available empty spaces effectively, even if it means not moving directly towards the goal in the first step.

## Step 12: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Since moving directly to the goal is not possible, the best next move from (5, 2) would be to move to (6, 1), which is an empty space and could potentially set us up for a future move towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(6, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

## Step 8: Determine the best next move
Given the constraints and the goal of reaching (6, 3), the best next move from (6, 1) would be to move to a position that allows for future moves towards the goal without immediately moving into a wall or an empty space that does not lead towards the goal.

## Step 9: Realize the oversight in initial analysis
Upon re-examining the maze, it becomes clear that the initial analysis overlooked the potential for moving to (5, 2) as a stepping stone, but given the direct path constraints, we actually need to think about moving in a way that sets us up for future moves towards the goal.

## Step 10: Correct the approach based on the maze's layout
Given the layout and the need to avoid walls while moving towards the goal, the correct approach involves moving in a way that utilizes the available empty spaces effectively, even if it means not moving directly towards the goal in the first step.

## Step 11: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Since moving directly to the goal is not possible, the best next move from (6, 1) would be to move to (5, 2), which is an empty space and could potentially set us up for a future move towards the goal.

Considering the need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and utilizing empty spaces, a viable next move would involve positioning ourselves for future moves that can take advantage of the empty spaces (4, 1), (4, 3), and (5, 2) to eventually reach the goal at (6, 3).

## Step 8: Determine the best next move
Given the constraints and the goal of reaching (6, 3), the best next move from (6, 1) would be to move to a position that allows for future moves towards the goal without immediately moving into a wall or an empty space that does not lead towards the goal.

## Step 9: Realize the oversight in initial analysis
Upon re-examining the maze, it becomes clear that the initial analysis overlooked the potential for moving to (5, 2) as a stepping stone, but given the direct path constraints, we actually need to think about moving in a way that sets us up for future moves towards the goal.

## Step 10: Correct the approach based on the maze's layout
Given the layout and the need to avoid walls while moving towards the goal, the correct approach involves moving in a way that utilizes the available empty spaces effectively, even if it means not moving directly towards the goal in the first step.

## Step 11: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Since moving directly to the goal is not possible, the best next move from (6, 1) would be to move to (5, 2), which is an empty space and could potentially set us up for a future move towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (6, 1)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (5, 2), and the goal is at position (6, 3). The empty spaces are (4, 1), (4, 3), and (6, 1).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From position (5, 2), the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and their proximity to the goal
The closest empty space to the goal is (6, 1), and moving there directly would bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Consider moving towards the goal
Since the goal is at (6, 3), moving right from (5, 2) would bring us closer to the goal. However, there is a wall at (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), and (5, 6), so moving directly right is not possible.

## Step 5: Look for an alternative route
Given the constraints, the only feasible move from (5, 2) that does not involve moving through a wall is to move right to (6, 2) but that space is a wall, so we need to think about moving in a way that sets us up for future moves towards the goal.

## Step 6: Consider moving up or down
Moving up or down from (5, 2) is not possible because it would require moving through a wall or out of the maze boundaries.

## Step 7: Re-evaluate the maze for an alternative route
Given the constraints, we need to think about moving in a way that utilizes the available empty spaces effectively, even if it means not moving directly towards the goal in the first step.

## Step 8: Identify a viable next move
Considering the need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and utilizing empty spaces, a viable next move would involve positioning ourselves for future moves that can take advantage of the empty spaces (4, 1), (4, 3), and (6, 1) to eventually reach the goal at (6, 3).

## Step 9: Determine the best next move
Given the constraints and the goal of reaching (6, 3), the best next move from (5, 2) would be to move to a position that allows for future moves towards the goal without immediately moving into a wall or an empty space that does not lead towards the goal.

## Step 10: Realize the oversight in initial analysis
Upon re-examining the maze, it becomes clear that the initial analysis overlooked the potential for moving to (6, 1) as a stepping stone, which could potentially set us up for a future move towards the goal.

## Step 11: Correct the approach based on the maze's layout
Given the layout and the need to avoid walls while moving towards the goal, the correct approach involves moving in a way that utilizes the available empty spaces effectively, even if it means not moving directly towards the goal in the first step.

## Step 12: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Since moving directly to the goal is not possible, the best next move from (5, 2) would be to move to (6, 1), which is an empty space and could potentially set us up for a future move towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(6, 1)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze.
The original maze has empty spaces at (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2), and (6, 1). These spaces form a general shape that can be described as a "zigzag" or "staircase" shape.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape.
To create a new maze with the same shape, we can start by placing the player (P) and goal (G) in the same positions as the original maze. Then, we can create a zigzag or staircase shape using empty spaces, making sure to avoid creating a path that is identical to the original maze.

Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

The final answer is: $\boxed{zigzag}$
