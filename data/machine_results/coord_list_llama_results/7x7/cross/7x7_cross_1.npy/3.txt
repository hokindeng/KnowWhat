You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we need to navigate from the player position (6, 1) to the goal position (6, 3) while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces. Given the constraints and the layout of the maze, we can see that the direct path to the goal is blocked by walls, and we have limited options for movement due to the sparse distribution of empty spaces.

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that there is a path that allows us to reach the goal by moving diagonally and horizontally through the available empty spaces. The path involves moving from the player position (6, 1) to the empty space (5, 2), and then finding a way to reach the goal (6, 3) from there.

Given the current position (6, 1) and the goal (6, 3), and considering the available empty spaces, the next logical move would be to move diagonally to the empty space (5, 2), as it is the only viable step towards reaching the goal without hitting a wall.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (5, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (6, 1)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we are at position (5, 2), we need to find a way to reach the goal (6, 3). However, we can see that the direct path to the goal is blocked by walls.

Upon examining the available empty spaces, we notice that we can move to (4, 3), which is an empty space that is adjacent to our current position. From there, we can reassess our options to reach the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (5, 2), (6, 1)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we are at position (4, 3), we need to find a way to reach the goal (6, 3). We can see that we are getting closer to the goal, but we still need to navigate through the available empty spaces.

Upon examining the available empty spaces, we notice that we can move to (5, 2), which is an empty space that we previously visited. From there, we can reassess our options to reach the goal.

However, we can also see that moving to (5, 2) would be a step back, and we would be retracing our steps. Instead, we can try to move to (6, 1), which is an empty space that is closer to the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are (6, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form an L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (3, 6)

Note that this new maze has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape.
