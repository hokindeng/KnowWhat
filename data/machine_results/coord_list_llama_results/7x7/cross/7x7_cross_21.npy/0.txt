You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (3, 0) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and the goal position
The empty spaces are (1, 0), (1, 2), and (2, 1), and the goal position is (3, 2). Since the goal is to reach (3, 2) from (3, 0), we need to find a path that connects these two points through the empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Since the goal position is (3, 2) and the current player position is (3, 0), the most direct move would be to move up and to the right, but given the constraints of the maze, we can see that moving directly to (3, 2) is not possible due to the walls. However, we can move to (2, 1) which is an empty space and then reassess the next move from there.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal, the next move should be to (2, 1) as it is the only available move that brings us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 2), (3, 0)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (2, 1), and the goal is to reach position (3, 2). We need to analyze the available empty spaces and the walls to determine the next move.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (2, 1) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and the goal position
The empty spaces are (1, 0), (1, 2), and (3, 0), and the goal position is (3, 2). Since the goal is to reach (3, 2) from (2, 1), we need to find a path that connects these two points through the empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Since the goal position is (3, 2) and the current player position is (2, 1), the most direct move would be to move down and to the right. However, we can see that moving directly to (3, 2) is not possible due to the walls. But we can move to (3, 0) which is an empty space and then reassess the next move from there.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal, the next move should be to (3, 0) as it is the only available move that brings us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

## Step 6: Reassess the next move from (3, 0)
From (3, 0), we can move up to (3, 1) but it's a wall, so we can move up and to the right to (3, 2) but there is no empty space to the right of (3, 0), however we can move up and to the left to (2, 2) but there is a wall at (2, 2), so we can move up and to the left to (1, 2) but it's not the best option, so we can move up to (3, 1) but it's a wall, so the best option is to move up and to the right to (3, 2) but we need to find a way to get there.

## Step 7: Find a way to get to (3, 2)
We can move up to (3, 1) but it's a wall, so we can move up and to the left to (2, 2) but there is a wall at (2, 2), so we can move up and to the left to (1, 2) but it's not the best option, so we can move up to (3, 1) but it's a wall, so the best option is to move up and to the right to (3, 2) but we need to find a way to get there.

## Step 8: Find an alternative way to get to (3, 2)
We can move up and to the left to (1, 2) and then move down and to the right to (3, 2).

## Step 9: Choose the next move
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal, the next move should be to (1, 2) as it is the only available move that brings us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

The empty spaces are (1, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 0), and the goal position is (3, 2). Since the goal is to reach (3, 2) from (1, 2), we need to find a path that connects these two points through the empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Since the goal position is (3, 2) and the current player position is (1, 2), the most direct move would be to move down and to the right. However, we can see that moving directly to (3, 2) is not possible due to the walls. But we can move down to (2, 2) but it's a wall, so we can move down and to the left to (2, 1) which is an empty space.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1), and (3, 0), with the goal at (3, 2). The shape formed by these empty spaces is a diagonal line with a small branch.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors)
The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "Diagonal Line with a Branch".

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze, we will keep the same size (7x7) and create a new set of empty spaces that form a diagonal line with a branch.

## Step 4: Define the new set of empty spaces
The new set of empty spaces will be: (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 6) for the diagonal line, and (2, 1), (3, 2), and (4, 3) for the branch.

## Step 5: Define the new set of walls
The new set of walls will be all the remaining spaces that are not empty.

## Step 6: Define the new player position and goal
The new player position will be (0, 0) and the new goal will be (6, 6).

## Step 7: Encode the new maze
The new maze will be encoded as follows:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (6, 6)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal Line with a Branch}$
