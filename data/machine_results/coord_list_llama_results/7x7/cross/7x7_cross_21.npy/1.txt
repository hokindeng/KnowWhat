You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (3, 0) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and the goal position
The empty spaces are (1, 0), (1, 2), and (2, 1), and the goal position is (3, 2). Since the goal is to reach (3, 2) from (3, 0), we need to find a path that connects these two points through the empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Since the goal position is (3, 2) and the current player position is (3, 0), the most direct move would be to move up and to the right, but given the constraints of the maze and the available empty spaces, the best initial move is to move up to the empty space that is closest to the goal and not blocked by walls.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Given the layout and the goal, moving directly to (3, 2) is not possible due to the walls. However, moving to (2, 1) is not a direct path to the goal but is an available move. The best move towards the goal, considering the maze constraints, is actually to move to (2, 1) as it is the only available move that brings us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 2), (3, 0)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is now at position (2, 1), and the goal is still at position (3, 2). We need to find a path from the current position to the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current position (2, 1) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and the goal position
The empty spaces are (1, 0), (1, 2), and (3, 0), and the goal position is (3, 2). Since the goal is to reach (3, 2) from (2, 1), we need to find a path that connects these two points through the empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Since the goal position is (3, 2) and the current player position is (2, 1), the most direct move would be to move down and to the right. However, given the constraints of the maze and the available empty spaces, the best move is to move down to the empty space that is closest to the goal and not blocked by walls.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Given the layout and the goal, moving directly to (3, 2) is not possible due to the walls. However, moving to (3, 0) is not a direct path to the goal but is an available move. The best move towards the goal, considering the maze constraints, is actually to move to (3, 0) as it is the only available move that brings us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

## Step 6: Realize the mistake in the previous step
Moving to (3, 0) would actually be a step back from the goal, as we would be moving away from the y-coordinate of the goal.

## Step 7: Re-evaluate the possible moves
Considering the empty spaces and the goal position, the best move would be to move to a position that is closer to the goal. Since we cannot move directly to the goal, we should try to move to a position that is adjacent to the goal.

## Step 8: Choose the correct next move
Given the layout and the goal, the best move is to move to (1, 2) is not possible as it would require moving through a wall, but moving to (3, 0) is also not ideal. However, there is no other empty space that is closer to the goal. We should try to move to a position that is adjacent to the goal, but since there are no available empty spaces, we should try to move to a position that is closer to the goal in the x or y direction.

## Step 9: Realize that there is no direct path to the goal
Given the constraints of the maze, there is no direct path to the goal. We should try to move to a position that is closer to the goal in the x or y direction.

## Step 10: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Given the layout and the goal, the best move is to move to (3, 0) is not ideal, but moving to (1, 2) is not possible. However, we can move to (1, 0) which is not closer to the goal, but it is the only available move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 0)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is now at position (1, 0), and the goal is still at position (3, 2). We need to find a path from the current position to the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current position (1, 0) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and the goal position
The empty spaces are (1, 2), (2, 1), and (3, 0), and the goal position is (3, 2). Since the goal is to reach (3, 2) from (1, 0), we need to find a path that connects these two points through the empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Since the goal position is (3, 2) and the current player position is (1, 0), the most direct move would be to move down and to the right. However, given the constraints of the maze and the available empty spaces, the best move is to move to the empty space that is closest to the goal and not blocked by walls.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Given the layout and the goal, moving directly to (3, 2) is not possible due to the walls. However, moving to (2, 1) is a possible move that brings us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

## Step 6: Realize that moving to (2, 1) is a good option
Moving to (2, 1) is a good option because it brings us closer to the goal and it is not blocked by walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 2), (3, 0)

Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is now at position (2, 1), and the goal is still at position (3, 2). We need to find a path from the current position to the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current position (2, 1) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and the goal position
The empty spaces are (1, 0), (1, 2), and (3, 0), and the goal position is (3, 2). Since the goal is to reach (3, 2) from (2, 1), we need to find a path that connects these two points through the empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Since the goal position is (3, 2) and the current player position is (2, 1), the most direct move would be to move down and to the right. However, given the constraints of the maze and the available empty spaces, the best move is to move to the empty space that is closest to the goal and not blocked by walls.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Given the layout and the goal, moving directly to (3, 2) is not possible due to the walls. However, moving to (1, 2) is a possible move that brings us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

## Step 6: Realize that moving to (1, 2) is a good option
Moving to (1, 2) is a good option because it brings us closer to the goal and it is not blocked by walls.

## Step 7: Consider alternative moves
However, moving to (3, 0) is also a possible move that brings us closer to the goal in the x-direction.

## Step 8: Choose the best move
Considering the options, moving to (3, 0) is a better move because it brings us closer to the goal in the x-direction and sets us up for a potential move to the goal in the next step.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 0)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1)

Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is now at position (3, 0), and the goal is still at position (3, 2). We need to find a path from the current position to the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current position (3, 0) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and the goal position
The empty spaces are (1, 0), (1, 2), and (2, 1), and the goal position is (3, 2). Since the goal is to reach (3, 2) from (3, 0), we need to find a path that connects these two points through the empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Since the goal position is (3, 2) and the current player position is (3, 0), the most direct move would be to move up.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Given the layout and the goal, moving up is the best option because it brings us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

## Step 6: Realize that moving up is not possible
However, moving up is not possible because the space above the current position is a wall.

## Step 7: Consider alternative moves
Considering the options, moving to (2, 1) is a possible move that brings us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

## Step 8: Choose the best move
However, moving to (2, 1) would be a step back from the goal. Since we cannot move up, we should try to move to a position that is closer to the goal in the y-direction.

## Step 9: Realize that there is no direct path to the goal
Given the constraints of the maze, there is no direct path to the goal. We should try to move to a position that is closer to the goal in the y-direction.

## Step 10: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Given the layout and the goal, moving to (2, 1) is not ideal, but it is the only available move that brings us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

Empty: (1, 0), (1, 2), (3, 0)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is now at position (2, 1), and the goal is still at position (3, 2). We need to find a path from the current position to the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current position (2, 1) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and the goal position
The empty spaces are (1, 0), (1, 2), and (3, 0), and the goal position is (3, 2). Since the goal is to reach (3, 2) from (2, 1), we need to find a path that connects these two points through the empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Since the goal position is (3, 2) and the current player position is (2, 1), the most direct move would be to move to the right and up.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Given the layout and the goal, moving to (1, 2) is a possible move that brings us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

## Step 6: Realize that moving to (1, 2) is a good option
Moving to (1, 2) is a good option because it brings us closer to the goal and it is not blocked by walls.

## Step 7: Consider alternative moves
However, moving to (1, 2) would be a step back from the goal in the x-direction. We should try to move to a position that is closer to the goal in the x-direction.

## Step 8: Choose the best move
Considering the options, moving to (3, 0) is a possible move that brings us closer to the goal in the x-direction.

## Step 9: Realize that moving to (3, 0) is a good option
Moving to (3, 0) is a good option because it brings us closer to the goal in the x-direction and it is not blocked by walls.

## Step 10: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Given the layout and the goal, moving to (3, 0) is the best option.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 0)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is now at position (3, 0), and the goal is still at position (3, 2). We need to find a path from the current position to the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current position (3, 0) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces and the goal position
The empty spaces are (1, 0), (1, 2), and (2, 1), and the goal position is (3, 2). Since the goal is to reach (3, 2) from (3, 0), we need to find a path that connects these two points through the empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Since the goal position is (3, 2) and the current player position is (3, 0), the most direct move would be to move up.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Given the layout and the goal, moving up is the best option because it brings us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

## Step 6: Realize that moving up is not possible
However, moving up is not possible because the space above the current position is a wall.

## Step 7: Consider alternative moves
Considering the options, moving to (2, 1) is a possible move that brings us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

## Step 8: Choose the best move
However, moving to (2, 1) would be a step back from the goal in the x-direction. We should try to move to a position that is closer to the goal in the y-direction.

## Step 9: Realize that there is no direct path to the goal
Given the constraints of the maze, there is no direct path to the goal. We should try to move to a position that is closer to the goal in the y-direction.

## Step 10: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Given the layout and the goal, moving to (2, 1) is not ideal, but it is the only available move that brings us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 1)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1), and (3, 0), which form a general shape that can be recognized as a "zigzag" or "staircase" shape.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same size and shape
To generate a new maze with the same size and shape, we can create a new set of empty spaces that form a zigzag or staircase shape. Here is an example of a new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (5, 0)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as a zigzag or staircase shape.

The final answer is: $\boxed{zigzag}$
