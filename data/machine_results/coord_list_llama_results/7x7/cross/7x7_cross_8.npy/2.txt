You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (2, 4), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the adjacent empty spaces
From the given maze, we can see that the empty spaces are (0, 2), (0, 4), and (1, 3). However, only (1, 3) is adjacent to the current player position (2, 4).

## Step 4: Determine the best move to make
Since the goal position is (2, 2), we should try to move closer to it. The adjacent empty space (1, 3) is not directly closer to the goal, but it is the only available move that does not involve moving into a wall or an occupied space.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to the adjacent empty space (1, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (1, 3), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the adjacent empty spaces
From the given maze, we can see that the empty spaces are (0, 2), (0, 4), and (2, 4). However, only (2, 4) and (0, 4) are two spaces away from the current player position, but (0, 2) is closer and only two spaces away diagonally from the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the best move to make
Since the goal position is (2, 2), we should try to move closer to it. The adjacent empty space (0, 2) is closer to the goal and is a better option.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to the adjacent empty space (0, 2) but since it is two spaces away, we should move to the space that is one space away from (0, 2) and also closer to the goal.

## Step 6: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to the space (0, 3) but it is a wall, so we should move to the space that is one space away from (0, 2) and also closer to the goal which is not available, so we move to the space (0, 4) is not closer to the goal than (2, 4) but (2, 4) is closer to the goal than (0, 4), so we move to (2, 4) then to (2, 3) then to (2, 2).

## Step 7: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to the adjacent empty space (2, 4).

## Step 8: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to the adjacent empty space (2, 3).

## Step 9: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to the adjacent empty space (2, 2) which is the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (2, 4), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the adjacent empty spaces
From the given maze, we can see that the empty spaces are (0, 2), (0, 4), and (1, 3). However, only (1, 3) is adjacent to the current player position.

## Step 4: Determine the best move to make
Since the goal position is (2, 2), we should try to move closer to it. However, moving to (1, 3) would take us away from the goal. Instead, we can move to the space (2, 3) which is closer to the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to the space (2, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 3)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The original maze has empty spaces at (0, 2), (0, 4), and (1, 3), and (2, 4). The general shape formed by these empty spaces is a "L-shape" or a "corner" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to place the empty spaces in a way that forms an L-shape or a corner shape. We can place the empty spaces at (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3), and (3, 3) to form an L-shape.

## Step 3: Ensure the new maze meets the criteria
The new maze should have the same size as the original maze, which is 7x7. It should also include a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. We can place the player position at (1, 1) and the goal position at (3, 3) to ensure a valid path.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Here is the new maze encoded in the same format as the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$
