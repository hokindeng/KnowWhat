You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (2, 4), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the closest empty space to the goal
From the given maze, we can see that the goal position is (2, 2). We need to find the closest empty space to the goal that is also adjacent to the current player position.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Based on the analysis, the closest empty space to the goal that is adjacent to the current player position is (2, 3) and then (2, 2) is not directly reachable, but (1, 3) is an empty space that can lead us closer to the goal. However, since we are at (2, 4) and need to get to (2, 2), moving to (2, 3) is not an option as it's not provided as an empty space, so we look for the next best option which is moving diagonally or directly towards the goal if possible. Given the constraints, moving to (1, 3) is the best option as it brings us closer to the goal and is an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (1, 3), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the closest empty space to the goal
From the given maze, we can see that the goal position is (2, 2). We need to find the closest empty space to the goal that is also adjacent to the current player position.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Based on the analysis, the closest empty space to the goal that is adjacent to the current player position is not directly reachable. However, since we are at (1, 3) and need to get to (2, 2), moving to (2, 4) is an option as it brings us closer to the goal and is an empty space, but it's not the most direct path. Since there are no other empty spaces adjacent to (1, 3) that lead directly to the goal, we have to choose between moving back to (2, 4) or trying to find another path. Given the constraints, moving to (2, 4) is the best option as it brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 4)}$

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Based on the analysis, the closest empty space to the goal that is adjacent to the current player position is not directly reachable. However, since we are at (2, 4) and need to get to (2, 2), moving to (1, 3) is an option as it brings us closer to the goal and is an empty space. This move will allow us to potentially move to the goal in the next step.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Based on the analysis, the closest empty space to the goal that is adjacent to the current player position is (2, 2) itself, but it's not directly reachable as it's not listed as an empty space. However, since we are at (1, 3) and need to get to (2, 2), moving to (2, 4) is not an option as it would move us away from the goal. We need to find another path. Since there are no other empty spaces adjacent to (1, 3) that lead directly to the goal, we have to choose between moving back or trying to find another path. Given the constraints, moving to (0, 2) is not an option as it would move us away from the goal, so we have to try to find another path.

## Step 5: Re-evaluate the maze
Upon re-evaluation, we notice that there is no direct path to the goal from the current position. However, we can try to move to a position that would allow us to potentially move to the goal in the next step.

## Step 6: Determine the next move
Based on the analysis, the closest empty space to the goal that is adjacent to the current player position is not directly reachable. However, since we are at (1, 3) and need to get to (2, 2), moving to (0, 4) is not an option as it would move us away from the goal. We need to find another path. Since there are no other empty spaces adjacent to (1, 3) that lead directly to the goal, we have to choose between moving back or trying to find another path. Given the constraints, moving to (2, 4) is the best option as it brings us closer to the goal, but it's not the most direct path.

Given the current player position is (2, 4), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the closest empty space to the goal
From the given maze, we can see that the goal position is (2, 2). We need to find the closest empty space to the goal that is also adjacent to the current player position.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Based on the analysis, the closest empty space to the goal that is adjacent to the current player position is not directly reachable. However, since we are at (2, 4) and need to get to (2, 2), moving to (1, 3) is an option as it brings us closer to the goal and is an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze.
The original maze has empty spaces that form a zigzag or winding path.

## Step 2: Create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form the same shape.
Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (6, 4)

The final answer is: $\boxed{zigzag}$
