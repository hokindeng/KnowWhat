You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we need to navigate from the player position (2, 4) to the goal position (2, 2) while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces. Given the constraints and the maze layout, the optimal first move would be to move diagonally or directly towards the goal if possible, or to move in a way that opens up the most possibilities for the next move.

Given the current position (2, 4) and the goal (2, 2), and considering the empty spaces provided, the most direct path to the goal involves moving through the empty spaces in a way that minimizes the number of steps and avoids walls.

Since the goal is directly to the left of the current position but is blocked by walls, we need to find an alternative route. The empty space at (1, 3) is the closest to the goal and our current position that we can move to, which would then allow us to potentially move down towards the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 3), as it is an empty space that is adjacent to our current position and moves us closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

Next move: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze, we are now at position (1, 3) and our goal is to reach (2, 2). Since we cannot move directly to the goal due to the wall at (2, 3), we need to find an alternative route.

Looking at the available empty spaces, we can see that (0, 2) and (0, 4) are not directly connected to our current position or the goal, so they are not immediately useful for our next move.

However, we can see that moving down to (2, 3) is not possible due to the wall, but we can try to move down to (2, 4) which is an empty space and then try to find a way to move left to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 4), as it is an empty space that is adjacent to our current position and moves us closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

Next move: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We are now back at position (2, 4) and our goal is still to reach (2, 2). Since we cannot move directly to the goal due to the wall at (2, 3), we need to find an alternative route.

However, I notice that we are back at the starting position, and we didn't make any progress towards the goal. Let me re-evaluate the situation.

Since we are at (2, 4) and the goal is at (2, 2), we can try to move left to (2, 3) and then down to (2, 2) if possible. However, (2, 3) is a wall, so we cannot move left.

In this case, I will try to move up to (1, 4) which is not an option since (1, 4) is a wall. However, I can move up to (1, 3) which is an empty space.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 3), as it is an empty space that is adjacent to our current position and might give us a new opportunity to move towards the goal.

Next move: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We are now back at position (1, 3) and our goal is still to reach (2, 2). Since we cannot move directly to the goal due to the wall at (2, 3), we need to find an alternative route.

Looking at the available empty spaces, I notice that (0, 2) and (0, 4) are not directly connected to our current position or the goal, so they are not immediately useful for our next move.

However, I can see that moving down to (2, 3) is not possible due to the wall, but I can try to move down to (2, 4) which is an empty space. From there, I might be able to find a way to move left to the goal.

But wait, I already tried that and it didn't work. Let me think again.

Since I'm at (1, 3) and the goal is at (2, 2), I can try to move down to (2, 3) and then left to (2, 2) if possible. However, (2, 3) is a wall, so I need to find another way.

In this case, I will try to move down to (2, 4) and then try to find a way to move left to the goal. But this time, I will think about it differently.

I will move down to (2, 4) and then try to move left to (2, 3) and then up to (1, 3) and then left to (1, 2) and then down to (2, 2). But this is a long way and I'm not sure if it will work.

Let me think again.

 Ah-ha! I have an idea. I will move down to (2, 4) and then try to move left to (2, 3) and then... no, that won't work.

Wait, I have another idea. I will move up to (0, 3) and then... no, that's a wall.

Let me think again.

 Ah-ha! I have an idea. I will move up to (0, 3) and then... no, that's a wall.

Wait, I have another idea. I will move left to (1, 2) and then... yes! That might work.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 2), as it is an empty space that is adjacent to our current position and might give us a new opportunity to move towards the goal.

Next move: (1, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (6, 6)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original maze, and the empty spaces form an L-shape that is recognizable as the same shape as the original maze. The path from P to G can be reached through the empty spaces, and the maze is not an identical copy of the original maze.
