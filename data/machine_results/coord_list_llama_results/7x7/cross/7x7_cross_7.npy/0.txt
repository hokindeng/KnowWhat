You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (4, 2), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine the best next move
Looking at the maze, we can see that the goal position (2, 2) is located above and to the left of the current player position. Since we can move diagonally, the best next move would be to move diagonally up and to the left.

## Step 4: Determine the coordinates of the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move would be to move diagonally up and to the left from the current player position (4, 2). This would put us at position (3, 1).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has been updated to reflect the new player position (3, 1). We need to analyze the current state of the maze to determine the best next move.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
From the current player position (3, 1), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine the best next move
Looking at the maze, we can see that the goal position (2, 2) is located above and to the left of the current player position. However, there is a wall at position (2, 1), so we cannot move directly up. We can move up and to the left diagonally, but we would need to move to an empty space first.

## Step 4: Determine the coordinates of the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move would be to move up to the empty space at position (2, 0). This would put us closer to the goal position and allow us to make further moves.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 0)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)

Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has been updated to reflect the new player position (2, 0). We need to analyze the current state of the maze to determine the best next move.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
From the current player position (2, 0), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine the best next move
Looking at the maze, we can see that the goal position (2, 2) is located above the current player position. However, there is a wall at position (2, 1), so we cannot move directly up. We need to find an alternative route to reach the goal position.

## Step 4: Determine the coordinates of the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move would be to move right to the empty space at position (3, 1) and then try to find a way up to the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 1)}$

## Step 4: Determine the coordinates of the next move

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze.
The original maze has empty spaces at positions (2, 0), (3, 1), and (4, 0), (4, 2). The general shape formed by these empty spaces is an "L" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape as the original maze.
To create a new maze with the same shape, we can rotate the original maze by 90 degrees clockwise. This will result in a new maze with the same size and shape.

## Step 3: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original.
The new maze will have the following walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L}$
