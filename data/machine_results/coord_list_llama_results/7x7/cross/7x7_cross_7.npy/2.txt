You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (4, 2), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we need to check which of these moves are valid by ensuring the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine valid moves
Looking at the maze, the current player position (4, 2) is surrounded by walls on most sides. The only valid move from this position is to move up to the empty space at (3, 2) or to move diagonally up-left to (3, 1), which is also an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (2, 2) and the available moves, moving diagonally up-left to (3, 1) is the most efficient next step. This move brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current situation
The player is now at position (3, 1), and the goal is at position (2, 2). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From the current position (3, 1), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to an adjacent empty space. However, we must avoid walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze for valid moves
Looking at the maze, moving up to (2, 1) is a valid move since it is not a wall. Additionally, moving diagonally up-right to (2, 2) is also a valid move, which would directly reach the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since moving diagonally up-right to (2, 2) directly reaches the goal and is a valid move, this is the most efficient next step.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 2)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 0), (3, 1), and (4, 0), (4, 2). Given the positions of these empty spaces, the general shape formed by the corridors can be described as a "L-shape" or more specifically, a "staircase" shape, but considering the overall path and the goal, it resembles more a "L-shape" with the addition of a single step to the right.

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure it has a similar L-shape with an additional step to the right for the path. The new maze should be of the same size (7x7) and include a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal for the new maze
Walls: Most of the original walls will be kept to maintain the overall structure, but some will be adjusted to create a new path.
Empty: The new empty spaces will form an L-shape with an additional step to the right, similar to the original maze but not identical.
Player position: The player will start at a position that allows for a valid path to the goal.
Goal: The goal will be placed at the end of the L-shape path.

## Step 4: Specify the new maze
Given the constraints and the need to create a new maze with the same shape, here is a possible new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

This new maze maintains the L-shape with an additional step to the right for the path, ensuring a valid path from the player position to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$
