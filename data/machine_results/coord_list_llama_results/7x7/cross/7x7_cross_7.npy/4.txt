You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (4, 2), we need to identify the possible adjacent empty spaces where we can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine the available moves
From the given maze, we can see that the current player position (4, 2) is surrounded by walls on the right and bottom sides. The only available move is to go up or left.

## Step 4: Choose the best move to get closer to the goal
Since the goal position is (2, 2), we need to move up and left to get closer to the goal. The best move would be to go up to the position (3, 2) or left to the position (4, 1) and then up. However, since (3, 2) is not an empty space, we will choose to go left to the position (4, 1) and then reassess our next move.

## Step 5: Determine the next move
However, upon reevaluation, considering the constraints and the goal, moving left to (4, 1) does not directly lead us to the goal due to the wall at (3, 2). The correct approach should involve moving towards the goal while avoiding walls, which means considering diagonal moves or finding an alternative path around the walls.

## Step 6: Reassess the maze for an optimal path
Given the constraints and the layout, a more optimal first move considering the goal's position and the maze's layout would be to move diagonally or find a path that leads directly towards the goal without immediate obstruction by walls.

## Step 7: Correct the approach based on the maze's specifics
Upon a detailed review, considering the direct path to the goal and the positions of the walls, the initial analysis overlooked the direct path due to focusing on immediate adjacent squares rather than the overall path to the goal.

## Step 8: Finalize the next move based on the corrected approach
Given the goal is at (2, 2) and the current position is (4, 2), and considering the maze's layout, the best move is actually to move up-left diagonally towards the goal, but since diagonal moves were considered but not directly applied in the initial steps, the focus should be on moving in a direction that aligns with reaching the goal while avoiding walls, which means moving left or finding a path around the walls to get closer to the goal.

## Step 9: Correctly identify the next move
Given the constraints and the goal, moving directly towards the goal while avoiding walls is the priority. However, the detailed step-by-step analysis led to an oversight in directly applying the optimal move based on the maze's layout and the goal's position.

## Step 10: Final analysis for the optimal next move
Considering the maze and the goal, the optimal move from (4, 2) would actually be to move towards the goal in a way that navigates around the walls, which involves moving left or up in a manner that aligns with reaching the goal (2, 2) efficiently.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 2)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 0), (3, 1), and (4, 0). These spaces form a rough "L" shape when connected by possible paths.

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same shape and size as the original
To create a new maze with the same shape and size, we need to ensure it has the same dimensions (7x7) and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The new maze should also form an "L" shape with its empty spaces.

## Step 3: Determine the positions of the walls and empty spaces in the new maze
To form an "L" shape, we can place empty spaces at positions that create a vertical line and a horizontal line that intersect, similar to the original maze but not identical.

## Step 4: Choose the positions for the player (P) and the goal (G)
The player position (P) and the goal position (G) should be placed in a way that creates a solvable path between them using the empty spaces.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original
We will list the coordinates of the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position.

## Step 6: Ensure the new maze meets all the criteria
The new maze should have the same size as the original, include a valid path from P to G, not be an identical copy of the original, and form an "L" shape with its empty spaces.

The final answer is: 

(1) L-shape

(2) Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 0)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)
