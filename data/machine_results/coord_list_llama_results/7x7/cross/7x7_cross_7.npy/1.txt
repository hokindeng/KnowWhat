You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (4, 2), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we need to check which of these moves are valid by ensuring the destination space is empty and not a wall.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine valid moves
Looking at the maze, the current position (4, 2) is surrounded by walls on most sides. The only valid move from this position is to move up to the empty space at (3, 2) or to move diagonally up-left to (3, 1), which is also an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (2, 2), the most direct path would be to move up. However, since moving diagonally up-left to (3, 1) also brings us closer to the goal and avoids potential dead ends, this could be a strategic move. But, given the direct approach is usually the simplest, moving up to (3, 2) seems like the next logical step.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 2)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 0), (3, 1), and (4, 0), and the goal is at (2, 2) with the player starting at (4, 2). Given these positions, the path that can be formed by connecting these points and considering the goal and start position suggests a general shape that resembles a "L-shape" or a "corner" shape, but more accurately, it can be described as a "staircase" or "zigzag" shape due to the diagonal and vertical movements required to navigate from the start to the goal.

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same shape formed by empty spaces
To create a new maze with the same shape (a "staircase" or "zigzag" shape), we need to ensure that the empty spaces are arranged in a way that allows for a path from the player position to the goal position, following a similar pattern of movements (diagonal and vertical) as in the original maze.

## Step 3: Determine the positions of the empty spaces in the new maze
Given the size of the original maze (7x7), we will create a new maze of the same size. To form a "staircase" or "zigzag" shape, we can place the empty spaces in a diagonal and vertical pattern. For example, starting from the bottom right and moving diagonally up-left, then vertically up.

## Step 4: Choose specific coordinates for the empty spaces, player position, and goal position in the new maze
Let's place the empty spaces at (6, 6), (5, 5), (4, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), and (1, 1) to form the diagonal part of the "staircase". Then, to continue the path vertically, we add empty spaces at (1, 0), (0, 0). The player position can be at (6, 0), and the goal position at (0, 6).

## Step 5: Encode the new maze
Walls: All coordinates not listed as empty spaces or the player/goal positions.
Empty: (6, 6), (5, 5), (4, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (0, 6)

The final answer is: There is no specific numerical answer for this problem as it involves describing a shape and generating a new maze based on that shape.
