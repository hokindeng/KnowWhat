You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (4, 2), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we need to check which of these moves are valid by ensuring the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine valid moves
Looking at the maze, we can see that the current position (4, 2) is surrounded by walls on most sides. The only valid move from this position is to move up to the empty space at (3, 2) or to move diagonally up-left to (3, 1), which is also an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since our goal is to reach the position (2, 2), moving diagonally up-left to (3, 1) would be a more direct path towards the goal while also being a valid move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and the goal
The current player position is (3, 1), and the goal position is (2, 2). We need to navigate from the current position to the goal while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From (3, 1), we can consider moving up, down, left, right, or diagonally to adjacent empty spaces. However, we must ensure that the destination is an empty space and not a wall.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine valid moves
Looking at the maze, moving directly up to (2, 1) is not possible because (2, 1) is a wall. However, moving diagonally up-right to (2, 2) is a valid move since (2, 2) is the goal position and is not a wall.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since moving diagonally up-right to (2, 2) directly reaches the goal position, this is the most direct and valid move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 2)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), and (4, 2). These spaces form a rough "L" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will maintain the same size (7x7) and ensure that the empty spaces form a recognizable "L" shape. We will also ensure that there is a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L}$
