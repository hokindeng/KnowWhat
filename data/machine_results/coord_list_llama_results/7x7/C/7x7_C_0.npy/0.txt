You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since the maze is relatively small, BFS should be sufficient to find the shortest path to the goal.

First, I will analyze the current state of the maze. The player position is (1, 2), and the goal is (4, 3). I will explore the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent empty spaces to (1, 2) are:

* (1, 1)
* (1, 3)

Since the goal is to the right and down, I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. I will move to (1, 3).

My next move is: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current state of the maze. The player position is (1, 3), and the goal is (4, 3). I will explore the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent empty spaces to (1, 3) are:

* (1, 2)
* (1, 4)
* (2, 3) is not available, as it is a wall
* (1, 3) is the current position, so I will not move up or down

Since the goal is to the right, I will move to (1, 4).

My next move is: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the current state of the maze. The player position is (1, 4), and the goal is (4, 3). I will explore the adjacent empty spaces to the current position.

The adjacent empty spaces to (1, 4) are:

* (1, 3)
* (1, 5) is not available, as it is a wall
* (2, 4) is not available, as it is a wall
* (1, 4) is the current position, so I will not move up or down

Since the goal is to the right and down, I will move to (2, 1) is not a good option, as it would move me away from the goal. However, I can move down to (2, 4) is not available, but I can move to (2, 1) and then try to move right. 

My next move is: (2, 1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze has a similar L-shape or bent corridor shape, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The player can navigate from the starting position to the goal by moving through the empty spaces.
