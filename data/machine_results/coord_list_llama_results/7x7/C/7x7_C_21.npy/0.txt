You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (5, 4), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces in the up, down, left, or right direction.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the adjacent empty spaces
Looking at the maze, the adjacent empty spaces to the current player position (5, 4) are (5, 5) and (4, 4).

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the goal position
Since the goal position is (3, 5), we should move towards the left and up direction to reach the goal. Therefore, the next move should be to the left, which is (4, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 4), (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (4, 4), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces in the up, down, left, or right direction.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the adjacent empty spaces
Looking at the maze, the adjacent empty space to the current player position (4, 4) is (3, 4).

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the goal position
Since the goal position is (3, 5), we should move towards the left and up direction to reach the goal. Therefore, the next move should be to the left, which is (3, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (3, 4), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces in the up, down, left, or right direction.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the adjacent empty spaces
Looking at the maze, the adjacent empty space to the current player position (3, 4) is (3, 6) but it is not directly above or below the current position, however (3, 5) is directly above the current position and is the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the goal position
Since the goal position is (3, 5), we should move up to reach the goal. Therefore, the next move should be up, which is (3, 5).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 5)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), and (5, 6). These empty spaces form a general shape that can be recognized as an "L-shape" or a "corner" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape but different layout
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to design a new set of empty spaces that form an "L-shape" or "corner" shape. We will place the new empty spaces in a way that creates a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 6)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$
