You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution, we'll adapt the approach to provide the next move based on the current state of the maze.

Given the current player position (2, 3) and the goal position (4, 3), we need to navigate through the empty spaces while avoiding walls.

The next move should aim to bring the player closer to the goal. Since the goal is located at (4, 3), which is to the right of the current position, we should move in that direction if possible.

Looking at the empty spaces, we see that (3, 3) is available and is directly to the right of the current position (2, 3). Therefore, the next move should be to (3, 3).

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that the player is at position (3, 3), we need to move closer to the goal position (4, 3). However, we notice that the space directly to the right of the current position, (4, 3), is not listed as an empty space. This means that we cannot move directly to the goal position.

Instead, we need to find an alternative route. Looking at the empty spaces, we see that (4, 4) is available and is located below the goal position. We can move down to (4, 4) and then try to find a way to move left to the goal position.

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that the player is at position (4, 4), we need to move closer to the goal position (4, 3). Since the goal is located above the current position, we can move up to reach it.

However, we notice that the space directly above the current position, (4, 3), is not listed as an empty space. This means that we cannot move directly up to the goal position.

But, we can see that the space (3, 3) is empty, and it's located above and to the left of the current position. We can move up and to the left to (3, 3), and then try to find a way to move right to the goal position.

The coordinates of my next move are: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that the player is at position (3, 3), we need to move closer to the goal position (4, 3). Since the goal is located to the right of the current position, we can move right to reach it.

However, we notice that the space directly to the right of the current position, (4, 3), is not listed as an empty space. But, we can see that the space (4, 4) is empty, and it's located to the right and below the current position. We can move right to (4, 4), and then try to find a way to move up to the goal position.

But, since we already know that (4, 4) is empty, and we can move up from there, we can try to find an alternative route. Unfortunately, there is no other empty space that allows us to move closer to the goal.

So, we will move right to (4, 4), and then try to find a way to move up to the goal position.

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that the player is at position (4, 4), we need to move closer to the goal position (4, 3). Since the goal is located above the current position, we can move up to reach it.

However, we notice that the space directly above the current position, (4, 3), is not listed as an empty space. But, we can see that there is no other empty space that allows us to move closer to the goal.

Unfortunately, it seems that we have reached a dead end. The current position (4, 4) does not allow us to move closer to the goal position (4, 3).

However, I will try to find an alternative solution. Since we cannot move up to the goal position, we can try to move to a different empty space that might allow us to find a new path to the goal.

One possible move is to move down to (4, 5), which is an empty space. From there, we can try to find a new path to the goal.

One possible move is to move up to (4, 4), which is an empty space. From there, we can try to find a new path to the goal.

The coordinates of my next move are: (4, 4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original maze, and the empty spaces form an L-shape that is recognizable as the same shape as the original maze. The path from P to G can be reached through the empty spaces.
