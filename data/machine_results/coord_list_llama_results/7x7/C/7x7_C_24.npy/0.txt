You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since we are only asked for the next move, we can analyze the maze manually.

Given the current player position (5, 3) and the goal position (1, 1), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

Looking at the maze, we can see that the player is currently at (5, 3), which is not an empty space according to the provided list of empty spaces. However, since the player is already at this position, we will assume it is a valid starting point.

The closest empty space to the player is (5, 2) or (5, 4) or (5, 5), but since we want to move towards the goal, we should move to (5, 2) or (5, 4) to get closer to the goal. However, moving to (5, 2) would put us in a position where we would have to move back to (5, 1) to continue towards the goal, so it's better to move to (5, 4) and then to (5, 5) and then to (5, 1) and continue from there.

However, there is a shorter path. We can move to (5, 1) directly and then continue towards the goal.

So, the next move would be to (5, 1) and then we can continue from there.

The answer is: (5, 1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "L-shaped" or "Elbow-shaped" path.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shaped path:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (1, 1)

This new maze has a similar L-shaped path, but with some variations in the wall and empty space configurations. The player can navigate from the starting position (5, 5) to the goal position (1, 1) through the empty spaces.
