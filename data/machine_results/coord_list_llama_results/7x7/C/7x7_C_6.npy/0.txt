You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, given the constraints of the problem and the format requested, I will describe the steps to reach the goal and provide the next move directly.

Given the maze's layout, the player's position, and the goal, we need to navigate from (6, 2) to (4, 2). The direct path is blocked by walls, so we need to find a route around them.

1. **Initial Position**: (6, 2)
2. **Goal**: (4, 2)

Looking at the maze, the most direct path to the goal involves moving up and then left, navigating around the walls. However, since we can only move to adjacent empty spaces, we need to find a path that adheres to this rule.

**Next Move**: Since we are at (6, 2) and need to move towards the goal at (4, 2), and considering the empty spaces available, the best next move is to move up to an empty space that brings us closer to the goal or allows us to navigate around the walls effectively.

Given the empty spaces provided, moving directly up from (6, 2) is not possible because (6, 1) is the only empty space above (6, 2), but it's not directly above it; it's to the left. However, we can move left to (6, 1) as it's an adjacent empty space, which is a necessary step to navigate around the walls and eventually move up and left towards the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to move left to (6, 1).

**Next Move Coordinates**: (6, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (6, 1), we need to continue navigating towards the goal at (4, 2).

Looking at the available empty spaces and the walls, the next logical move is to move up to an empty space that brings us closer to the goal or allows us to navigate around the walls effectively.

However, moving directly up from (6, 1) is not possible because there are no empty spaces above it. We need to find an alternative route.

Considering the empty spaces provided, moving left is not an option since we are already at the leftmost column of empty spaces. Moving right is also not an option since it would take us further away from the goal.

The only viable option is to move down to (6, 2) and then reassess our next move. However, since we are trying to move towards the goal, moving down might not be the most efficient move.

Upon reevaluating the maze, I notice that moving down to (6, 2) and then moving left to (5, 2) is not possible because (5, 2) is a wall. However, moving down to (6, 2) and then moving left to (5, 1) is possible.

Therefore, the next move is to move down to (6, 2).

**Next Move Coordinates**: (6, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (6, 2), we need to continue navigating towards the goal at (4, 2).

Looking at the available empty spaces and the walls, the next logical move is to move left to (5, 2). However, (5, 2) is a wall.

Since moving left is not possible, we need to find an alternative route. Moving up or down is not an option since it would take us further away from the goal.

However, we can move left to (5, 1) and then reassess our next move. This move would bring us closer to the goal and allow us to navigate around the walls.

Therefore, the next move is to move left to (5, 1).

**Next Move Coordinates**: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (5, 1), we need to continue navigating towards the goal at (4, 2).

Looking at the available empty spaces and the walls, the next logical move is to move up to (4, 1). This move would bring us closer to the goal and allow us to navigate around the walls.

Since (4, 1) is an empty space, we can move up to it.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (4, 1), we need to continue navigating towards the goal at (4, 2).

Looking at the available empty spaces and the walls, the next logical move is to move right to (4, 2). However, since (4, 2) is the goal, we can simply move right to it.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (4, 2)

Note: This move will reach the goal, so it's the final move.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original maze, includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and forms an L-shape with its empty spaces. However, it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
