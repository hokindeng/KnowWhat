You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since the maze is relatively small, BFS should be sufficient to find the shortest path to the goal.

From the player's current position (0, 0), I can move either up, down, left, or right. However, since the top and left edges of the maze are already at the boundary, I can only move down or right.

The possible next moves are:

* Down: (1, 0)
* Right: (0, 1)

Both of these moves are valid, as they are empty spaces. However, since the goal is located at (4, 3), which is more to the right, I will choose to move right.

My next move is: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 1), I can move either up, down, left, or right. However, since the top edge of the maze is already at the boundary, I can only move down or right.

The possible next moves are:

* Down: (1, 1) (but this is a wall, so it's not a valid move)
* Right: (0, 2)

Since moving down is not an option, I will choose to move right.

My next move is: (0, 2)

Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 4), I can move either up, down, left, or right. However, since the right edge of the maze is already at the boundary, I can only move up, down, or left.

The possible next moves are:

* Down: (1, 4) (but this is a wall, so it's not a valid move)
* Left: (0, 3) (but this is a previous position, so it's not a good move)
* Up is not possible since there is no empty space above

However, I notice that I can move down to (1, 0) if I move left first. So, I will move left to (0, 3) and then I will be able to move down.

But since moving left to (0, 3) is not a good move, I will try to move down to (1, 0) by moving right to the wall and then moving down. But since moving right is not possible, I will try to move down to (1, 0) by moving down to (1, 4) if it were possible, but it is not.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "L-shaped corridor".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shaped corridor shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-shaped corridor.
