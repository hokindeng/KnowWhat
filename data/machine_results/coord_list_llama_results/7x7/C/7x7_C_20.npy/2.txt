You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since the maze is relatively small, BFS should be efficient enough to find the shortest path to the goal.

First, I will analyze the maze and identify the possible moves from the current player position (0, 0). The possible moves are:

* Up: not possible (wall at (0, 1) is not a wall, but moving up would take us out of the maze)
* Down: not possible (wall at (1, 0) is not a wall, but moving down would take us into a wall)
* Left: not possible (out of the maze)
* Right: possible (empty space at (0, 1))

My next move will be to the right, to the empty space at (0, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 1), I will analyze the possible moves:

* Up: not possible (out of the maze)
* Down: not possible (wall at (1, 1))
* Left: possible (empty space at (0, 0), but this would be a step back)
* Right: possible (empty space at (0, 2))

My next move will be to the right, to the empty space at (0, 2).

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

* Down: not possible (wall at (1, 2))
* Left: possible (empty space at (0, 1), but this would be a step back)
* Right: possible (empty space at (0, 3))

My next move will be to the right, to the empty space at (0, 3).

Next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 3), I will analyze the possible moves:

* Up: not possible (out of the maze)
* Down: not possible (wall at (1, 3))
* Left: possible (empty space at (0, 2), but this would be a step back)
* Right: possible (empty space at (0, 4))

My next move will be to the right, to the empty space at (0, 4).

Next move: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 4), I will analyze the possible moves:

* Up: not possible (out of the maze)
* Down: not possible (wall at (1, 4))
* Left: possible (empty space at (0, 3), but this would be a step back)
* Right: not possible (wall at (0, 5))

Since moving right is not possible, I will consider moving down to the next row. However, there is a wall at (1, 4), so I need to find a way to move down to the next row without hitting the wall.

I notice that there is an empty space at (1, 0), which suggests that I can move down to the next row by moving left and then down. However, this would require a few steps.

A better approach would be to move down to the next row by moving to the leftmost column, where there is an empty space at (1, 0). To do this, I need to move left to the empty space at (0, 3), and then down to the empty space at (1, 3) is not possible due to the wall, but I can move down to the empty space at (1, 0).

My next move will be to the left, to the empty space at (0, 3), and then I will plan my next moves to move down to the next row.

Next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 3), I will analyze the possible moves:

* Down: not possible (wall at (1, 3))
* Left: possible (empty space at (0, 2), but this would be a step back)
* Right: not possible (wall at (0, 4) is not a wall, but moving right would take us out of the maze in the next step)

Since moving right is not possible in the long run, I will consider moving down to the next row. However, there is a wall at (1, 3), so I need to find a way to move down to the next row without hitting the wall.

I notice that there is an empty space at (1, 0), which suggests that I can move down to the next row by moving left and then down.

* Up: not possible (out of the maze)
* Down: not possible (wall at (1, 3))
* Left: possible (empty space at (0, 2))
* Right: not possible (wall at (0, 4) is not a wall, but moving right would take us out of the maze in the next step)

Since moving down is not possible, I will consider moving left or right. Moving left would take me back to a previous position, so I will choose to move down to the next row by moving left and then down.

My next move will be to the left, to the empty space at (0, 2), and then I will plan my next moves to move down to the next row.

Next move: (0, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (6, 6)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original maze, and the empty spaces form an L-shape. The path from P to G can be reached through the empty spaces, and the maze is not an identical copy of the original maze.
