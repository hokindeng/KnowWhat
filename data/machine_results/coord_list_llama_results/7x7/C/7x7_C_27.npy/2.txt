You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (3, 3) to the goal position (1, 3) while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

Given the current player position (3, 3) and the goal position (1, 3), the most direct path would be to move upwards. However, we need to ensure that each move is valid by checking if the destination is an empty space.

The first move should be to move up from (3, 3) to (2, 3), which is an empty space according to the provided information.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 3), we need to continue moving towards the goal position (1, 3).

Since the goal position is directly above the current position, the next move should be to move up from (2, 3) to (1, 3), which is the goal position.

However, we need to verify that the destination is an empty space. Unfortunately, the provided information does not explicitly list (1, 3) as an empty space. But since it's the goal position, we can assume it's a valid move.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (1, 3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Vertical Stripe" or a "Vertical Channel". The empty spaces are concentrated in a vertical column, forming a narrow path.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

This new maze has the same vertical stripe shape as the original, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The player starts at the bottom of the stripe and needs to navigate up to the goal position at the top.
