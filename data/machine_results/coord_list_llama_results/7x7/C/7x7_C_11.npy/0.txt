You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the maze is relatively small and the question asks for a step-by-step solution, we can also approach this by visually analyzing the maze and making logical moves towards the goal.

Given the maze's layout, the player's position is at (6, 3), and the goal is at (4, 0). The first step is to move towards the goal by going up and left, as moving down or right would lead us further away from the goal or into walls.

The immediate next move should be to move up from (6, 3) to (6, 2), as this is an empty space and moving left from (6, 3) would put us into a wall.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (6, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze, the next logical move is to continue moving up and left towards the goal. Since we are currently at (6, 2), the next move should be to move up to (6, 1), as this is an empty space and moving left from (6, 2) would put us into a wall.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (6, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze, the next logical move is to continue moving left towards the goal. Since we are currently at (6, 1), the next move should be to move left to (6, 0), as this is an empty space.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (6, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze, the next logical move is to move up and left towards the goal. However, since we are already at the leftmost column (x=6), we can only move up. But moving up would put us into a wall. Therefore, we need to move down to (5, 0), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (5, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (3, 4)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original maze, and the empty spaces form an L-shape that is recognizable as the same shape as the original maze. The path from P to G can be reached through the empty spaces.
