You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since the maze is relatively small, BFS should be sufficient to find the shortest path to the goal.

First, I will analyze the maze and identify the possible moves from the current player position (3, 2). The adjacent empty spaces are:

* (3, 3) is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
* (2, 2) is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
* (4, 2) is an empty space, so it's a valid move.

Since the goal is (2, 4), I will prioritize moving towards the goal. Therefore, my next move will be to (2, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will provide the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 2), I can see that the adjacent empty spaces are:

* (2, 3) is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
* (3, 2) is an empty space, but it's the previous position, so I won't move back there.

Since the goal is (2, 4), I will move towards it. My next move will be to (2, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 3), I can see that the adjacent empty spaces are:

* (2, 2) is an empty space, but it's the previous position, so I won't move back there.
* (2, 4) is not an empty space according to the current state of the maze, but it's the goal position. However, I notice that there is no wall between (2, 3) and (2, 4), so I assume it's a valid move.
* (3, 3) is a wall, so it's not a valid move.

Since the goal is (2, 4), I will move towards it. My next move will be to (2, 4).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (6, 6)

This new maze has the same size as the original and forms an L-shape with its empty spaces. The path from P to G can be reached through the empty spaces, and it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
