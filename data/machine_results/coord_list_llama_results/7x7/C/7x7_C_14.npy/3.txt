You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or maze. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and not necessarily the shortest path, we'll adapt our approach to simply find a valid path.

Given the current player position (P) at (0, 1) and the goal position (G) at (4, 3), we'll start by examining the possible moves from the current position.

### Current Position: (0, 1)

Looking at the maze, from (0, 1), we can move either up, down, left, or right. However, since (0, 0) is the only adjacent empty space that is not blocked by a wall, our first move will be to (0, 0).

### Next Move: (0, 0)

This move is chosen because it's the only available move that doesn't lead us into a wall or out of the maze boundaries. After moving to (0, 0), we'll reassess the maze for the next possible move.

However, since the problem statement asks for the next move without providing the updated maze after each move, we'll proceed with the understanding that our goal is to navigate towards the goal position (4, 3) while avoiding walls and staying within the maze.

### Approach

1. **Assess Current Position**: Always check the current position and its adjacent spaces.
2. **Choose Next Move**: Select a move that avoids walls and moves closer to the goal or keeps options open for future moves.
3. **Update and Repeat**: After each move, reassess the situation based on the updated maze.

Given the constraints and the initial setup, the first move is to (0, 0). However, to proceed further, we would typically need the updated maze after each move to accurately plan the next step. Since we're not provided with the updated maze after the first move, we'll outline a general strategy for navigating the maze:

- **Move Down**: Since moving up is blocked by a wall at (0, 0), and moving left or right is not possible without hitting a wall, moving down from (0, 1) to (1, 1) is not possible due to a wall. Thus, our initial move to (0, 0) is based on the given information.
- **Future Moves**: We would aim to move towards the goal (4, 3) by navigating through the empty spaces, avoiding walls. This might involve moving right and then down through the available paths.

### Conclusion

Given the initial setup and the need for step-by-step navigation without the updated maze after each move, the first move is to (0, 0). Further moves would be determined based on the updated maze and the goal of reaching (4, 3) while avoiding walls.

**First Move Coordinates: (0, 0)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, we're now at position (0, 0). Our goal is to move towards the goal position (4, 3) while avoiding walls.

From (0, 0), we can see that moving left is not possible since we're already at the left edge of the maze. Moving up is also not possible due to the wall at (0, 4) and beyond, but more immediately, there's no empty space above (0, 0). Moving down is not possible due to the wall at (1, 1) and beyond in that column. Therefore, our only viable move is to the right.

### Next Move: (0, 1)

This move is chosen because it's the only available move that doesn't lead us into a wall or out of the maze boundaries. After moving to (0, 1), we'll reassess the maze for the next possible move.

However, it's worth noting that (0, 1) was our starting position, and we've essentially moved back to it. This indicates that our initial move to (0, 0) might not have been the most strategic, given the constraints of the maze. Nonetheless, we proceed with the goal of reaching (4, 3).

### Future Strategy

- **Navigate Through Empty Spaces**: We'll aim to move through the empty spaces in a way that brings us closer to the goal (4, 3).
- **Avoid Walls**: We'll continue to avoid moving into walls, which will require careful planning of each move.

Given the current state of the maze and our position at (0, 0), moving to (0, 1) is the next logical step.

**Next Move Coordinates: (0, 1)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, we're now back at position (0, 1). Our goal remains to move towards the goal position (4, 3) while avoiding walls.

From (0, 1), we can see that moving left is not possible since we're already at the left edge of the maze. Moving up is not possible due to the wall at (0, 4) and beyond, but more immediately, there's no empty space above (0, 1). Moving down is not possible due to the wall at (1, 1) and beyond in that column. However, moving right is possible since there are empty spaces at (0, 2) and (0, 3).

### Next Move: (0, 2)

This move is chosen because it's the only available move that doesn't lead us into a wall or out of the maze boundaries. After moving to (0, 2), we'll reassess the maze for the next possible move.

### Future Strategy

- **Navigate Through Empty Spaces**: We'll aim to move through the empty spaces in a way that brings us closer to the goal (4, 3).
- **Avoid Walls**: We'll continue to avoid moving into walls, which will require careful planning of each move.
- **Explore Right and Down**: Since moving left and up are not viable options, we'll focus on exploring the right and down directions to find a path towards the goal.

Moving down is not possible due to the wall at (1, 3) and beyond in that column. However, moving right is not possible since there are no empty spaces to the right of (0, 3).

It seems we've reached a dead end. We need to backtrack and explore other paths.

Let's go back to the previous position (0, 2) and explore other options.

### Next Move: (0, 2)

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, we're now at position (4, 1). Our goal remains to move towards the goal position (4, 3) while avoiding walls.

From (4, 1), we can see that moving left is not possible since we're already at the left edge of the column. Moving down is not possible since we're already at the bottom of the column. However, moving up is possible since there is an empty space at (4, 2).

### Next Move: (4, 2)

This move is chosen because it's the only available move that doesn't lead us into a wall or out of the maze boundaries. After moving to (4, 2), we'll reassess the maze for the next possible move.

### Future Strategy

- **Navigate Through Empty Spaces**: We'll aim to move through the empty spaces in a way that brings us closer to the goal (4, 3).
- **Avoid Walls**: We'll continue to avoid moving into walls, which will require careful planning of each move.
- **Explore Up**: Since moving left and down are not viable options, we'll focus on exploring the up direction to find a path towards the goal.

Given the current state of the maze and our position at (4, 1), moving to (4, 2) is the next logical step.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (6, 0)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-shape.
