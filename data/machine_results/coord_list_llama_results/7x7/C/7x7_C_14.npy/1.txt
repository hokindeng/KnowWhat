You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since we are only asked for the next move and not the entire path, we can simplify the process by analyzing the maze and the player's position relative to the goal.

Given the player's current position (0, 1) and the goal position (4, 3), we need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. The direct path to the goal is blocked by walls, so we need to find an alternative route.

Looking at the maze, we can see that the player can move down from the current position (0, 1) to (1, 1), but this is blocked by a wall. The only available move from the current position is to move right to (0, 2) or down to (1, 0) is not possible due to the wall, but moving right is a viable option.

However, considering the ultimate goal of reaching (4, 3), moving right to (0, 2) does not directly contribute to reaching the goal. Instead, we should aim to move down and then right to navigate around the walls.

Given the constraints and the goal, the best next move would be to move down to (1, 1) if it were not for the wall. Since we cannot move down due to the wall, and moving right does not directly help, we need to reconsider our approach based on the available paths.

Upon reevaluation, considering the walls and the goal, the most logical step, given the constraints, would be to move right to (0, 2) as it's the only immediate move that doesn't result in hitting a wall, but this doesn't align with the optimal path towards the goal. The optimal path involves moving down and then navigating right, but due to the wall at (1, 1), we cannot proceed directly down.

Given the immediate options and the need to avoid walls while moving towards the goal, the initial analysis overlooked the direct implication of the walls on the path. The correct approach should involve moving towards the goal while avoiding the walls, which means considering the path that involves moving down and then right, but given the wall at (1, 1), the immediate move should indeed aim to utilize the available paths effectively.

However, the initial analysis aimed to simplify the decision based on direct movement towards the goal, overlooking the complexity introduced by the walls. The correct next move, considering the need to navigate around the walls and towards the goal, involves a more nuanced approach than initially suggested.

Given the constraints and upon further reflection, the initial suggestion to move right to (0, 2) was based on avoiding the immediate wall at (1, 1) but didn't fully consider the optimal path towards the goal. The optimal strategy involves navigating around the walls to reach the goal, which means the initial move should be part of a strategy that ultimately leads to moving down and then right, avoiding the walls.

Considering the need for a step-by-step solution and the constraints of the maze, the correct approach is to analyze the maze for a path that avoids walls and moves towards the goal. Given the complexity of the maze and the initial position, the first move should indeed aim to set up for navigating around the walls effectively.

However, the detailed analysis provided initially overlooked the direct path implications due to the walls and the goal's position. The correct next move, with the goal of reaching (4, 3) from (0, 1) while avoiding walls, should indeed consider the optimal path around the walls.

Given the setup, the actual viable move from (0, 1) that aligns with moving towards the goal while avoiding walls, considering the maze's layout and the goal's position, involves navigating through the available empty spaces effectively.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(0, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (0, 2), we need to navigate towards the goal at (4, 3) while avoiding walls.

Looking at the maze, we can see that moving down from the current position is blocked by walls. The only available move from the current position is to move left to (0, 1) or right to (0, 3).

Since moving left would put us back at the starting position, and we want to make progress towards the goal, the best next move would be to move right to (0, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(0, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (0, 3), we need to navigate towards the goal at (4, 3) while avoiding walls.

Looking at the maze, we can see that moving down from the current position is blocked by walls. The only available move from the current position is to move left to (0, 2) or right is not possible due to the wall at (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6).

Since moving left would put us back at a previous position, and we want to make progress towards the goal, we should consider moving down, but since it's blocked by walls, we need to find an alternative route.

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that moving down is not possible, but we can move down from a different position. We need to move to a position where we can move down without hitting a wall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 0)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (0, 6)
Goal: (4, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-shape.
