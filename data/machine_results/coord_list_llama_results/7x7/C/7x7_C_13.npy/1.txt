You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since the maze is relatively small, BFS should be efficient enough to find the shortest path to the goal.

First, I will analyze the maze and the player's current position. The player is at (3, 0), and the goal is at (6, 3). I will look for the nearest empty space that is adjacent to the player's current position.

From the given empty spaces, I notice that (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3) are all adjacent to the player's current position. However, since the goal is to the right and down, I will choose the empty space that is most likely to lead me in that direction.

My next move will be to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 0), I'll analyze the available empty spaces and plan my next move.

Since my goal is to reach (6, 3), I'll try to move down and to the right. I notice that (2, 1) is an empty space adjacent to my current position, and it's also in the direction I want to go.

My next move will be to (2, 1).

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 1), I'll analyze the available empty spaces and plan my next move.

Since my goal is to reach (6, 3), I'll try to move down and to the right. I notice that (2, 2) is an empty space adjacent to my current position, and it's also in the direction I want to go.

My next move will be to (2, 2).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 2), I'll analyze the available empty spaces and plan my next move.

Since my goal is to reach (6, 3), I'll try to move down and to the right. I notice that (2, 3) is an empty space adjacent to my current position, and it's also in the direction I want to go.

My next move will be to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (2, 3), I'll analyze the available empty spaces and plan my next move.

Since my goal is to reach (6, 3), I'll try to move down and to the right. However, I notice that the space directly below me is a wall, and the space to the right is also a wall. I need to find a way to move around these obstacles.

I notice that (3, 0) is an empty space, but it's not directly adjacent to my current position. However, I can move down to (3, 0) by moving left and then down.

My next move will be to (3, 0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (5, 3)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original maze, and the empty spaces form an L-shape that is recognizable as the same shape as the original maze. The path from P to G is also valid and can be reached through empty spaces.
