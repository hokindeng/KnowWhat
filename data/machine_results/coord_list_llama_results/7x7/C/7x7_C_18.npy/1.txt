You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a simple pathfinding approach since the maze is relatively small and straightforward. Given the player's current position (1, 0) and the goal position (3, 1), we aim to move towards the goal while avoiding walls.

First, let's analyze the maze structure based on the provided information:

- The player starts at (1, 0).
- The goal is at (3, 1).
- There are walls blocking direct paths in several areas, but there's a clear path from the start to the goal if we navigate correctly.

Given the empty spaces and the goal's position, a viable path seems to be moving down from the start position since moving directly right is blocked by walls.

My next move would be to move down from (1, 0) to (2, 0), as this space is empty and it moves us closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

So, my next move is: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (2, 0), the next step is to move towards the goal (3, 1) while avoiding walls.

Since moving directly right from (2, 0) is not possible due to the wall at (2, 1), and moving up or down would not bring us closer to the goal, we need to find an alternative path.

However, looking at the empty spaces, there's no direct path to the goal from the current position without going through a wall. But we can see that moving to (3, 0) is possible, as it's an empty space, and then we can reassess the path from there.

So, my next move is to move right from (2, 0) to (3, 0).

Please update the maze state accordingly.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (3, 0), the next step is to move towards the goal (3, 1).

Since the goal is directly to the right of the current position, and there are no walls blocking this path, we can move right to reach the goal.

So, my next move is to move right from (3, 0) to (3, 1).

This should put us at the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (6, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original and forms an L-shape with its empty spaces. The path from the player position (1, 6) to the goal (6, 3) can be reached through the empty spaces.
