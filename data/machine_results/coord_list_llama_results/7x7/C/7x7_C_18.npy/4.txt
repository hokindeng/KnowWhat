You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since the maze is relatively small, BFS should be sufficient to find the shortest path to the goal.

From the player's current position (1, 0), I will explore all possible adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are:

* Up: (0, 0)
* Down: Not possible due to wall at (2, 0)
* Left: Not possible due to wall at (1, 1)
* Right: (1, 1) is a wall, but (1, 2) is not a valid move since it's also a wall. However, I can move to (1, 3) is not possible, but (1, 2) is a wall, so I can move to (0, 1) or (0, 2) or (0, 3) from (0, 0) which is up.

My next move will be to (0, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 0), I will explore all possible adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are:

* Up: Not possible since we are already at the top row
* Down: (1, 0) is an empty space
* Left: Not possible since we are already at the leftmost column
* Right: (0, 1), (0, 2), and (0, 3) are all empty spaces

My next move will be to (0, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 1), I will explore all possible adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are:

* Up: Not possible since we are already at the top row
* Down: (1, 1) is a wall, so we cannot move down
* Left: (0, 0) is an empty space
* Right: (0, 2) and (0, 3) are both empty spaces

However, since our goal is to reach (3, 1), it would be more efficient to move down and then right. But since (1, 1) is a wall, we need to find an alternative route.

My next move will be to (0, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 3), I will explore all possible adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are:

* Up: Not possible since we are already at the top row
* Down: (1, 3) is a wall, so we cannot move down
* Left: (0, 2) is an empty space
* Right: Not possible since we are already at the rightmost column of empty spaces

However, since our goal is to reach (3, 1), it would be more efficient to move down and then right. But since (1, 3) is a wall, we need to find an alternative route.

My next move will be to (0, 2).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Note: I'm essentially backtracking to (0, 2) to explore other possible routes.

However, I notice that I can move to (2, 0) from (1, 0) which is a possible route to the goal.

My next move will be to (2, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Note: I'm essentially moving to the right and down to try to find a path to the goal.

However, I notice that I can move to (3, 0) from (2, 0) which is a possible route to the goal.

My next move will be to (3, 0).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Note: I'm essentially moving to the right to try to find a path to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 0), I will explore all possible adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are:

* Up: Not possible since we are already at the top row
* Down: Not possible since there are no empty spaces below us
* Left: Not possible since we are already at the leftmost column of empty spaces
* Right: (3, 1) is not an empty space, but it is the goal. However, I notice that (3, 2) and (3, 3) are empty spaces, but they are not directly adjacent to the goal.

However, I notice that I can move to (3, 2) or (3, 3) from (3, 0) and then try to find a path to the goal.

But wait, I can actually move to the goal (3, 1) from (3, 0) since it's the only possible move left.

My next move will be to (3, 1).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Note: I'm essentially moving to the right to try to find a path to the goal, and it looks like I've finally reached it!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (0, 6)
Goal: (6, 6)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-shape.
