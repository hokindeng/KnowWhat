You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (0, 4), we can move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent empty space. However, since the maze is surrounded by walls on the left and top sides, and the player is already at the leftmost side, the only possible move is to the right or down.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine the best next move
Looking at the maze, moving down is not possible because there are walls below the current position. Therefore, the only viable move is to the right. However, we need to check if the space to the right is empty.

## Step 4: Check if the space to the right is empty
According to the given empty spaces, (1, 4) is an empty space, which means we can move to the right.

## Step 5: Determine the coordinates of the next move
Since we are moving to the right from (0, 4), the coordinates of the next move will be (1, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has been updated to reflect the new player position at (1, 4). The goal remains at (2, 4).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (1, 4), we can move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent empty space. However, since the space to the left is a wall and we just came from there, and moving down is not possible because there are walls below the current position, the only possible moves are up or right.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine the best next move
Looking at the maze, moving up is not possible because there are walls above the current position. Therefore, the only viable move is to the right.

## Step 4: Check if the space to the right is empty
According to the given empty spaces, there is no empty space to the right at (2, 4) listed, but since the goal is at (2, 4), we can assume it is an empty space.

## Step 5: Determine the coordinates of the next move
Since we are moving to the right from (1, 4), the coordinates of the next move will be (2, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 4)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), and (3, 6). These spaces form a shape that resembles a "L" or a "bent corridor".

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a recognizable "L" or "bent corridor" shape. We will place the empty spaces in a way that creates a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L}$
