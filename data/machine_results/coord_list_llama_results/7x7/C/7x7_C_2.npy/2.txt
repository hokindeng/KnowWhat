You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (0, 4), we can move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent empty space. However, since the maze layout shows that the only possible move from (0, 4) is to the right, as moving up, down, or left would result in hitting a wall or being out of the maze boundaries.

## Step 3: Determine the next move
Since the goal is to reach (2, 4) and the only possible move from (0, 4) is to the right, we should move to the right. However, we need to check if the space to the right is empty. According to the given empty spaces, (1, 4) is an empty space, so we can move to (1, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Analyze the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (1, 4), and the goal is to reach position (2, 4). We need to examine the possible moves from the current position.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (1, 4), we can move up, down, left, or right to an adjacent empty space. However, since the maze layout shows that the only possible move from (1, 4) is to the right, as moving up, down, or left would result in hitting a wall or being out of the maze boundaries.

## Step 3: Determine the next move
Since the goal is to reach (2, 4) and the only possible move from (1, 4) is to the right, we should move to the right. However, we need to check if the space to the right is empty. According to the given empty spaces, there is no empty space at (2, 4) listed, but since it's the goal, we can assume it's a valid move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 4)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), and (3, 6). These spaces form a general shape that can be described as a "L-shape" or a "corner" shape, with the main corridor being a vertical line and a short horizontal branch.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape but different layout
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to maintain the L-shape or corner shape of the empty spaces while changing the layout. We can achieve this by rotating the shape and adjusting the positions of the empty spaces.

## Step 3: Define the new maze layout
The new maze will have the same size as the original maze. We will rotate the L-shape to form a new path. The new empty spaces will be at (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), and (5, 2). The player position will be at (2, 1), and the goal position will be at (5, 2).

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
The new maze can be encoded as follows:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (5, 2)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$
