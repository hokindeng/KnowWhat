You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since we're asked for a step-by-step solution and the maze is relatively simple, we can also approach this by visually inspecting the maze and making logical moves towards the goal.

Given the player's current position at (6, 2) and the goal at (2, 1), we need to navigate upwards and to the left, avoiding walls.

1. **Initial Position**: (6, 2)

Looking at the maze, the most direct path to the goal involves moving up and left. However, we need to navigate around the walls.

2. **First Move**: Since we can't move directly up from (6, 2) due to the wall at (5, 2), we'll move right to (6, 3) to find a path around the wall.

3. **Second Move**: From (6, 3), we can move up to (5, 3) since there's no wall blocking this path.

4. **Third Move**: Continuing upwards, we move from (5, 3) to (4, 3).

5. **Fourth Move**: Then, we move from (4, 3) to (3, 3), continuing upwards.

6. **Fifth Move**: Next, we move from (3, 3) to (2, 3), getting closer to the goal.

7. **Sixth Move**: Since we can't move directly left from (2, 3) due to the wall at (2, 2), we need to find an alternative route. However, upon closer inspection, we realize we can actually move left from (2, 3) to (2, 2) is not possible due to the wall, so we correct our approach: We should move left from (2, 3) to (2, 2) is not possible, so we move left from (3, 3) to (3, 2) is not possible due to the wall at (3, 2), so we move left from (4, 3) to (4, 2) is not possible due to the wall, so we move left from (5, 3) to (5, 2) is not possible due to the wall, so we move left from (6, 3) to (6, 2) and then up to (5, 2) is not possible due to the wall, so we move left from (6, 3) to (6, 2) and then left to (6, 1) and then up.

However, the correct sequence should directly aim to reach the goal by moving around the walls efficiently. Let's correct the approach for a direct solution:

1. **Corrected First Move**: Move from (6, 2) to (6, 1).

2. **Corrected Second Move**: Then, move up from (6, 1) to (5, 1).

3. **Corrected Third Move**: Continue moving up from (5, 1) to (4, 1).

4. **Corrected Fourth Move**: Move up from (4, 1) to (3, 1).

5. **Corrected Fifth Move**: Finally, move up from (3, 1) to (2, 1), reaching the goal.

Given the complexity of manually describing each step without visual aids and the potential for confusion in the initial explanation, the corrected approach directly moves towards the goal, avoiding walls by moving left and then up.

The first move should be to (6, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Labyrinthine Path" or more specifically, a "Meandering Channel". However, if I had to simplify it to a more common geometric shape, I would say it resembles a "Winding Rectangle" or a "Sinuous Rectangle".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 5)
Goal: (2, 1)

This new maze has a similar winding rectangular shape, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The path from the player position to the goal is still a meandering channel, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
