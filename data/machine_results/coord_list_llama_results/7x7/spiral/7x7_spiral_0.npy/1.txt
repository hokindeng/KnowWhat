You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (5, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or grid, which is the case here.

Given the player's current position is (3, 0) and the goal is (5, 3), I will start by exploring all possible moves from the current position.

The possible moves from (3, 0) are:
- Up: Not possible because it's out of the grid's bounds.
- Down: (4, 0) is an empty space.
- Left: Not possible because it's out of the grid's bounds.
- Right: (3, 1) is a wall.

Therefore, the only valid move from the current position (3, 0) is down to (4, 0).

My next move is: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (5, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 0), I will explore all possible moves.

The possible moves from (4, 0) are:
- Up: Not possible because it's out of the grid's bounds.
- Down: (5, 0) is an empty space.
- Left: Not possible because it's out of the grid's bounds.
- Right: (4, 1) is a wall.

Since moving down to (5, 0) is the only valid move, I will choose that.

My next move is: (5, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (5, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 0), I will explore all possible moves.

The possible moves from (5, 0) are:
- Up: Not possible because it's out of the grid's bounds.
- Down: Not possible because it would move out of the grid's bounds or into a wall.
- Left: Not possible because it's out of the grid's bounds.
- Right: (5, 1) is an empty space.

Since moving right to (5, 1) is the only valid move, I will choose that.

My next move is: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (5, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 1), I will explore all possible moves.

The possible moves from (5, 1) are:
- Up: Not possible because it's out of the grid's bounds.
- Down: Not possible because it would move into a wall.
- Left: Not possible because it's out of the grid's bounds.
- Right: (5, 2) is an empty space.

Since moving right to (5, 2) is the only valid move, I will choose that.

My next move is: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (5, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 2), I will explore all possible moves.

The possible moves from (5, 2) are:
- Up: Not possible because it's out of the grid's bounds.
- Down: Not possible because it would move into a wall.
- Left: Not possible because it would move into a wall.
- Right: (5, 3) is not a wall, but it's not listed as an empty space either. However, since it's the goal position, I will assume it's a valid move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Labyrinthine Path" or more specifically, a "Meandering Corridor". However, if I had to choose a more geometric shape, I would say it resembles a "Winding Rectangle" or a "Sinuous Rectangle".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (5, 3)

This new maze has a similar winding rectangular shape, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The path from the player position to the goal is still a meandering corridor, but with a distinct twist.
