You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since the maze is relatively small, BFS should be efficient enough to find the shortest path to the goal.

First, I will analyze the current situation:

* The player is at position (4, 3).
* The goal is at position (6, 5).
* The empty spaces adjacent to the player's current position are (4, 2), (4, 4), and (3, 3) is blocked by a wall, so I will ignore it.

My next move will be to position (4, 4), as it is one of the empty spaces adjacent to the current position and it seems to be a promising direction towards the goal.

My next move is: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After analyzing the current state of the maze, I notice that the player is now at position (4, 4). The empty spaces adjacent to the current position are (4, 3), (4, 5), and (3, 4) is blocked by a wall, so I will ignore it.

Since the goal is at position (6, 5), I will try to move in that general direction. My next move will be to position (4, 5), as it is one of the empty spaces adjacent to the current position and it seems to be a promising direction towards the goal.

My next move is: (4, 5)

Since the goal is at position (6, 5), I will try to move in that general direction. However, I need to move down to reach the goal. My next move will be to position (5, 5), but unfortunately, it's blocked by a wall. So, I will move to position (4, 6) and then try to find a way to move down.

My next move is: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After analyzing the current state of the maze, I notice that the player is now at position (4, 6). The empty spaces adjacent to the current position are (4, 5) and (3, 6).

Since the goal is at position (6, 5), I will try to move in that general direction. I will move down to the bottom row, and then try to move right to reach the goal. My next move will be to position (5, 6), but unfortunately, it's blocked by a wall. So, I will move to position (3, 6) and then try to find a way to move down and right.

Since the goal is at position (6, 5), I will try to move in that general direction. I will move right to the next column, and then try to move down to reach the goal. My next move will be to position (4, 6), which is already known to be empty.

Since the goal is at position (6, 5), I will try to move in that general direction. I will move right to the next column, but since (5, 5) is blocked, I will move to position (5, 4) or (5, 6) and then try to find a way to move right and up to reach the goal. However, I can also move to position (5, 1) and then try to move up and right to reach the goal, but that would be a longer path.

My next move is: (5, 4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "Meandering Path" or a "Winding Corridor".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 3)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (6, 5)

This new maze has a similar meandering path shape, but with some differences in the wall placement and the starting and goal positions.
