You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since the maze is relatively small, BFS should be efficient enough to find the shortest path to the goal.

First, I will analyze the current situation:

* The player is at position (5, 5).
* The goal is at position (3, 4).
* The empty spaces adjacent to the player's current position are (5, 4) and (4, 5).

Since the goal is to the left and up from the player's current position, I will choose to move left to (5, 4) as my next move.

My next move is: (5, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After analyzing the current state of the maze, I notice that the player is now at position (5, 4). The goal is still at position (3, 4), which means I need to move up to reach it.

The empty spaces adjacent to the player's current position are (5, 3) and (4, 4). Since moving up is the priority, I will choose to move up to (4, 4) as my next move.

My next move is: (4, 4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "Labyrinthine Channel" or a "Winding Corridor". The empty spaces form a winding path that connects the player's starting position to the goal, with several turns and narrow passages.

Here is a new maze with the same size and shape characteristics:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (3, 6)

This new maze has a similar winding corridor shape, but with a different layout and path from the player's starting position to the goal.
