You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since the maze is relatively small, BFS should be sufficient to find the shortest path to the goal.

First, I will analyze the maze and identify the possible moves from the current player position (5, 5). The possible moves are:

* Up: (5, 4)
* Down: Not possible (wall at (6, 5))
* Left: Not possible (wall at (5, 6))
* Right: Not possible (wall at (5, 6))

Since the only possible move is up, my next move will be:

(5, 4)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (5, 4), I will analyze the possible moves:

* Up: Not possible (wall at (5, 6) is not a concern, but there is no empty space above)
* Down: Not possible (wall at (6, 4))
* Left: (5, 3)
* Right: Not possible (wall at (5, 6))

Since the only possible move is left, my next move will be:

(5, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (5, 3), I will analyze the possible moves:

* Up: Not possible (wall at (5, 6) is not a concern, but there is no empty space above)
* Down: Not possible (wall at (6, 3))
* Left: Not possible (wall at (5, 2) is not a concern, but there is no empty space to the left)
* Right: (5, 4)

However, I notice that moving right would put me back in a position I've already been in. Instead, I will consider moving up to the empty space (5, 2) and then moving left to explore other paths.

My next move will be:

(5, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

* Left: Not possible (wall at (5, 0) is not a concern, but there is an empty space to the left, however, I will consider moving left to explore other paths)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (5, 0), I will analyze the possible moves:

* Up: Not possible (wall at (5, 6) is not a concern, but there is no empty space above)
* Down: Not possible (wall at (6, 0))
* Left: Not possible (wall at (4, 0) is not a concern, but there is an empty space to the left, however, I will consider moving left to explore other paths)
* Right: Not possible (wall at (5, 1) is not a concern, but I've already explored this path)

However, I notice that moving left would allow me to explore a new path. Since the wall at (4, 0) is not a concern, I will move left.

My next move will be:

(4, 0)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 0), I will analyze the possible moves:

* Up: Not possible (wall at (4, 6) is not a concern, but there is no empty space above)
* Down: Not possible (wall at (6, 0))
* Left: (3, 0)
* Right: Not possible (wall at (5, 0) is not a concern, but I've already explored this path)

Since moving left would allow me to move closer to the goal, I will move left.

My next move will be:

(3, 0)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 0), I will analyze the possible moves:

* Up: Not possible (wall at (3, 6) is not a concern, but there is no empty space above)
* Down: Not possible (wall at (6, 0))
* Left: Not possible (wall at (2, 0) is not a concern, but there is no empty space to the left)
* Right: Not possible (wall at (4, 0) is not a concern, but there is no empty space to the right)

However, I notice that I can move up to the empty space (3, 2) and then move right to explore other paths.

My next move will be:

(3, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Labyrinthine Path" or a "Winding Corridor". However, a more specific and recognizable shape can be described as a "Meandering Zigzag" or a "Wavy Channel".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar Meandering Zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Note that this new maze has a similar Meandering Zigzag shape, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The path from P to G is still winding and requires navigating through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
