You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since the maze is relatively small, BFS should be efficient enough to find the shortest path to the goal.

First, I will analyze the current state of the maze and the player's position. The player is currently at (3, 5), and the goal is at (6, 4).

From the player's current position, I can see that the only possible move is to the right, since moving up, down, or left would result in hitting a wall.

Therefore, my next move will be to (4, 5).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 5), I can see that moving down would result in hitting a wall, and moving left would take me back to the previous position. Moving up is also not possible since there is a wall at (4, 6).

However, I can move right to (5, 5), which is an empty space.

Therefore, my next move will be to (5, 5).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 5), I can see that moving right would result in hitting a wall, and moving up is also not possible since there is a wall at (5, 6).

However, I can move down to (6, 5), which is an empty space and brings me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move will be to (6, 5).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6, 5), I can see that moving left would take me back to the previous position, and moving right is not possible since there is a wall at (6, 6).

However, I can move down to (6, 4), which is the goal position.

Therefore, my next move will be to (6, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "winding path".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (6, 4)

This new maze has a similar zigzag shape, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The path from P to G is still winding and requires navigating through the empty spaces to reach the goal.
