You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since the maze is relatively small, BFS should be efficient enough to find the shortest path to the goal.

First, I will analyze the current state of the maze and the player's position. The player is currently at (3, 2), and the goal is at (4, 6).

From the player's current position, I can see that the possible moves are:

* Up: (2, 2)
* Down: (4, 2)
* Left: (3, 1) ( blocked by a wall)
* Right: (3, 3) (blocked by a wall)

Since the goal is to the right and down, I will choose to move down to (4, 2). This move is valid since (4, 2) is an empty space.

My next move is: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current state of the maze, I can see that the player is now at (4, 2). The goal is still at (4, 6), which is to the right and up.

From the player's current position, I can see that the possible moves are:

* Up: (3, 2) (back to the previous position)
* Down: (5, 2) (blocked by a wall)
* Left: (4, 1) (blocked by a wall)
* Right: (4, 3) (valid move)

Since the goal is to the right and up, I will choose to move right to (4, 3). This move is valid since (4, 3) is an empty space.

My next move is: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current state of the maze, I can see that the player is now at (4, 3). The goal is still at (4, 6), which is to the right and up.

From the player's current position, I can see that the possible moves are:

* Up: (3, 3) (blocked by a wall)
* Down: (5, 3) (blocked by a wall)
* Left: (4, 2) (back to the previous position)
* Right: (4, 4) (valid move)

Since the goal is to the right and up, I will choose to move right to (4, 4). This move is valid since (4, 4) is an empty space.

My next move is: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current state of the maze, I can see that the player is now at (4, 4). The goal is still at (4, 6), which is to the right and up.

From the player's current position, I can see that the possible moves are:

* Up: (3, 4) (blocked by a wall)
* Down: (5, 4) (blocked by a wall)
* Left: (4, 3) (back to the previous position)
* Right: (4, 5) (valid move)

Since the goal is to the right and up, I will choose to move right to (4, 5). This move is valid since (4, 5) is an empty space.

My next move is: (4, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current state of the maze, I can see that the player is now at (4, 5). The goal is still at (4, 6), which is to the right and up.

From the player's current position, I can see that the possible moves are:

* Up: (3, 5) (blocked by a wall)
* Down: (5, 5) (blocked by a wall)
* Left: (4, 4) (back to the previous position)
* Right: (4, 6) (valid move and goal position)

Since the goal is to the right, I will choose to move right to (4, 6). This move is valid since (4, 6) is the goal position.

My next move is: (4, 6)

I have reached the goal!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (6, 6)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-shape.
