You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since the maze is relatively small, BFS should be sufficient to find the shortest path to the goal.

First, I will analyze the maze and identify the possible moves from the current player position (0, 0). The possible moves are:

* Up: Not possible, as the top edge of the maze is a wall.
* Down: Possible, as the space below is empty.
* Left: Not possible, as the left edge of the maze is a wall.
* Right: Possible, as the space to the right is empty.

Since the goal is located to the right, I will choose to move right. My next move is:

(0, 1)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), I will analyze the possible moves:

* Up: Not possible, as the top edge of the maze is a wall.
* Down: Not possible, as the space below is a wall.
* Left: Possible, but it would mean moving back to the starting position, which is not desirable.
* Right: Not possible, as the space to the right is a wall.

However, I notice that the space below the wall to the right is empty. To reach that space, I need to move down and then right. But since I cannot move down from the current position, I need to find an alternative route.

I will move up to the empty space above, and then try to find a way to move down and right.

My next move is:

(0, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), I will analyze the possible moves:

* Up: Not possible, as the top edge of the maze is a wall.
* Down: Not possible, as the space below is a wall.
* Left: Possible, but it would mean moving back to the starting position, which is not desirable.
* Right: Not possible, as the space to the right is a wall.

However, I notice that the space to the right of the current position is a wall, but the space below that wall is empty. To reach that space, I need to move down and then right. But since I cannot move down from the current position, I need to find an alternative route.

I will move right is not possible, but I can move down from the space (0, 3) or (0, 4). So I will move to (0, 3) and then try to find a way to move down and right.

My next move is:

(0, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), I will analyze the possible moves:

* Up: Not possible, as the space above is already visited.
* Down: Not possible, as the space below is a wall.
* Left: Possible, but it would mean moving back to the starting position, which is not desirable.
* Right: Not possible, as the space to the right is a wall.

However, I notice that the space to the right of the current position is a wall, but the space below that wall is empty. To reach that space, I need to move down and then right. But since I cannot move down from the current position, I need to find an alternative route.

I will move to the space (0, 4) and then try to find a way to move down and right.

My next move is:

(0, 4)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 4), I will analyze the possible moves:

* Up: Possible, but it would mean moving back to the previous position.
* Down: Not possible, as the space below is a wall.
* Left: Not possible, as the space to the left is a wall.
* Right: Possible, and it would bring me closer to the goal.

Since the goal is located to the right, I will choose to move right. My next move is:

(1, 4)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form an L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (6, 6)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original maze, and the empty spaces form an L-shape that is recognizable as such. The path from P to G can be reached through the empty spaces, and the maze is not an identical copy of the original.
