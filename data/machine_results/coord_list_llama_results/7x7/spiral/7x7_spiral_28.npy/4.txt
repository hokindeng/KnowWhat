You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since I'm given the maze's layout, walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal, I can determine the next move by analyzing the possible paths from the player's current position.

Given the player's current position is (1, 6) and the goal is (4, 2), I will analyze the possible moves:

- Up: Not possible since there's a wall at (1, 5) and moving up from (1, 6) would put me out of the maze's bounds.
- Down: Not possible since there's a wall at (2, 6) and moving down from (1, 6) would put me into a wall.
- Left: Not possible since there's a wall at (0, 6) and moving left from (1, 6) would put me into a wall.
- Right: Possible, as there's an empty space at (2, 6).

Therefore, my next move would be to the right, to the coordinates (2, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the player's current position (2, 6):

- Up: Not possible since there's a wall at (2, 5) and moving up from (2, 6) would put me into a wall.
- Down: Not possible since there's a wall at (3, 6) and moving down from (2, 6) would put me into a wall.
- Left: Possible, as there's an empty space at (1, 6).
- Right: Possible, as there's an empty space at (3, 6).

Since moving left would put me back to the previous position, I will choose to move right to the coordinates (3, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the player's current position (3, 6):

- Up: Not possible since there's a wall at (3, 5) and moving up from (3, 6) would put me into a wall.
- Down: Not possible since there's no empty space below (3, 6).
- Left: Possible, as there's an empty space at (2, 6).
- Right: Possible, as there's an empty space at (4, 6).

Since moving left would put me back to the previous position, I will choose to move right to the coordinates (4, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the player's current position (4, 6):

- Up: Not possible since there's no empty space above (4, 6).
- Down: Not possible since there's a wall at (5, 6) and moving down from (4, 6) would put me into a wall.
- Left: Not possible since there's no empty space to the left of (4, 6).
- Right: Not possible since there's no empty space to the right of (4, 6).
- Down is not possible, but moving down is not the only option to move towards the goal. Since the goal is at (4, 2), I can move up to reach it. However, since moving up is not possible from (4, 6), I will move down to the next available empty space, which is not possible, but I can move up from a lower empty space. So I will move down to the next available empty space, which is (4, 5).

Therefore, my next move would be to the coordinates (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the player's current position (4, 5):

- Up: Not possible since there's no empty space above (4, 5).
- Down: Not possible since there's no empty space below (4, 5).
- Left: Not possible since there's no empty space to the left of (4, 5).
- Right: Not possible since there's no empty space to the right of (4, 5).
- Since the goal is at (4, 2), I can move down to reach it. I will move down to the next available empty space, which is (4, 4).

Therefore, my next move would be to the coordinates (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the player's current position (4, 4):

- Up: Not possible since there's no empty space above (4, 4).
- Down: Possible, as there's an empty space at (4, 3).
- Left: Not possible since there's no empty space to the left of (4, 4).
- Right: Not possible since there's no empty space to the right of (4, 4).

Since the goal is at (4, 2), I will move down to the next available empty space, which is (4, 3).

Therefore, my next move would be to the coordinates (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze, I will analyze the possible moves from the player's current position (4, 3):

- Up: Not possible since there's a wall at (4, 2) is the goal, but I can move up to reach it.
- Down: Not possible since there's no empty space below (4, 3).
- Left: Not possible since there's no empty space to the left of (4, 3).
- Right: Not possible since there's no empty space to the right of (4, 3).

Since the goal is at (4, 2), I will move up to reach it.

Therefore, my next move would be to the coordinates (4, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shaped" or "Elbow-shaped" path.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (6, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an "L-shaped" or "Elbow-shaped" path.
