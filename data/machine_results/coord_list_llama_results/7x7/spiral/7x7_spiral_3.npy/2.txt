You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since I'm given the initial state of the maze, I'll start by analyzing the possible moves from the current player position (5, 5).

From the given maze, I can see that the player is currently at position (5, 5), and the goal is at position (6, 1). Since the player can only move to adjacent empty spaces, I'll examine the possible moves:

* Up: (4, 5) is an empty space, so this is a valid move.
* Down: (6, 5) is an empty space, so this is a valid move.
* Left: (5, 4) is a wall, so this is not a valid move.
* Right: (5, 6) is a wall, so this is not a valid move.

Considering the goal position (6, 1), I'll choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, moving down to (6, 5) seems like a good choice, as it gets me closer to the goal's row.

My next move is: (6, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (6, 5)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the possible moves from the current player position (6, 5).

From the given maze, I can see that the player is currently at position (6, 5), and the goal is at position (6, 1). Since the player can only move to adjacent empty spaces, I'll examine the possible moves:

* Up: Not possible, as there is no empty space above (6, 5).
* Down: Not possible, as (6, 6) is a wall.
* Left: (6, 4) is an empty space, so this is a valid move.
* Right: Not possible, as there is no empty space to the right of (6, 5).

Considering the goal position (6, 1), I'll choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, moving left to (6, 4) seems like a good choice, as it gets me closer to the goal's column.

My next move is: (6, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the possible moves from the current player position (6, 4).

From the given maze, I can see that the player is currently at position (6, 4), and the goal is at position (6, 1). Since the player can only move to adjacent empty spaces, I'll examine the possible moves:

* Up: Not possible, as there is no empty space above (6, 4).
* Down: Not possible, as (6, 6) is a wall.
* Left: (6, 3) is an empty space, so this is a valid move.
* Right: (6, 5) is an empty space, but moving right would take me away from the goal.

Considering the goal position (6, 1), I'll choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, moving left to (6, 3) seems like a good choice, as it gets me closer to the goal's column.

My next move is: (6, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the possible moves from the current player position (6, 3).

From the given maze, I can see that the player is currently at position (6, 3), and the goal is at position (6, 1). Since the player can only move to adjacent empty spaces, I'll examine the possible moves:

* Up: Not possible, as there is no empty space above (6, 3).
* Down: Not possible, as (6, 6) is a wall.
* Left: (6, 2) is an empty space, so this is a valid move.
* Right: (6, 4) is an empty space, but moving right would take me away from the goal.

Considering the goal position (6, 1), I'll choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. In this case, moving left to (6, 2) seems like a good choice, as it gets me closer to the goal's column.

My next move is: (6, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll analyze the possible moves from the current player position (6, 2).

From the given maze, I can see that the player is currently at position (6, 2), and the goal is at position (6, 1). Since the player can only move to adjacent empty spaces, I'll examine the possible moves:

* Up: Not possible, as there is no empty space above (6, 2).
* Down: Not possible, as (6, 6) is a wall.
* Left: (6, 1) is not an empty space, but it's actually the goal position. However, I can see that (6, 0) is an empty space, and moving left would bring me closer to the goal.
* Right: (6, 3) is an empty space, but moving right would take me away from the goal.

Considering the goal position (6, 1), I'll choose the move that brings me closest to the goal. In this case, moving left to (6, 1) is not possible, but moving left to (6, 0) and then trying to find a way to (6, 1) might be a good strategy.

My next move is: (6, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Labyrinthine Path" or a "Winding Corridor". However, a more specific and recognizable shape can be identified as a "Meandering Zigzag" or a "Wavy Channel".

(2) Here is a new maze with empty spaces that form a similar Meandering Zigzag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 5)

This new maze has a similar Meandering Zigzag shape, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The path from the player position to the goal is still winding and requires navigating through the empty spaces.
