You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. This algorithm is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or grid, which is the case here.

Given the player's current position is (0, 1) and the goal is (5, 5), I will start by exploring all possible moves from the current position.

The possible moves from (0, 1) are:
- Up: (0, 0) - This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Down: (0, 2) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
- Left: Not applicable since we are at the left edge.
- Right: (1, 1) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.

Given these options, my next move will be to move down to (0, 2) because moving right would immediately put us against a wall, limiting our options, whereas moving down keeps more paths open for further exploration.

Therefore, my next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), I will explore the possible moves:

- Up: (0, 1) - This is an empty space, but it's the previous position, so it's not a good choice.
- Down: (0, 3) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
- Left: Not applicable since we are at the left edge.
- Right: (1, 2) - This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.

Given these options, my next move will be to move down to (0, 3) because it's the only valid move that allows us to progress.

Therefore, my next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), I will explore the possible moves:

- Up: (0, 2) - This is an empty space, but it's the previous position, so it's not a good choice.
- Down: (0, 4) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
- Left: Not applicable since we are at the left edge.
- Right: (1, 3) - This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.

Given these options, my next move will be to move down to (0, 4) because it's the only valid move that allows us to progress.

Therefore, my next move is to (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 4), I will explore the possible moves:

- Up: (0, 3) - This is an empty space, but it's the previous position, so it's not a good choice.
- Down: (0, 5) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
- Left: Not applicable since we are at the left edge.
- Right: (1, 4) - This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.

Given these options, my next move will be to move down to (0, 5) because it's the only valid move that allows us to progress.

Therefore, my next move is to (0, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 5), I will explore the possible moves:

- Up: (0, 4) - This is an empty space, but it's the previous position, so it's not a good choice.
- Down: (0, 6) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
- Left: Not applicable since we are at the left edge.
- Right: (1, 5) - This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.

Given these options, my next move will be to move down to (0, 6) because it's the only valid move that allows us to progress.

However, I notice that moving down will put us at the bottom edge of the maze, and we still need to move right to reach the goal. Therefore, I will reconsider my options.

Since we can't move right from the current position, I will move down to (0, 6) and then try to find a way to move right from there.

Therefore, my next move is to (0, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- Left: Not applicable since we are at the left edge.
- Right: (1, 6) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.

Given these options, my next move will be to move right to (1, 6) because it's the only valid move that allows us to progress.

Therefore, my next move is to (1, 6).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Labyrinthine Path" or a "Winding Corridor". However, a more specific and recognizable shape can be described as a "Meandering Zig-Zag" or a "Wavy Zig-Zag" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar Meandering Zig-Zag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Note that this new maze has a similar Meandering Zig-Zag shape, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The path from P to G is still winding and requires navigating through the empty spaces to reach the goal.
