You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since we are only asked for the next move and not the entire path, we can simplify the process by analyzing the maze manually for the first step.

Given the player's current position (5, 0) and the goal (2, 0), we need to move towards the goal. The direct path to the goal is blocked by walls, so we need to find an alternative route.

Looking at the maze, the player can move up, down, left, or right. Since the goal is above the player's current position, we should try to move upwards. However, the player's current position is at the bottom of the maze, and moving up is not possible from (5, 0).

The next best option is to move right, but since the wall at (5, 1) blocks the direct path to the right, we need to find another way. Moving left is not an option since it would take us further away from the goal.

Upon closer inspection, we can see that moving down is not possible, and moving up is not possible from the current position. However, we can move right from the adjacent empty space (5, 4) if we can reach it.

To reach (5, 4), we need to move right from (5, 0), but since (5, 1) is a wall, we cannot move directly to (5, 4). We need to find an alternative route.

One possible route is to move down to (6, 0), then move right to (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), and finally (6, 4). From (6, 4), we can move up to (5, 4).

However, this route is not the most efficient. A better option is to move down to (6, 0), then move right to (6, 1), (6, 2), and then move up to (5, 2) or (5, 3) if possible, and then move left to (5, 1) is not possible due to the wall, so we move up to (4, 2) or (4, 3) if possible and then move left.

But since we are only asked for the next move, we can simplify the process. The most straightforward next move would be to move down to (6, 0), as it is the only available move that does not take us further away from the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(6, 0)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we are at position (6, 0), we can see that moving up is not possible, and moving down is not an option since we would be moving away from the goal.

Looking at the maze, we can see that moving right is possible, and we can move to (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), or (6, 4). However, moving right would not bring us closer to the goal.

A better option is to move up from the adjacent empty space (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), or (6, 4) if possible. We can move right to (6, 1), and then try to move up.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(6, 1)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Empty: (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (2, 6)

This new maze has the same size as the original and forms a recognizable L-shape or bent corridor with its empty spaces. The path from P to G can be reached through the empty spaces.
