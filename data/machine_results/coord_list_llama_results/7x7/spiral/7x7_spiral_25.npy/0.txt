You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since we are only asked for the next move and not the entire path, we can simplify the process by examining the immediate neighbors of the current player position.

Given the player's current position is (5, 4) and the goal is (0, 4), we aim to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and staying on empty spaces.

The current position (5, 4) is an empty space. Let's examine the possible moves:

- Up: (5, 3) is an empty space.
- Down: (5, 5) is an empty space.
- Left: (4, 4) is a wall.
- Right: This direction would move us further away from the goal.

Since our goal is to the left and up, moving up to (5, 3) is the most direct move towards the goal without hitting a wall. This move also keeps us on an empty space.

Therefore, the next move should be to (5, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current position (5, 3) and the goal (0, 4), we need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and staying on empty spaces.

Let's examine the possible moves:

- Up: (5, 2) is an empty space.
- Down: (5, 4) is an empty space, but moving down would not bring us closer to the goal.
- Left: (4, 3) is a wall.
- Right: This direction would move us further away from the goal.

Since our goal is to the left and slightly up, moving up to (5, 2) is the most direct move towards the goal without hitting a wall. This move also keeps us on an empty space.

Therefore, the next move should be to (5, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current position (5, 2) and the goal (0, 4), we need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and staying on empty spaces.

Let's examine the possible moves:

- Up: (5, 1) is an empty space.
- Down: (5, 3) is an empty space, but moving down would not bring us closer to the goal.
- Left: (4, 2) is a wall.
- Right: This direction would move us further away from the goal.

Since our goal is to the left and slightly up, moving up to (5, 1) is the most direct move towards the goal without hitting a wall. This move also keeps us on an empty space.

Therefore, the next move should be to (5, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current position (5, 1) and the goal (0, 4), we need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and staying on empty spaces.

Let's examine the possible moves:

- Up: (5, 0) is an empty space.
- Down: (5, 2) is an empty space, but moving down would not bring us closer to the goal.
- Left: (4, 1) is a wall.
- Right: This direction would move us further away from the goal.

Since our goal is to the left and slightly up, moving up to (5, 0) is the most direct move towards the goal without hitting a wall. This move also keeps us on an empty space.

Therefore, the next move should be to (5, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current position (5, 0) and the goal (0, 4), we need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and staying on empty spaces.

Let's examine the possible moves:

- Up: This direction would move us further away from the goal.
- Down: (4, 0) is an empty space.
- Left: This direction would move us further away from the goal.
- Right: This direction would move us further away from the goal.

Since our goal is to the left and slightly up, moving down to (4, 0) is the most direct move towards the goal without hitting a wall. This move also keeps us on an empty space.

Therefore, the next move should be to (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current position (4, 0) and the goal (0, 4), we need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and staying on empty spaces.

Let's examine the possible moves:

- Up: This direction would move us further away from the goal.
- Down: This direction would move us further away from the goal.
- Left: (3, 0) is an empty space.
- Right: This direction would move us further away from the goal.

Since our goal is to the left, moving left to (3, 0) is the most direct move towards the goal without hitting a wall. This move also keeps us on an empty space.

Therefore, the next move should be to (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current position (3, 0) and the goal (0, 4), we need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and staying on empty spaces.

Let's examine the possible moves:

- Up: This direction would move us further away from the goal.
- Down: This direction would move us further away from the goal.
- Left: (2, 0) is an empty space.
- Right: This direction would move us further away from the goal.

Since our goal is to the left, moving left to (2, 0) is the most direct move towards the goal without hitting a wall. This move also keeps us on an empty space.

Therefore, the next move should be to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current position (2, 0) and the goal (0, 4), we need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and staying on empty spaces.

Let's examine the possible moves:

- Up: This direction would move us further away from the goal.
- Down: This direction would move us further away from the goal.
- Left: (1, 0) is a wall.
- Right: This direction would move us further away from the goal.

However, we can move up to (2, 1) which is an empty space, and then try to move left from there.

Therefore, the next move should be to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current position (2, 1) and the goal (0, 4), we need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and staying on empty spaces.

Let's examine the possible moves:

- Up: (2, 2) is an empty space.
- Down: (2, 0) is an empty space, but moving down would not bring us closer to the goal.
- Left: (1, 1) is a wall.
- Right: This direction would move us further away from the goal.

Since our goal is to the left and slightly up, moving up to (2, 2) is the most direct move towards the goal without hitting a wall. This move also keeps us on an empty space.

Therefore, the next move should be to (2, 2).

Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current position (2, 2) and the goal (0, 4), we need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and staying on empty spaces.

Let's examine the possible moves:

- Up: (2, 3) is an empty space.
- Down: (2, 1) is an empty space, but moving down would not bring us closer to the goal.
- Left: (1, 2) is a wall.
- Right: This direction would move us further away from the goal.

Since our goal is to the left and slightly up, moving up to (2, 3) is the most direct move towards the goal without hitting a wall. This move also keeps us on an empty space.

Therefore, the next move should be to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current position (2, 3) and the goal (0, 4), we need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and staying on empty spaces.

Let's examine the possible moves:

- Up: (2, 4) is a wall.
- Down: (2, 2) is an empty space, but moving down would not bring us closer to the goal.
- Left: (1, 3) is a wall.
- Right: This direction would move us further away from the goal.

However, we can move up to (2, 5) which is an empty space, and then try to move left from there.

Therefore, the next move should be to (2, 5).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Labyrinthine Path" or a "Winding Corridor". However, a more specific and recognizable shape can be described as a "Meandering Zig-Zag" or a "Wavy Channel".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar Meandering Zig-Zag shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (0, 4)

Note that this new maze has a similar Meandering Zig-Zag shape, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The path from P to G is still valid and can be reached through empty spaces.
