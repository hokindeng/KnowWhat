You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or maze. However, since we're asked for a step-by-step solution and not necessarily the shortest path, we'll adapt our approach to simply find a valid path by exploring the maze level by level, starting from the player's position.

Given the player's position is (4, 2) and the goal is (4, 0), we'll aim to move downwards since the goal is directly above the player.

1. **Current Position**: (4, 2)
2. **Goal**: (4, 0)

Since we can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals), and our goal is directly above us, our first move should be to move up.

**Next Move**: (4, 1)

This move is valid because (4, 1) is not listed as a wall and is adjacent to our current position. After making this move, we'll reassess the maze from the new position to determine the next step.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Path:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "L-shape" or more specifically, a "Hook" shape, with the path bending around the walls to connect the player's starting position to the goal.

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7), with empty spaces that form a similar "Hook" or "L-shape" path. The player's position (P) and the goal (G) are also included.

**Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)

**Empty:** (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)

**Player Position:** (4, 6)
**Goal:** (4, 2)

This new maze maintains the same "Hook" or "L-shape" path as the original, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The player must navigate from the starting position (4, 6) to the goal (4, 2) through the empty spaces, avoiding the walls.
