You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and given the constraints of the format, I'll describe the approach and provide the first move directly.

Given the player's position at (4, 2) and the goal at (4, 0), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal. The BFS algorithm explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, making it suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like our maze.

However, since we're constrained to provide a single move and the maze's complexity, let's analyze the situation:

1. **Current Position**: (4, 2)
2. **Goal**: (4, 0)
3. **Empty Spaces**: We have a clear path downwards from (4, 2) to (4, 0) but it's blocked by walls at (4, 1) and (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6). The direct path down is not possible due to the wall at (4, 1).

Given the constraints and the need to move around the walls, the first logical step is to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. Since moving directly down is blocked by a wall at (4, 1), we need to find an alternative route. However, given the constraints of the maze and the goal's position, we should aim to move closer to the goal while navigating around the walls.

Considering the empty spaces and the goal's position, a viable first move would be to move towards the goal, trying to find a path around the walls. However, since we cannot move directly down due to the wall at (4, 1), and considering the empty spaces provided, we should look for a path that allows us to navigate around the obstacles.

Given the direct path is blocked and without a clear alternative path from the provided empty spaces that directly leads to the goal without hitting a wall, the problem as stated doesn't provide a straightforward path using the given empty spaces and walls. The goal seems to be directly above the player, but the wall at (4, 1) blocks this path.

However, since we need to provide a move and considering the constraints, a logical approach would be to try and navigate around the walls to find a path to the goal. Given the empty spaces and the goal's proximity, if we were to move directly towards the goal without hitting a wall, we would aim for a position that gets us closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

Given the constraints and aiming to move closer to the goal while avoiding walls, and considering the format requires a specific answer:

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 1)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "L-shape" or more specifically, a "Hook" shape, with a main vertical path and a shorter horizontal path connecting at a right angle.

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here's a new maze with the same size (7x7) and a path that forms a recognizable "Hook" or "L-shape". The empty spaces are designed to create a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G) while maintaining the same general shape as the original maze.

**Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)

**Empty Spaces:** (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)

**Player Position:** (5, 6)
**Goal:** (2, 6)

This new maze maintains the "Hook" or "L-shape" formed by the empty spaces, providing a valid path from the player position to the goal while adhering to the same size and constraints as the original maze.
