You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we need to navigate from the player position (4,3) to the goal position (5,0) while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces. Given the constraints and the layout of the maze, we'll aim to move in a way that brings us closer to the goal while ensuring we don't get blocked by walls.

Looking at the maze, the most direct path to the goal from the player's current position involves moving down and then left. However, we need to navigate through the available empty spaces efficiently.

Given the empty spaces and the goal, a reasonable first move would be to move from (4,3) to (5,3), as it brings us closer to the goal and keeps us on a path that can potentially lead us to the goal without immediately hitting a wall.

Therefore, my next move would be to (5,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the player's current position at (5,3), the next move should aim to bring the player closer to the goal at (5,0) while navigating through the available empty spaces.

Since the goal is directly above the player's current position, and there are empty spaces at (5,2) and (5,1) that can serve as a path, the most logical next move would be to move up to (5,2).

This move keeps the player on a direct path towards the goal and avoids any walls.

Therefore, my next move would be to (5,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 3)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the player's current position at (5,2), the next move should aim to bring the player closer to the goal at (5,0) while navigating through the available empty spaces.

Since the goal is directly above the player's current position, and there is an empty space at (5,1) that can serve as a path, the most logical next move would be to move up to (5,1).

This move keeps the player on a direct path towards the goal and avoids any walls.

Therefore, my next move would be to (5,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the player's current position at (5,1), the next move should aim to bring the player closer to the goal at (5,0) while navigating through the available empty spaces.

Since the goal is directly above the player's current position, and there are no walls or obstacles in the way, the most logical next move would be to move up to (5,0).

This move would put the player directly at the goal position.

Therefore, my next move would be to (5,0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (6, 6)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-shape, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
