You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or maze. However, given the constraints of the problem and the need to provide a step-by-step solution, we'll adapt this approach to manually navigate through the maze.

First, let's visualize the maze based on the given information:

- Walls are represented by their coordinates.
- Empty spaces (path) are also represented by their coordinates.
- The player's current position is (4, 3).
- The goal position is (5, 0).

Given the player's current position (4, 3) and the goal (5, 0), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal while avoiding walls.

**Initial Step:**
From the current position (4, 3), we look for adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or diagonals. However, we prioritize moves that bring us closer to the goal (5, 0) without hitting a wall.

**Next Move:**
Given the constraints and the goal's position, moving down is not an option since it would take us further away from the goal. Moving left or right without going up would also not be efficient. Therefore, the best initial move is to go up and then navigate towards the goal.

The empty spaces near the current position are (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), and (5, 3). Since we are at (4, 3), moving to (4, 1) is a viable option as it brings us closer to the goal's y-coordinate (0) and keeps us on a path towards the goal's x-coordinate (5).

**Next Move Coordinates:**
(4, 1)

This move is chosen because it moves us closer to the goal's y-coordinate and keeps us on a path that can potentially lead to the goal without immediately hitting a wall. From (4, 1), we can reassess the maze and plan the next move based on the updated position and the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Original Maze's Empty Spaces:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze can be described as a "Hook" or a "J-Shaped" path. This shape is characterized by a vertical segment connected to a horizontal segment, resembling a hook or the letter "J".

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze with the same size (7x7) and a path that forms a similar "Hook" or "J-Shaped" shape. The new maze is not an identical copy of the original and includes a valid path from P to G.

**Walls:**
(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

**Empty Spaces (Path):**
(2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1)

**Player Position:**
(4, 3)

**Goal:**
(5, 0)

This new maze maintains the "Hook" or "J-Shaped" path characteristic while providing a distinct layout and a valid path from the player's position to the goal.
