You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (4, 3) to the goal position (5, 0) while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces. Given the constraints and the layout of the maze, we'll aim to move in a way that brings us closer to the goal while ensuring we don't get blocked by walls.

First, let's analyze the maze and the possible moves from the current position (4, 3):

- Moving up is not possible because (3, 3) is the only available space above, but it's not directly above (4, 3), and moving diagonally up-left or up-right would put us into a wall.
- Moving down is not possible because (5, 3) is not listed as an empty space.
- Moving left is not possible because (4, 2) is a wall.
- Moving right is not possible because (5, 3) is not an empty space.
- However, moving diagonally down-left to (3, 2) is not possible because it's not directly diagonal from (4, 3), but moving diagonally down-right is not an option since (5, 3) is not an empty space. Yet, moving diagonally up-right to (3, 4) is not possible because (3, 4) is a wall.

Given the constraints, the most viable move seems to be moving up to (3, 3), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal by reducing the vertical distance. However, since direct vertical movement to (3, 3) isn't possible due to the wall at (3, 4) not being directly relevant but indicating a need to navigate around, we should reconsider our approach based on the actual available paths.

Upon reevaluation, considering the direct movements and the goal's position, moving diagonally or directly to a position that brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls is crucial. Given the layout, moving to (4, 1) seems like a viable step as it moves us closer to the goal's x-coordinate and is an empty space, but it doesn't directly contribute to reaching the goal's y-coordinate. However, it's a necessary step to navigate around the walls and find a path downwards.

Therefore, my next move would be to (4, 1), as it's an empty space and moves us closer to the goal's x-coordinate, setting us up for further navigation downwards.

The coordinates of my next move are (4, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze appears to be a "L-shape" or more specifically, a "bent corridor" or "elbow shape", but if I had to choose a more geometric term, I'd say it resembles a "hook shape" or a "J-shape" with some irregularities. However, for simplicity, let's generalize it to a "L-shape" or a "hook shape".

(2) Here's a new maze with the same size (7x7) and a path that forms a recognizable "L-shape" or "hook shape":

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (5, 6)

This new maze maintains the same size and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, forming a recognizable "L-shape" or "hook shape".
