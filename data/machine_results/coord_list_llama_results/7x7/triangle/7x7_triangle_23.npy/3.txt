You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, given the constraints of the problem and the format requested, I'll describe the approach and provide the next move directly.

1. **Understanding the Maze**: The maze is a 7x7 grid with the player starting at (4,3) and the goal at (5,0). The walls and empty spaces are given.

2. **BFS Approach**: BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or grid, which is the case here. We explore all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

3. **Next Move**: Given the player's position at (4,3) and the goal at (5,0), we need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. The direct path to the goal is blocked by walls, so we need to navigate around them.

4. **Possible Moves**: From (4,3), possible moves are up, down, left, right, and diagonals. However, we should prioritize moves that bring us closer to the goal (5,0) without hitting a wall.

5. **Choosing the Next Move**: Since moving directly up or left is blocked by walls, and moving right or down would take us further from the goal, the best move is to go diagonally up-left or simply up if possible. However, given the wall positions, moving diagonally up-left from (4,3) is not possible due to the wall at (3,2) being absent but (3,3) and (4,2) are empty, suggesting a path up could be viable if we adjust our position.

6. **Next Move Coordinates**: Considering the constraints and aiming to move closer to the goal while navigating around walls, a reasonable next move would be to position ourselves to move up effectively. Thus, moving to (4,2) seems like a strategic move as it sets us up for further movement towards the goal without immediately hitting a wall.

Therefore, the next move would be to (4,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Original Maze's Empty Spaces:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "Hook" or more specifically, an "L-shape with a diagonal extension". This is because the empty spaces form a path that resembles an L-shape with an additional diagonal segment connecting to the goal.

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces that form a similar "L-shape with a diagonal extension" shape:

**Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

**Empty Spaces:** (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 3)

**Player Position:** (4, 3)

**Goal:** (5, 0)

This new maze has a similar "L-shape with a diagonal extension" shape formed by the empty spaces, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The player can navigate from the starting position to the goal through the empty spaces.
