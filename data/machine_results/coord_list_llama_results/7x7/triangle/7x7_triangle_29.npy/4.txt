You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and movement rules
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The player can move to any adjacent empty space, including diagonals.

## Step 2: Identify the current player position and goal position
The current player position is (1, 3) and the goal position is (1, 5).

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves from the current player position
From the current player position (1, 3), the possible moves are up, down, left, right, and diagonals. However, we need to avoid walls and move only through empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Since the goal position is (1, 5), which is two spaces to the right of the current player position, the best next move would be to move right to the empty space (1, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The player has moved to position (1, 4) and the goal is still at position (1, 5).

## Step 2: Analyze the possible moves from the current player position
From the current player position (1, 4), the possible moves are up, down, left, right, and diagonals. However, we need to avoid walls and move only through empty spaces.

## Step 3: Determine the best next move
Since the goal position is (1, 5), which is one space to the right of the current player position, the best next move would be to move right to the goal position (1, 5).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 5)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a diagonal line with a small branch or a "hook" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will place the empty spaces in a similar diagonal line with a small branch or hook shape. We will also ensure that the new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Encode the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 5)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Hook}$
