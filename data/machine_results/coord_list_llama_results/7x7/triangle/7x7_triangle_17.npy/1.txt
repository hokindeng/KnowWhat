You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. This algorithm is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which is essentially what this maze represents.

First, I will analyze the current state of the maze and the player's position (1, 4). The goal is to reach the position (4, 2).

Given the player's current position and the layout of the maze, my next move will be to move down to the position (2, 4) is not possible because (2, 4) is a wall, so I will move to the position (1, 5) which is an empty space.

Therefore, my next move will be to (1, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 5), I will analyze the possible moves. Since I can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonals), I will look for the most promising move.

Moving down to (2, 5) is a possible move, as (2, 5) is an empty space. This move seems to be a good choice, as it brings me closer to the goal position (4, 2) and keeps me on a path that could potentially lead to the goal.

Therefore, my next move will be to (2, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 5), I will analyze the possible moves. Since I can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonals), I will look for the most promising move.

Moving down to (3, 5) is a possible move, as (3, 5) is an empty space. This move seems to be a good choice, as it brings me closer to the goal position (4, 2) and keeps me on a path that could potentially lead to the goal.

Alternatively, I could also move to (2, 3), which is also an empty space and is closer to the goal position. However, moving to (2, 3) would require me to move left, which might not be the most direct path to the goal.

Considering the options, I think moving to (3, 5) is a safer choice, as it keeps me on a more direct path to the goal.

Therefore, my next move will be to (3, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Moving down to (4, 5) is a possible move, as (4, 5) is an empty space. This move seems to be a good choice, as it brings me closer to the goal position (4, 2).

Alternatively, I could also move to (3, 2), which is also an empty space and is closer to the goal position. However, moving to (3, 2) would require me to move left and down, which might not be the most direct path to the goal.

Considering the options, I think moving to (4, 5) is a safer choice, as it keeps me on a more direct path to the goal.

Therefore, my next move will be to (4, 5).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 5), I will analyze the possible moves. Since I can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonals), I will look for the most promising move.

Moving left to (4, 4) is a possible move, as (4, 4) is an empty space. This move seems to be a good choice, as it brings me closer to the goal position (4, 2).

Alternatively, I could also move down to (4, 3), which is also an empty space and is even closer to the goal position. However, moving to (4, 3) would require me to move down, which might not be the most direct path to the goal.

Considering the options, I think moving to (4, 3) is a better choice, as it brings me closer to the goal position.

Therefore, my next move will be to (4, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or "staircase" shape, but more specifically, it resembles a "L-shape" with a diagonal extension.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (4, 2)

This new maze has a similar L-shape with a diagonal extension, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The path from P to G is still valid and can be reached through the empty spaces.
