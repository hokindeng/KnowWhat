You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move closer to the goal position (4, 2) from the current player position (1, 4).

First, let's analyze the maze and the goal:

- The goal is at (4, 2).
- The current position is at (1, 4).

Given the empty spaces and the goal, a direct path is not immediately visible due to the walls. However, we can see that moving down and right would generally bring us closer to the goal.

Looking at the empty spaces:
- Directly below the player at (1, 4) is a wall, so moving straight down is not an option.
- The closest empty space that moves us towards the goal would be to the right and slightly down, but since we can move diagonally, we can aim for a space that brings us closer to the goal.

A possible next move, considering diagonal movement, would be to aim for the empty space at (2, 3), as it moves us both to the right and down, closer to the goal position (4, 2).

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (2, 3), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces and the walls, a direct path to the goal is still not immediately visible. However, we can see that moving right and slightly down would bring us closer to the goal.

Considering the available empty spaces, a possible next move would be to (3, 2), as it moves us to the right and slightly down, closer to the goal position (4, 2).

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (3, 2), we are now very close to the goal at (4, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces and the walls, we can see that the goal is directly to the right of our current position.

Therefore, my next move would be to (4, 2), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "winding path" with a mix of horizontal and vertical segments, but if I had to give it a more specific name, I would say it resembles a "staircase" or a "stair-step" shape, with the path moving in a series of right-angled turns.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape characteristics:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 2)

This new maze has a similar staircase-like shape, with the path moving in a series of right-angled turns. The empty spaces form a winding path that allows the player to move from the starting position to the goal.
