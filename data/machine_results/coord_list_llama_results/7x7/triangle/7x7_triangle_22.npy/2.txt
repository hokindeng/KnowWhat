You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since I can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals), I will explore all possible moves from the current position.

The current player position is (4, 1). The adjacent empty spaces are:

* (4, 0) (left)
* (4, 2) (right)
* (3, 1) (up)
* (5, 1) (down) - not possible, since (5, 1) is a wall
* (3, 0) (up-left) - not possible, since (3, 0) is a wall
* (3, 2) (up-right) - not possible, since (3, 2) is a wall
* (5, 0) (down-left) - not possible, since (5, 0) is a wall
* (5, 2) (down-right) - not possible, since (5, 2) is a wall

The possible next moves are:

* (4, 0)
* (4, 2)
* (3, 1)

Since the goal is (3, 3), I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. Therefore, my next move is:

(3, 1)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 1), I will explore all possible moves:

* (3, 0) (left) - not possible, since (3, 0) is a wall
* (3, 2) (right) - not possible, since (3, 2) is a wall
* (2, 1) (up) - not possible, since (2, 1) is a wall
* (4, 1) (down) - possible, but it's the previous position, so I won't choose it
* (2, 0) (up-left) - not possible, since (2, 0) is a wall
* (2, 2) (up-right) - possible
* (4, 0) (down-left) - possible
* (4, 2) (down-right) - possible

The possible next moves are:

* (2, 2)
* (4, 0)
* (4, 2)

Since the goal is (3, 3), I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. However, none of the possible moves directly lead to the goal. I will choose the move that gives me the most options for the next step.

I will choose:

(2, 2)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), I will explore all possible moves:

* (2, 1) (left) - not possible, since (2, 1) is a wall
* (2, 3) (right) - not possible, since (2, 3) is a wall
* (1, 2) (up) - not possible, since (1, 2) is a wall
* (3, 2) (down) - not possible, since (3, 2) is a wall
* (1, 1) (up-left) - not possible, since (1, 1) is a wall
* (1, 3) (up-right) - not possible, since (1, 3) is a wall
* (3, 1) (down-left) - possible
* (3, 3) (down-right) - possible, and it's the goal!

The possible next moves are:

* (3, 1)
* (3, 3)

Since the goal is (3, 3), I will choose the move that directly leads to the goal.

I will choose:

(3, 3)

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form an L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 6), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (6, 4)

Note that this new maze has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape.
