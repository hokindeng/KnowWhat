You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The current player position is (4, 1). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, and diagonals. However, we need to check which of these moves are valid by ensuring the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, the possible moves from (4, 1) are:
- Up: (3, 1) is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
- Down: (5, 1) is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Left: (4, 0) is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
- Right: (4, 2) is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
- Diagonals: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 0), and (5, 2) are not all valid moves since some of these positions are walls or out of bounds.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the goal position
The goal position is (3, 3). Among the valid moves, moving up to (3, 1) brings us closer to the goal position and is a strategic move towards reaching the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The current player position is (3, 1) and the goal position is (3, 3).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The possible moves from (3, 1) are up, down, left, right, and diagonals. However, we need to check which of these moves are valid by ensuring the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, the possible moves from (3, 1) are:
- Up: (2, 1) is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Down: (4, 1) is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
- Left: (3, 0) is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Right: (3, 2) is a wall, but (3, 3) is not directly accessible. However, moving right to (3, 2) is not possible, but moving right to (3, 3) could be possible if we find a valid path.
- Diagonals: Some diagonal moves might be valid, but they do not bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the goal position
Since moving directly to (3, 3) is not possible, we need to find an alternative path. Moving down to (4, 1) is a valid move, and from there, we can try to find a path to (3, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

- Right: (4, 2) is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
- Diagonals: Some diagonal moves might be valid, but they do not bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the goal position
Since moving up to (3, 1) brings us closer to the goal position (3, 3), we can try to move up and then find a path to the right.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 1)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The current player position is (3, 1) and the goal position is (3, 3).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The possible moves from (3, 1) are up, down, left, right, and diagonals. However, we need to check which of these moves are valid by ensuring the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, the possible moves from (3, 1) are:
- Up: (2, 1) is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Down: (4, 1) is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
- Left: (3, 0) is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Right: (3, 2) is a wall, but moving right to (3, 3) could be possible if we find a valid path.
- Diagonals: Some diagonal moves might be valid, but they do not bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the goal position
Since moving right is blocked by a wall at (3, 2), we need to find an alternative path. Moving down to (4, 1) is a valid move, and from there, we can try to find a path to the right and up to reach the goal.

However, considering the goal position (3, 3) is two steps to the right and we have a wall at (3, 2), we should look for a path that allows us to bypass the wall. Moving down to (4, 1) and then right to (4, 2) or (4, 3) could provide an opportunity to move up and reach the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The current player position is (4, 2) and the goal position is (3, 3).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The possible moves from (4, 2) are up, down, left, right, and diagonals. However, we need to check which of these moves are valid by ensuring the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, the possible moves from (4, 2) are:
- Up: (3, 2) is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Down: (5, 2) is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Left: (4, 1) is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
- Right: (4, 3) is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
- Diagonals: Some diagonal moves might be valid, but they do not bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the goal position
Since moving right to (4, 3) brings us closer to the goal position (3, 3), we can try to move right and then find a path up to reach the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The possible moves from (4, 3) are up, down, left, right, and diagonals. However, we need to check which of these moves are valid by ensuring the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, the possible moves from (4, 3) are:
- Up: (3, 3) is the goal position, but it's not directly accessible because (3, 3) is not explicitly listed as an empty space, however, it's the goal, so we should try to reach it.
- Down: (5, 3) is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Left: (4, 2) is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
- Right: (4, 4) is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
- Diagonals: Some diagonal moves might be valid, but they do not bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the goal position
Since moving up to (3, 3) would bring us directly to the goal position, we should try to move up.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 3)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), and (4, 4). These empty spaces form a general shape that can be recognized as a "L-shape" or a "corner" shape, but more specifically, it resembles a "staircase" or a "zigzag" pattern. However, considering the overall layout and the path from the player position to the goal, it's more accurate to describe the shape as a "bent" or "angled" corridor.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same shape
To generate a new maze with the same shape, we need to create a new set of empty spaces that form a similar "bent" or "angled" corridor. We will keep the same size as the original maze and ensure that there is a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Here is a new maze with the same shape:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

The final answer is: $\boxed{bent}$
