You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (3, 4), we need to identify all possible adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, and diagonals. We will check each direction to see if the adjacent space is empty.

## Step 3: Check the possible moves
- Up: (3, 3) is an empty space.
- Down: (3, 5) is a wall.
- Left: (2, 4) is a wall.
- Right: (4, 4) is an empty space.
- Diagonals: (2, 3) is an empty space, (2, 5) is a wall, (4, 3) is an empty space, and (4, 5) is an empty space.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
From the possible moves, we need to choose the one that brings us closer to the goal position (0, 1) while avoiding walls. Moving up to (3, 3) or diagonally to (2, 3) or (4, 3) would be a good choice as they are all closer to the goal and are empty spaces.

## Step 5: Select the most promising move
Considering the goal position is at the top left, moving diagonally to (2, 3) seems to be the most promising move as it reduces both the x and y distances to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has been updated to reflect the new player position at (2, 3). We need to analyze the current state to determine the next move.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From the current position (2, 3), we will check all adjacent spaces to see if they are empty.

## Step 3: Check the possible moves
- Up: (2, 2) is a wall.
- Down: (2, 4) is a wall.
- Left: (1, 3) is a wall.
- Right: (3, 3) is a wall.
- Diagonals: (1, 2) is an empty space, (1, 4) is a wall, (3, 2) is an empty space, and (3, 4) is an empty space but it's the previous position.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
From the possible moves, moving diagonally to (1, 2) seems to be the most promising move as it reduces both the x and y distances to the goal and is an empty space.

## Step 5: Select the most promising move
Considering the goal position is at the top left, moving diagonally to (1, 2) is the best option.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has been updated to reflect the new player position at (1, 2). We need to analyze the current state to determine the next move.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From the current position (1, 2), we will check all adjacent spaces to see if they are empty.

## Step 3: Check the possible moves
- Up: (1, 1) is an empty space.
- Down: (1, 3) is a wall.
- Left: (0, 2) is a wall.
- Right: (2, 2) is a wall.
- Diagonals: (0, 1) is the goal position, (0, 3) is a wall, (2, 1) is an empty space, and (2, 3) is an empty space but it's the previous position.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
From the possible moves, moving up to (1, 1) or diagonally to (0, 1) seems to be a good choice. However, since (0, 1) is the goal position, it's the most promising move.

## Step 5: Select the most promising move
Considering the goal position is at (0, 1), moving diagonally to (0, 1) is the best option.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(0, 1)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces that form a zigzag or a winding path, but more specifically, it resembles a "staircase" shape, with steps going up and to the left.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will try to replicate the staircase pattern while ensuring the maze is not an identical copy of the original.

## Step 3: Determine the size of the new maze
The new maze will have the same size as the original, which is 7x7.

## Step 4: Place the walls and empty spaces in the new maze
We will place the walls and empty spaces in a way that forms a staircase shape, while ensuring there is a valid path from P to G.

## Step 5: Encode the new maze
Here is the new maze encoded in the same format as the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 6)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Staircase}$
