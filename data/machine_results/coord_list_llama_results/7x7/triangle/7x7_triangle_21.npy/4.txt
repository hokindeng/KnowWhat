You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (3, 4), we need to identify the possible moves. We can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, from the current player position (3, 4), the possible moves are:
- Up: (2, 4)
- Down: Not possible due to a wall
- Left: Not possible due to a wall
- Right: Not possible due to a wall
- Diagonal up-left: Not possible due to a wall
- Diagonal up-right: Not possible due to a wall
- Diagonal down-left: Not possible due to a wall
- Diagonal down-right: Not possible due to a wall

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the only possible move is up to (2, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 4)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces that form a zigzag or winding path from the player position to the goal position.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a zigzag or winding path. We will place the walls in a way that creates a similar shape.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 1)

The final answer is: $\boxed{zigzag}$
