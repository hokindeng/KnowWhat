You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (3, 4), we need to identify the possible moves. We can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, from the current player position (3, 4), the possible moves are:
- Up: (2, 4)
- Down: Not possible due to a wall
- Left: (3, 3)
- Right: Not possible due to a wall
- Diagonal up-left: (2, 3)
- Diagonal up-right: Not possible due to a wall
- Diagonal down-left: Not possible due to a wall
- Diagonal down-right: Not possible due to a wall

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the possible moves, we should choose the move that brings us closer to the goal position (0, 1). Moving up to (2, 4) or diagonally up-left to (2, 3) are both viable options. However, moving diagonally up-left to (2, 3) is a more direct path towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (2, 3), we need to identify the possible moves. We can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, from the current player position (2, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up: (1, 3) is a wall, but (1, 2) is empty, so we can move up-left to (1, 2)
- Down: (3, 3) is a wall, but (3, 4) is empty, so we can move down to (3, 4) or down-right to (3, 4)
- Left: (2, 2) is a wall
- Right: (2, 4) is empty, so we can move right to (2, 4)
- Diagonal up-right: Not possible due to a wall
- Diagonal down-left: Not possible due to a wall
- Diagonal down-right: Not possible due to a wall

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the possible moves, we should choose the move that brings us closer to the goal position (0, 1). Moving up-left to (1, 2) is a more direct path towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

- Left: (1, 1) is empty, so we can move left to (1, 1)
- Right: (1, 3) is a wall
- Diagonal up-left: (0, 1) is the goal position
- Diagonal up-right: Not possible due to a wall
- Diagonal down-left: Not possible due to a wall
- Diagonal down-right: Not possible due to a wall

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the possible moves, we should choose the move that brings us closer to the goal position (0, 1). Moving diagonally up-left to (0, 1) is the most direct path to the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces that form a zigzag or winding path from the player position to the goal position.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will maintain the same size and create a winding path from the player position to the goal position.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 5)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (1, 1)

## Step 4: Verify the new maze
The new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as a zigzag or winding path.

The final answer is: $\boxed{zigzag}$
