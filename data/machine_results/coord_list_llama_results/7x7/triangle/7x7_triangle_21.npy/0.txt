You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (3, 4), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, but only to empty spaces.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine the available moves
Looking at the maze, from the current position (3, 4), the available moves are limited by the walls and the layout of the empty spaces. We need to find a path that leads towards the goal (0, 1) while avoiding walls.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Considering the goal is to the northwest of the current position, the best next move would be to move in a direction that brings the player closer to the goal while avoiding walls. Given the layout, moving diagonally or directly towards the goal is not possible due to the presence of walls. Therefore, we need to find an alternative route that eventually leads to the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Given the constraints and the objective to move closer to the goal, the next move should be to an empty space that is closer to the goal and does not lead to a dead end. Since the direct path is blocked by walls, we need to navigate around them.

## Step 6: Select the specific coordinates for the next move
Considering the available empty spaces and the need to move closer to the goal, the next move should be to a position that is both closer to the goal and not blocked by walls. Given the layout, moving to (4, 4) or (4, 3) could be options, but since we aim to move closer to the goal (0, 1), we should consider moving in a way that sets us up for a northwest trajectory.

## Step 7: Finalize the next move
Given the analysis, the best next move from (3, 4) would be to (4, 3), as it moves us closer to the northwest direction towards the goal while avoiding walls and keeping options open for further moves.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze after the last move
After moving to (4, 3), we need to reassess the maze to determine the best next move towards the goal (0, 1).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From (4, 3), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to adjacent empty spaces, while avoiding walls.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine the available moves
Considering the layout, moving directly towards the goal is still not possible due to the presence of walls. We need to navigate around them to find a path to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the best next move
Given the goal is to the northwest of the current position, the best next move would be to move in a direction that brings the player closer to the goal while avoiding walls. Since we are already at (4, 3), moving to (4, 2) could be a viable option as it moves us closer to the northwest direction.

## Step 5: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Considering the available empty spaces and the need to move closer to the goal, moving to (4, 2) seems like a reasonable next step. It keeps us on a path that could potentially lead to the goal while avoiding dead ends.

## Step 6: Select the specific coordinates for the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to (4, 2), as it moves us closer to the northwest direction towards the goal and keeps options open for further moves.

## Step 7: Finalize the next move
Given the analysis, the best next move from (4, 3) would be to (4, 2), as it aligns with our objective of moving closer to the goal while navigating around the walls.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces that form a winding path with several turns and changes in direction. However, upon closer inspection, it can be observed that the path resembles a zigzag or a serpentine shape, with the player navigating through a series of connected corridors.

## Step 2: Name the general shape formed by the empty spaces
Based on the observation in Step 1, the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze can be described as a "serpentine" or "zigzag" shape.

## Step 3: Generate a new maze with the same shape
To generate a new maze with the same shape, we need to create a new set of empty spaces that form a serpentine or zigzag path. The new maze should have the same size as the original maze and include a valid path from P to G.

## Step 4: Create the new maze
Here is a new maze with the same shape:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (1, 1)

The final answer is: $\boxed{serpentine}$
