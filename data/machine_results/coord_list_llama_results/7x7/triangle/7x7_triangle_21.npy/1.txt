You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
The current player position is (3, 4). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, as long as the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the adjacent positions
Looking at the maze, the adjacent positions to (3, 4) are:
- Up: (3, 3)
- Down: (3, 5) (wall)
- Left: (2, 4) (wall)
- Right: (4, 4)
- Diagonal up-left: (2, 3)
- Diagonal up-right: (4, 3)
- Diagonal down-left: Not possible due to wall
- Diagonal down-right: Not possible due to wall

## Step 4: Choose the next move
From the analysis in Step 3, the possible next moves are (3, 3), (4, 4), (2, 3), or (4, 3). Since the goal is to move towards the goal position (0, 1), we should prioritize moving up or left. Among the options, moving up to (3, 3) or diagonally up-left to (2, 3) are the most promising. However, since moving diagonally can sometimes provide a shortcut and (2, 3) is a valid empty space, moving diagonally up-left to (2, 3) seems like a good choice.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
The current player position is (2, 3). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, as long as the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the adjacent positions
Looking at the maze, the adjacent positions to (2, 3) are:
- Up: (2, 2) (wall)
- Down: (2, 4) (wall)
- Left: (1, 3) (wall)
- Right: (3, 3) (wall)
- Diagonal up-left: (1, 2)
- Diagonal up-right: Not possible due to wall
- Diagonal down-left: Not possible due to wall
- Diagonal down-right: Not possible due to wall

## Step 4: Choose the next move
From the analysis in Step 3, the only possible next move is diagonally up-left to (1, 2). This move is towards the goal position (0, 1) and is a valid empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 2)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces that form a zigzag or winding path from the player position to the goal position. However, upon closer inspection, it can be observed that the path resembles a more specific shape, which is a "bent" or "L-shaped" path with additional segments.

## Step 2: Determine the name of the general shape
Given the characteristics of the path, the general shape formed by the empty spaces can be described as an "L-shaped" path with extensions.

## Step 3: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to design a new set of empty spaces that form an L-shaped path with extensions, while ensuring that the maze is not an identical copy of the original and includes a valid path from P to G.

## Step 4: Define the new maze
Here is a new maze with the same shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shaped}$
