You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move closer to the goal position (1, 1) from the current player position (4, 4).

First, let's analyze the maze and the possible moves from the current position (4, 4). The goal is to reach (1, 1). Since we can move diagonally, we should prioritize moves that bring us closer to the goal in both the x and y directions.

Given the current position (4, 4) and the goal (1, 1), the most direct move would be diagonally up and to the left. However, we need to check if such a move is possible given the empty spaces and walls.

Looking at the empty spaces provided: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), we see that moving diagonally up and to the left from (4, 4) to (3, 3) is a valid move because (3, 3) is listed as an empty space.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 3), we need to continue moving towards the goal (1, 1). Given the available empty spaces, the most direct move would be diagonally up and to the left again. However, since (2, 2) is an empty space and it's closer to the goal, we can move to (2, 2) as our next step.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), we need to move closer to the goal (1, 1). Since we can move diagonally, the most direct move would be diagonally up and to the left. However, since (1, 1) is not directly accessible due to the wall at (1, 2), we need to find an alternative route.

Looking at the available empty spaces, we can move to (2, 1) as our next step. This move brings us closer to the goal and sets us up for a potential move to (1, 1) in the future.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 1), we can finally move to the goal position (1, 1) directly. Since there are no walls or obstacles between (2, 1) and (1, 1), we can make a diagonal move to reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape, but more specifically, it resembles a "L-shape" with a small extension.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape characteristics:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (2, 1)

This new maze has a similar L-shape with a small extension, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The player starts at the bottom-right corner (5, 6) and needs to navigate to the goal at (2, 1) through the empty spaces.
