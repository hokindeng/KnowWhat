You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, given the constraints of the problem and the format requested, I'll describe the approach and provide the next move directly.

Given the current player position (4, 4) and the goal (1, 1), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal while avoiding walls. The BFS algorithm would typically explore all possible moves from the current position, but since we're constrained to provide a single next move, we'll analyze the maze to determine the most promising direction.

Looking at the maze, the direct path from (4, 4) to (1, 1) is blocked by walls. However, there's a path that goes up and then left through the empty spaces. The most direct move towards the goal from (4, 4) would be to move up to (3, 4), but since (3, 4) is a wall, we need to find an alternative.

The next best move, considering the goal's direction and the layout of the maze, is to move diagonally up-left to (3, 3), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 3), we need to continue moving towards the goal (1, 1). Since we're already at (3, 3), which is an empty space, we can consider moving up, down, left, right, or diagonally.

Looking at the maze, moving directly up to (2, 3) is not possible because (2, 3) is a wall. However, we can move up-left to (2, 2), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), we need to continue moving towards the goal (1, 1). Since we're already at (2, 2), which is an empty space, we can consider moving up, down, left, right, or diagonally.

Looking at the maze, moving directly left to (2, 1) is possible, and (2, 1) is an empty space. This move brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 1), we need to continue moving towards the goal (1, 1). Since we're already at (2, 1), which is an empty space, we can consider moving up, down, left, right, or diagonally.

Looking at the maze, moving directly left to (1, 1) is possible, and (1, 1) is the goal. This move brings us directly to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or more specifically, a "staircase" shape, with a series of connected diagonal and horizontal segments.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape characteristics:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

This new maze has a similar staircase shape, but with a different arrangement of empty spaces and walls. The path from the player position (5, 4) to the goal (2, 1) can be navigated through the empty spaces, and the shape of the path is recognizable as a staircase.
