You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move closer to the goal position (1, 1) from the current player position (4, 4).

First, let's analyze the maze and the possible moves from the current position (4, 4). The goal is to find a path to (1, 1). Since we can move diagonally, we should prioritize moves that bring us closer to the goal in both the x and y axes.

From (4, 4), moving directly towards the goal is not possible due to the walls. However, we can see that moving diagonally or horizontally to the left could be beneficial as it reduces the distance to the goal in one axis.

Given the empty spaces and the goal to reach (1, 1), a reasonable next move from (4, 4) would be to move to a position that is closer to the goal and also leads us towards a path that can eventually connect us to (1, 1). Since (4, 3) is an empty space and moving to it would bring us closer to the goal by reducing the x-coordinate distance, it seems like a viable next step.

Therefore, my next move would be to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), we need to continue moving towards the goal (1, 1). Since we've already moved to (4, 3) and the space (4, 2) is empty, moving to (4, 2) would be a logical next step. This move brings us closer to the goal by reducing the y-coordinate distance and also keeps us on a path that could potentially lead us to (1, 1) by moving left in the future.

Therefore, my next move would be to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 2), we need to continue moving towards the goal (1, 1). Since we've already moved to (4, 2) and the space (4, 1) is empty, moving to (4, 1) would be a logical next step. This move brings us closer to the goal by reducing the y-coordinate distance and also keeps us on a path that could potentially lead us to (1, 1) by moving left in the future.

Additionally, moving to (4, 1) also brings us closer to the x-coordinate of the goal, which is 1. From (4, 1), we can potentially move left to (3, 1), which is also an empty space.

Therefore, my next move would be to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 1), we need to continue moving towards the goal (1, 1). Since we've already moved to (4, 1) and the space (3, 1) is empty, moving to (3, 1) would be a logical next step. This move brings us closer to the goal by reducing the x-coordinate distance.

Additionally, moving to (3, 1) also keeps us on a path that could potentially lead us to (1, 1) by continuing to move left in the future.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 1).

Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 1), we need to continue moving towards the goal (1, 1). Since we've already moved to (3, 1) and the space (2, 1) is empty, moving to (2, 1) would be a logical next step. This move brings us closer to the goal by reducing the x-coordinate distance.

Additionally, moving to (2, 1) also keeps us on a path that could potentially lead us to (1, 1) by continuing to move left in the future.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 1), we need to continue moving towards the goal (1, 1). Since we've already moved to (2, 1) and the space (1, 1) is adjacent to us, moving to (1, 1) would be a logical next step. This move brings us directly to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form an L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Note that this new maze has a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, and the general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape.
