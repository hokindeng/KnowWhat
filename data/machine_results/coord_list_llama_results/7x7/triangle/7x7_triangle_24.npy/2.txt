You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The current player position is (5, 6). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, as long as the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, the possible moves from (5, 6) are limited. The only adjacent empty space is (5, 5), which is diagonally up and to the left.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to (5, 5), as it is the only available empty space adjacent to the current player position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has been updated to reflect the new player position at (5, 5).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The possible moves from (5, 5) are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, as long as the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, the possible moves from (5, 5) are limited. The only adjacent empty space is (4, 4), which is diagonally up and to the left, or (5, 6), which is down and already visited.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the next move should be to (4, 4), as it is the only available empty space adjacent to the current player position that brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces that form a general shape resembling a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same size and shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a recognizable L-shape or bent corridor. We will place the player position (P) and goal position (G) at different locations to ensure the maze is not an identical copy of the original.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (3, 3)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$
