You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move towards the goal position (3, 5) from the current player position (5, 6).

First, let's analyze the maze and the goal:

- The goal is at (3, 5).
- The current position is at (5, 6).

Given the empty spaces and the goal, a direct path to the goal is not immediately clear due to the walls blocking direct movement. However, we can see that moving diagonally or in a combination of movements to reach the goal is necessary.

A possible first move, considering we want to get closer to the goal and avoid walls, is to move diagonally up and to the left, which would put us at a position closer to the goal and potentially open up more paths.

However, since we can only move to adjacent empty spaces, and given the constraints of the maze, our first move should aim to utilize the available empty spaces effectively.

Given the empty spaces provided, a logical first move from (5, 6) would be to move to (4, 6) since it's an adjacent empty space and moves us closer to the goal in a general sense, although it doesn't directly approach (3, 5). This move also keeps us flexible for the next steps, considering the maze's layout.

Therefore, my next move would be to (4, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and our position at (4, 6), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 5).

Looking at the available empty spaces, we can see that moving directly to (3, 5) is not possible due to the walls. However, we can move to (3, 6) which is an adjacent empty space and gets us closer to the goal.

From (3, 6), we can potentially move to (3, 5) in the next step, depending on the updated maze.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and our position at (3, 6), we can see that the goal is now directly below us at (3, 5).

Since we can move down to an adjacent empty space, and (3, 5) is indeed an empty space, we can make a direct move to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "L-shaped" or "Elbow-shaped" path.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shaped path:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (3, 3)

This new maze has a similar L-shaped path, but with a different configuration of walls and empty spaces. The path from the player position to the goal is still valid and can be reached through the empty spaces.
