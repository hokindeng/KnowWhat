You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
The current player position is (5, 6). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, but only to empty spaces. We need to examine the empty spaces and walls to determine the available moves.

## Step 3: Examine the empty spaces and walls to determine the available moves
Looking at the empty spaces, we see that there are empty spaces at (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), and (6, 6). However, we are currently at (5, 6), so we can only move to adjacent empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the adjacent empty spaces
The adjacent empty spaces to (5, 6) are (5, 5) and (6, 6), but since (6, 6) is not a step closer to the goal, we will prioritize moving to (5, 5).

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Based on the available moves and the goal position, the next move should be to (5, 5), as it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze

## Step 3: Examine the empty spaces and walls to determine the available moves
Looking at the empty spaces, we see that there are empty spaces at (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), and (6, 6). However, we are currently at (5, 5), so we can only move to adjacent empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the adjacent empty spaces
The adjacent empty spaces to (5, 5) are (4, 4) and (5, 6), but since (5, 6) is not a step closer to the goal, we will prioritize moving to (4, 4).

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Based on the available moves and the goal position, the next move should be to (4, 4), as it is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 4)}$

The adjacent empty space to (3, 4) is (3, 3) and (3, 5) is not an empty space but the goal, however, there is an empty space at (3, 6) but it is not adjacent, so we can move to (3, 3) or try to move to (3, 5) which is the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Based on the available moves and the goal position, the next move should be to (3, 5), as it is the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 5)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), and (6, 6). By examining these coordinates, we can see that the empty spaces form a rough "L" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will place the empty spaces in a way that forms a recognizable "L" shape. We will also ensure that the new maze is not an identical copy of the original maze and that there is a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L}$
