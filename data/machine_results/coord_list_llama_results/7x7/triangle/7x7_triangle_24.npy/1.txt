You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (5, 6), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where we can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the adjacent spaces
Looking at the maze, the adjacent spaces to (5, 6) are:
- Up: (5, 5)
- Down: Not possible due to the wall at (6, 6) being the current position, there's no space below.
- Left: (4, 6)
- Right: Not possible due to the wall.
- Diagonal: (4, 5) and (6, 5) are possible.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the goal position
The goal position is (3, 5). We need to move towards this position. Among the possible moves, moving diagonally to (4, 5) brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 5)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), and (6, 6). By examining these coordinates, we can see that the empty spaces form a rough "L" shape.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape but different layout
To create a new maze with the same "L" shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a recognizable "L" shape while avoiding the walls and ensuring a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Determine the size of the new maze
The original maze has a size of 7x7, so the new maze will also be 7x7.

## Step 4: Place the walls in the new maze
We will place the walls in a way that creates an "L" shape for the empty spaces while ensuring a valid path from P to G.

## Step 5: Place the empty spaces in the new maze
We will place the empty spaces in a way that forms a recognizable "L" shape.

## Step 6: Determine the player position (P) and goal position (G)
We will place P and G in a way that creates a valid path through the empty spaces.

## Step 7: Encode the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Empty: (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (3, 5)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L}$
