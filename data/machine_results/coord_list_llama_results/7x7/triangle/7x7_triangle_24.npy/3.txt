You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints of the maze and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, I will aim to move towards the goal position (3, 5) from the current player position (5, 6).

First, I will analyze the maze layout and the positions of the walls and empty spaces to find a viable path. Since the goal is to reach (3, 5) from (5, 6), and considering the positions of the walls and empty spaces, a direct path is not immediately apparent due to the wall layout. However, I can see that moving diagonally or in a combination of directions might offer a solution.

Given the current player position (5, 6) and the goal (3, 5), and considering the maze's layout, my next move would be to move diagonally up and to the left to get closer to the goal while avoiding walls. However, since the maze does not directly allow for a diagonal move from (5, 6) to a position that directly leads to the goal without hitting a wall, I will choose a move that gets me closer to the goal and avoids walls.

A viable next move, considering the constraints and aiming to get closer to the goal, would be to move to a position that is not directly blocked by walls and is closer to the goal. Given the empty spaces and the goal's position, moving to (4, 6) is not possible due to the wall at (4, 5) and (4, 6) being an empty space but not directly accessible from (5, 6) without going through a wall. Therefore, considering the available empty spaces and the goal's position, a logical move would be to aim for a position that can eventually lead to the goal.

Given the constraints and the layout, a possible move could be to position (4, 6) if it were directly accessible, but since it's not, and considering the need to avoid walls and move towards the goal, I will reassess the maze for a viable path.

Upon reassessment, considering the direct movement restrictions and the goal to reach (3, 5), and noting that moving directly to (4, 6) is not feasible due to the wall at (4, 5), a more viable approach would be to find an alternative route that avoids walls and utilizes the available empty spaces effectively.

Given the maze's layout and the goal, a more detailed pathfinding approach is necessary, considering each step's impact on the overall path to the goal. However, without the ability to move directly to certain positions due to walls, and aiming to provide a step-by-step solution, the initial analysis suggests moving towards the goal while navigating around walls.

Given the complexity and the need for a detailed step-by-step navigation, let's correct the approach for finding a viable next move:

1. **Reassess the Maze**: Given the walls and empty spaces, the direct path to the goal is blocked. The goal is to find a path around the walls.

2. **Identify Possible Moves**: From (5, 6), possible moves are limited by the walls. Moving diagonally or in a straight line to get closer to the goal while avoiding walls is the objective.

3. **Choose a Viable Move**: Considering the maze and the goal, a move that gets closer to the goal without hitting a wall is necessary. Given the constraints, moving to a position that sets up for a future move towards the goal is crucial.

Given the constraints and the need to navigate around walls, a detailed analysis of each possible move and its consequences on the path to the goal is required. However, the initial question asks for the next move without providing the full context of how to navigate through the maze with the given constraints directly.

To directly answer the question based on the initial analysis and the need to correct the approach for a detailed pathfinding solution:

Given the complexity of the maze and the constraints provided, a more detailed analysis is necessary to provide a step-by-step solution that accurately navigates from the player's position to the goal while avoiding walls and utilizing the empty spaces effectively.

However, to adhere to the format and provide a response based on the initial analysis and the constraints given:

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 6)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state and the current player position (4, 6), my next move will aim to get closer to the goal (3, 5) while avoiding walls.

Analyzing the maze, I notice that moving directly to the goal is still not possible due to the wall at (4, 5). However, I can see that moving to (4, 5) is not an option, but moving to (4, 4) is possible, and from there, I can reassess the path to the goal.

Considering the available empty spaces and the goal's position, my next move will be to position (4, 4), which is an empty space and gets me closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 4)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (3, 6)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces form an L-shape, similar to the original maze, but the maze is not an identical copy.
