You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution, we will analyze the maze manually.

First, let's visualize the maze:

The player position is (4, 5) and the goal is (2, 3). We can see that the player is currently in a relatively open area, with a clear path to the left and up.

Our next move should be to move up and to the left, towards the goal. The closest empty space to the player position that is also closer to the goal is (3, 5).

Therefore, our next move is to (3, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After analyzing the current state of the maze, I notice that the player position is (3, 5) and the goal is (2, 3). The closest empty space to the player position that is also closer to the goal is (3, 4).

However, I also notice that moving to (3, 4) would not bring us closer to the goal in the long run. A better move would be to move to (3, 3), which is a more direct path towards the goal.

Therefore, our next move is to (3, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "L-shaped" or "Elbow-shaped" path.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shaped path:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (2, 3)

This new maze has a similar L-shaped path, but with a different configuration of walls and empty spaces. The player position is still at (4, 5), and the goal is still at (2, 3).
