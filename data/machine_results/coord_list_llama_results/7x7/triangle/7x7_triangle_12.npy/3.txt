You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (4, 5), we need to identify the possible adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, we can see that the current position (4, 5) has adjacent empty spaces at (4, 4) and (3, 5). However, since the goal is to move towards the goal position (2, 3), we should prioritize moving upwards and to the left.

## Step 4: Choose the best move
Based on the analysis, the best move would be to move diagonally up and to the left to position (3, 4), but since (3, 4) is not an empty space, we will move to the available empty space that is closest to the goal and is an empty space, which is (3, 5).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (3, 5), we need to identify the possible adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, we can see that the current position (3, 5) has adjacent empty spaces at (3, 4) and (4, 5) and (3, 3). However, since the goal is to move towards the goal position (2, 3), we should prioritize moving upwards and to the left.

## Step 4: Choose the best move
Based on the analysis, the best move would be to move diagonally up and to the left to position (2, 4), but since (2, 4) is an empty space and is closer to the goal than (3, 4) or (3, 3), we will move to (2, 4) is not available from (3, 5) so we will move to (3, 4) then we can move to (2, 4) then to (2, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 4)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze appears to be a zigzag or a winding path, but more specifically, it resembles a "L-shape" with some additional connections.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will try to replicate the L-shape with some additional connections. We will place the empty spaces in a way that forms a recognizable L-shape, while also ensuring that there is a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (2, 3)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$
