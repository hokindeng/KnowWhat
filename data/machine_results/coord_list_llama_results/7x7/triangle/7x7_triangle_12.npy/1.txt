You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (4, 5), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. We need to examine the empty spaces and walls to determine the available moves.

## Step 3: Examine the empty spaces and walls to determine the available moves
From the given empty spaces, we can see that the adjacent empty spaces to the current position (4, 5) are (4, 4) and (4, 6). However, since we want to move towards the goal position (2, 3), we should prioritize moving up or diagonally up-left.

## Step 4: Choose the best move based on the available options
Considering the goal position (2, 3), the best move from the current position (4, 5) would be to move diagonally up-left to (3, 4), but since (3, 4) is not an empty space, we can move up to (4, 4) and then reassess our next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and the goal
The current player position is (4, 4), and the goal position is (2, 3). We need to navigate from the current position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From the current position (4, 4), we can move up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, since we want to move towards the goal position (2, 3), we should prioritize moving up or diagonally up-left.

## Step 3: Examine the empty spaces and walls to determine the available moves
From the given empty spaces, we can see that the adjacent empty space to the current position (4, 4) that moves us closer to the goal is (3, 3) or (4, 3). However, moving to (4, 3) would not bring us closer to the goal position (2, 3) as efficiently as moving to (3, 3) would.

## Step 4: Choose the best move based on the available options
Considering the goal position (2, 3), the best move from the current position (4, 4) would be to move diagonally up-left to (3, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current position and the goal
The current player position is (3, 3), and the goal position is (2, 3). We need to navigate from the current position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From the current position (3, 3), we can move up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, since we want to move towards the goal position (2, 3), we should prioritize moving left.

## Step 3: Examine the empty spaces and walls to determine the available moves
From the given empty spaces, we can see that the adjacent empty space to the current position (3, 3) that moves us closer to the goal is (2, 3) or (1, 3). However, moving to (1, 3) would not bring us closer to the goal position (2, 3) as efficiently as moving to (2, 3) would.

## Step 4: Choose the best move based on the available options
Considering the goal position (2, 3), the best move from the current position (3, 3) would be to move left to (2, 3), but since we can't move directly to the goal, we should move to the closest empty space to the goal which is (2, 3) is not an option, so we move to (2, 4) and then reassess our next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces that form a general shape resembling a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape, but with a different configuration
To create a new maze, we will maintain the same size (7x7) and shape (L-shape or bent corridor) as the original maze. However, we will rearrange the empty spaces and walls to create a new, non-identical maze.

## Step 3: Define the new maze configuration
Here is the new maze configuration:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (2, 6)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$
