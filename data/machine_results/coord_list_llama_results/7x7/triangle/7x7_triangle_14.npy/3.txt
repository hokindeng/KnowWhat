You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (4, 1) to the goal position (5, 4) while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, let's analyze the situation:

1. **Current Position**: (4, 1)
2. **Goal Position**: (5, 4)
3. **Empty Spaces**: (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)

From the current position (4, 1), the most direct path towards the goal (5, 4) while considering the available empty spaces would be to move towards the right and down, as moving directly to the goal is not possible due to the presence of walls and the specific layout of empty spaces.

Given the empty spaces, a logical next move would be to move diagonally down and to the right towards (5, 2) or directly down to (4, 2) if it were an empty space, but since (4, 2) is a wall, we focus on moving towards (5, 2) as it's an empty space and aligns with moving closer to the goal.

However, since (5, 2) is not directly adjacent to (4, 1) in a way that allows a single diagonal move without crossing a wall, and considering the instructions allow for diagonal moves to adjacent empty spaces, the best immediate move would be to move down to an empty space that is directly adjacent to the current position and then reassess from there.

Given the constraints and the layout, moving directly down to (4, 3) is not possible because (4, 2) is a wall, and moving to (5, 1) is the most direct adjacent move that gets us closer to the goal and utilizes an empty space.

Therefore, the next move should be to (5, 1), as it is an empty space directly adjacent to the current position and moves us closer to the goal position.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3)
Player position: (5, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we need to navigate from the current player position (5, 1) to the goal position (5, 4) while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

From the current position (5, 1), we can see that moving directly to the right is not possible due to the presence of walls and the specific layout of empty spaces. However, we can move down to an empty space that is directly adjacent to the current position.

A logical next move would be to move down to (5, 2), as it is an empty space directly adjacent to the current position and moves us closer to the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (3, 6)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-shape.
