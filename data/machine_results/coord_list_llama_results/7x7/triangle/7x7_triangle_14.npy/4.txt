You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (4, 1) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal to an adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the empty spaces, the closest empty space to the current player position (4, 1) that is also closer to the goal (5, 4) would be a move down to (5, 1) or a move right to (4, 3) since moving diagonally to (5, 2) is also an option but not directly closer to the goal than moving right.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (5, 4), moving right to (4, 3) is a step closer to the goal and keeps the option open to move down towards the goal in the next steps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a diagonal line or a straight path with a slight deviation, but given the constraints and the layout, it's more accurate to describe it as a "diagonal corridor" or simply a "diagonal path". However, considering the need to generalize the shape for a new maze, we can simplify this to a "diagonal line" or more broadly, a "diagonal shape".

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same size and a similar diagonal shape for the empty spaces
To create a new maze that meets the criteria, we need to ensure it has the same size (7x7 grid), includes a valid path from P to G through empty spaces, and forms a recognizable diagonal shape with its empty spaces. The new maze should not be an identical copy of the original.

## Step 3: Determine the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position for the new maze
Given the diagonal shape requirement, we can place the empty spaces in a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right of the maze, adjusting as necessary to ensure a valid path from P to G. We will place the player position (P) at one end of the diagonal and the goal position (G) at the other end.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (5, 4)

The final answer is: There is no specific numerical answer for this problem as it involves describing a shape and generating a new maze based on that shape.
