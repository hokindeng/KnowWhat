You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move towards the goal position (2, 3) from the current player position (1, 6).

First, let's analyze the maze and the goal:

- The goal is at (2, 3).
- The current position is at (1, 6).

Given the constraints of the maze, the most direct path to the goal while avoiding walls would be to move down and left. However, since we can only move to adjacent empty spaces, we need to find a path that adheres to this rule.

Looking at the maze, a possible first move could be to move down to (2, 6), as it is an empty space and directly below the current position. This move gets us closer to the goal's row and prepares us for further moves towards the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the goal position (2, 3), my next move would be to move left to (2, 5). This move is possible since (2, 5) is a wall, but (2, 6) is an empty space and moving left from (2, 6) would put me in a position to potentially move down towards the goal.

However, since (2, 5) is a wall, I must reconsider my move. A better option would be to move down to (3, 6), which is an empty space and gets me closer to the goal's column.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the goal position (2, 3), my next move would be to move left to (2, 6). This move is possible since (2, 6) is an empty space and gets me closer to the goal's row.

However, since moving left to (2, 6) would put me in a position that is not closer to the goal's column, I should reconsider my move. A better option would be to move up to (3, 5), but since (3, 5) is a wall, I must look for another option.

A better option would be to move up to (3, 4), which is an empty space and gets me closer to the goal's column.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (3, 5)

This new maze has a similar L-shape or bent corridor formed by the empty spaces, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The path from P to G can be reached through the empty spaces, and the maze meets the required criteria.
