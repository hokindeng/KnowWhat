You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move towards the goal position (2, 3) from the current player position (1, 6).

First, let's analyze the maze and the goal:

- The goal is at (2, 3).
- The player is at (1, 6).

Given the walls and the empty spaces, the most direct path to the goal while avoiding walls would be to move down and left. However, since we can move diagonally, we should prioritize diagonal moves when possible to reduce the number of steps.

From (1, 6), moving diagonally down and left is not possible directly due to the wall at (2, 5) and other obstacles. Therefore, the first move should aim to get closer to the goal while navigating around the walls.

A good first move would be to move down to (1, 5), as moving directly left is blocked by walls, and moving down keeps the option open for future diagonal moves towards the goal.

So, the next move should be to (1, 5).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze appears to be a "L-shape" or more specifically, a "hook shape" with a long vertical segment and a shorter horizontal segment that connects to the goal.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "hook shape":

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (2, 3)

This new maze has a similar "hook shape" formed by the empty spaces, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The path from the player position to the goal is still navigable through the empty spaces.
