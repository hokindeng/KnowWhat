You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (4, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The current player position is (2, 5). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, as long as the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces adjacent to the current player position
The empty spaces adjacent to the current player position (2, 5) are (2, 4) and (2, 6). However, since the goal is to move towards the goal position (4, 5), moving to (2, 4) or (2, 6) would not be the most efficient choice.

## Step 4: Look for alternative moves that bring the player closer to the goal
Since moving directly to the goal position (4, 5) is not possible from the current position (2, 5), we need to find an alternative move that brings the player closer to the goal. One possible move is to move down to (3, 5), but since (3, 5) is a wall, this move is not possible.

## Step 5: Choose the best available move
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal position, the best available move from the current player position (2, 5) is to move to (3, 4), which is an empty space and brings the player closer to the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (4, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (3, 4), and the goal is to reach position (4, 5).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The possible moves from the current player position (3, 4) are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, as long as the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the empty spaces adjacent to the current player position
The empty spaces adjacent to the current player position (3, 4) are (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 3), and (3, 6). However, since the goal is to move towards the goal position (4, 5), moving to (2, 4), (2, 5), or (2, 3) would not be the most efficient choice.

## Step 4: Look for alternative moves that bring the player closer to the goal
Since moving directly to the goal position (4, 5) is not possible from the current position (3, 4), we need to find an alternative move that brings the player closer to the goal. One possible move is to move right to (4, 4), but since (4, 4) is a wall, this move is not possible. However, we can move down to (4, 6) and then try to move left to (4, 5).

## Step 5: Choose the best available move
Considering the available empty spaces and the goal position, the best available move from the current player position (3, 4) is to move down to (4, 6), which is an empty space and brings the player closer to the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 6)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), and (5, 6). These empty spaces form a general shape that resembles a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will keep the same size (7x7) and create a new set of empty spaces that form a recognizable L-shape.

## Step 3: Define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position for the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 5)

However, to meet the criteria of not being an identical copy of the original maze, we will modify the empty spaces to form a new L-shape.

## Step 4: Modify the empty spaces to form a new L-shape
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)

The final answer is: 

(1) L-shape
(2) Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 6)
