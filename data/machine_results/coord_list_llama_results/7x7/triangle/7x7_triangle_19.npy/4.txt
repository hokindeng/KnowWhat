You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (4, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (2, 5), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, but only to empty spaces.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the shortest path to the goal
Looking at the maze, the goal position is (4, 5). Since the player is currently at (2, 5), the shortest path would involve moving right and down through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Considering the maze layout and the goal position, the next move should be to an empty space that brings the player closer to the goal. Since moving directly right is not possible due to walls, we look for the nearest empty space that allows progress towards the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the constraints and the objective to move closer to the goal, the next move should be to the empty space that is diagonally down and right from the current position, which is not directly available, so we consider moving down to (3, 5) is not possible due to a wall, thus we look for the next best option which is moving right to (2, 6) or down to a position that is not blocked by walls.

## Step 6: Select the optimal next move
Considering the options, moving right to (2, 6) is the most direct move towards the goal without hitting a wall, but since the goal is (4, 5), we should also consider moving down to get closer to the goal's y-coordinate. However, due to the wall at (3, 5), we cannot move directly down. Therefore, moving right to (2, 6) is the best immediate move, but we should plan to move down as soon as possible.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 6)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (4, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current state of the maze
The player is now at position (2, 6), and the goal is still at (4, 5). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From (2, 6), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to adjacent empty spaces. However, since the goal is to the right and slightly down, we prioritize moves that bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze for the shortest path to the goal
Given the current position and the goal, the shortest path involves moving right and slightly down through the empty spaces. However, there are walls blocking direct movement, so we need to find a path around them.

## Step 4: Determine the next move
Considering the maze layout and the goal position, the next move should be to an empty space that brings the player closer to the goal. Since moving directly right is not possible due to walls, we look for the nearest empty space that allows progress towards the goal.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
Given the constraints and the objective to move closer to the goal, the next move should be to the empty space that is diagonally down and right from the current position, but since that's not directly available, we consider moving down to (3, 6) as the next best option.

## Step 6: Select the optimal next move
Moving down to (3, 6) is the best immediate move as it brings us closer to the goal's y-coordinate and sets us up for further movement to the right.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 6)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces that form a shape resembling a "L" or a "bent corridor" with an additional segment extending upwards, but for simplicity, we can generalize it as an "L-shape" given the primary direction of movement from the player to the goal.

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same shape but different layout
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure it has an "L-shape" corridor but with a different configuration. The new maze should have the same size as the original (7x7) and include a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Determine the layout of the new maze
The new maze will have its "L-shape" corridor oriented differently. The player will start at one end of the "L" and the goal will be at the other end, with the path requiring movement along the length of the "L" and then a turn to reach the goal.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Given the complexity of describing each step in text for creating the new maze, we'll directly provide the encoded version of the new maze, ensuring it meets the criteria of having an "L-shape" corridor, being a 7x7 maze, and having a valid path from P to G.

New Maze:
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (4, 4)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$
