You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (3, 2) and the empty spaces, we can identify the possible moves. The player can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, from the current position (3, 2), the possible moves are:
- Up: (2, 2) is an empty space, so this is a valid move.
- Down: (4, 2) is a wall, so this is not a valid move.
- Left: (3, 1) is an empty space, so this is a valid move.
- Right: (3, 3) is an empty space, so this is a valid move.
- Diagonals: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), and (4, 3) are not all empty spaces, so we need to check each one. Only (2, 3) is an empty space, making it a valid diagonal move.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (3, 5), the best move would be to move right to (3, 3), as it brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (3, 3) and the empty spaces, we can identify the possible moves. The player can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, from the current position (3, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up: (2, 3) is a wall, so this is not a valid move.
- Down: (4, 3) is a wall, so this is not a valid move.
- Left: (3, 2) is an empty space, so this is a valid move.
- Right: (3, 4) is an empty space, so this is a valid move.
- Diagonals: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), and (4, 4) are not all empty spaces, and some are blocked by walls, so we need to check each one. Only (2, 4) is an empty space and not blocked, but moving diagonally would not bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (3, 5), the best move would be to move right to (3, 4), as it brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 4)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at coordinates (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), and the goal at (3, 5). These empty spaces form a roughly vertical corridor with some horizontal connections, resembling a "L" shape or more specifically, a "staircase" shape due to the step-like pattern of the empty spaces.

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will maintain the same size (7x7) and ensure there is a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G) through empty spaces. The new maze will not be an identical copy of the original and will have a recognizable "staircase" shape.

## Step 3: Define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position for the new maze
Walls: Most of the perimeter and internal blocks to create a staircase shape for the empty spaces.
Empty: Coordinates that form a staircase shape, ensuring a path from P to G.
Player position: A starting point that allows navigation through the empty spaces to the goal.
Goal: A position that can be reached by navigating through the empty spaces.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze
Given the constraints and objectives, here is a possible new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 5)

This new maze maintains the "staircase" shape of the empty spaces while providing a unique path from the player position to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{staircase}$
