You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (3, 2) and the empty spaces, we can identify the possible moves. The player can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the empty spaces, we can see that the player can move to (3, 3) or (3, 1) or (2, 2) or (4, 2) as these are the adjacent empty spaces.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since the goal is to reach (3, 5), we should move towards the right. However, there is no direct empty space to the right of the current position. We need to move around the walls to reach the goal. Moving to (3, 3) would be a step towards the goal, but we should also consider moving to (2, 2) or (4, 2) to explore other possible paths.

## Step 5: Select the most promising next move
Considering the goal position, moving to (3, 3) seems to be the most promising next move as it moves us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (3, 3), and the goal is to reach position (3, 5). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (3, 3) and the empty spaces, we can identify the possible moves. The player can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the empty spaces, we can see that the player can move to (3, 2) or (3, 4) or (2, 4) as these are the adjacent empty spaces.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since the goal is to reach (3, 5), we should move towards the right. Moving to (3, 4) would be a step towards the goal.

## Step 5: Select the most promising next move
Considering the goal position, moving to (3, 4) seems to be the most promising next move as it moves us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The player is currently at position (3, 4), and the goal is to reach position (3, 5). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (3, 4) and the empty spaces, we can identify the possible moves. However, there are no empty spaces directly adjacent to the current position that would move us closer to the goal.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the empty spaces, we can see that the player can move to (3, 3) or (3, 2) or (2, 4) as these are the adjacent empty spaces. However, these moves would not bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Consider alternative paths
Since we cannot move directly to the goal, we need to consider alternative paths. We can move to (2, 4) and then try to find a path to the goal from there.

## Step 5: Select the most promising next move
Considering the goal position, moving to (2, 4) seems to be the most promising next move as it allows us to explore alternative paths to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 4)}$

Since we cannot move directly to the goal, we need to consider alternative paths. However, there are no alternative paths that would allow us to reach the goal.

## Step 5: Realize the mistake
We should have noticed earlier that the goal position (3, 5) is actually a wall, not an empty space. This means that it is impossible to reach the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{No solution}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces
The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze is a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to design a new set of empty spaces that form an L-shape or a bent corridor. We will place the player position (P) at one end of the L-shape and the goal position (G) at the other end.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (5, 3)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$
