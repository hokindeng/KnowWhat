You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (3, 2), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where we can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the adjacent spaces
Looking at the maze, the adjacent spaces to the current position (3, 2) are:
- Up: (2, 2)
- Down: (4, 2) - This space is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Left: (3, 1)
- Right: (3, 3)
- Diagonal up-left: Not a valid move since (2, 1) is a wall.
- Diagonal up-right: (2, 3) - This space is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Diagonal down-left: Not a valid move since (4, 1) is a wall.
- Diagonal down-right: (4, 3) - This space is a wall, so it's not a valid move.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
From the analysis in Step 3, the valid moves are (2, 2), (3, 1), and (3, 3). Since the goal is to move towards the goal position (3, 5), the best next move would be to move right to (3, 3), as it brings us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (3, 3), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where we can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the adjacent spaces
Looking at the maze, the adjacent spaces to the current position (3, 3) are:
- Up: (2, 3) - This space is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Down: (4, 3) - This space is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
- Left: (3, 2) - This is the previous position, so it's not the best move.
- Right: (3, 4) - This is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.
- Diagonal up-left: Not a valid move since (2, 2) is not directly diagonal and (2, 3) is a wall.
- Diagonal up-right: Not a valid move since (2, 4) is not directly diagonal and (2, 3) is a wall.
- Diagonal down-left: Not a valid move since (4, 2) is a wall.
- Diagonal down-right: Not a valid move since (4, 4) is a wall.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
From the analysis in Step 3, the valid move that brings us closer to the goal is to move right to (3, 4).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (3, 4), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where we can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the adjacent spaces
Looking at the maze, the adjacent spaces to the current position (3, 4) are:
- Up: (2, 4) - This is an empty space.
- Down: Not a valid move since (4, 4) is a wall.
- Left: (3, 3) - This is the previous position, so it's not the best move.
- Right: (3, 5) - This is the goal position and is not blocked by a wall.
- Diagonal up-left: Not a valid move since (2, 3) is a wall.
- Diagonal up-right: Not a valid move since (2, 5) is a wall.
- Diagonal down-left: Not a valid move since (4, 3) is a wall.
- Diagonal down-right: Not a valid move since (4, 5) is a wall.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
From the analysis in Step 3, the valid move that brings us directly to the goal is to move right to (3, 5).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 5)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces at coordinates (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), and (3, 5). By examining these coordinates, we can see that the empty spaces form a roughly vertical path with some horizontal connections, resembling a "L" shape or more specifically, a "staircase" shape due to the step-like pattern of the empty spaces.

## Step 2: Generate a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will maintain the same size (7x7) and ensure that the empty spaces form a staircase-like pattern. We will also ensure that there is a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G) through the empty spaces.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Here is the new maze with the same shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (3, 5)

However, to meet the criteria of not being an identical copy of the original maze, we will modify the empty spaces to form a staircase-like pattern while maintaining a valid path from P to G.

## Step 4: Modify the new maze
Here is the modified new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 5)

The final answer is: 
(1) Staircase
(2) Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3),
