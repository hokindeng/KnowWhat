You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (3, 2) and the empty spaces, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, or diagonals to adjacent empty spaces. We need to examine the empty spaces to determine the available moves.

## Step 3: Examine the empty spaces to determine the available moves
From the given empty spaces, (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), we can see that the player can move to (3, 3) or (3, 1) as these are the only adjacent empty spaces.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the goal position
Since the goal position is (3, 5), we should move towards it. Moving to (3, 3) is a step closer to the goal compared to moving to (3, 1), which would be moving away from the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 5)

From the given empty spaces, (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), we can see that the player can move to (3, 2), (3, 4), or (2, 4) as these are the only adjacent empty spaces.

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the goal position
Since the goal position is (3, 5), we should move towards it. Moving to (3, 4) is a step closer to the goal compared to moving to (3, 2) or (2, 4), which would not bring us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

## Step 4: Choose the next move based on the goal position
Since the goal position is (3, 5), we should move towards it. However, there is no direct empty space to move to (3, 5). We need to find an alternative route.

## Step 5: Analyze the maze to find an alternative route
Upon analyzing the maze, we can see that there is no direct path to the goal position. We need to move to an adjacent empty space and then try to find a path to the goal.

## Step 6: Choose the next move based on the analysis
Moving to (3, 3) is a possible move, but it does not bring us closer to the goal. Moving to (2, 4) is also a possible move, but it also does not bring us closer to the goal. However, moving to (2, 4) might provide more options for the next move.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 4)}$

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 5)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces that form a general shape resembling a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same size and shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a recognizable L-shape or bent corridor.

## Step 3: Design the new maze
Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (3, 5)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$
