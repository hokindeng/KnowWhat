You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (4, 4), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, given the constraints of the problem and the format requested, I will describe the steps and reasoning rather than executing the algorithm directly.

1. **Current Position**: The player is at (5, 3).
2. **Goal Position**: The goal is at (5, 5).
3. **Available Moves**: From the current position, the player can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

Given the maze layout, the most direct path to the goal from the current position involves moving right. However, since the maze description does not explicitly allow diagonal moves in its problem statement (though it's mentioned in the general instructions), I will proceed with caution and consider only horizontal and vertical moves for simplicity.

**Next Move**: Since the goal is to the right of the current position and there are no walls or obstacles directly between the current position and the goal, the best next move is to move right.

Therefore, the next move would be to (5, 4), as it is an empty space and brings the player closer to the goal.

**Answer**: (5, 4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Path:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Vertical Line" or more specifically, a "Vertical Strip" since it's a collection of spaces that extend vertically.

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7), with empty spaces that form a similar vertical strip shape. Note that the player position (P) and goal position (G) are also included.

**Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 6)

**Empty:** (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)

**Player Position:** (5, 3)
**Goal:** (5, 5)

This new maze maintains the vertical strip shape of the empty spaces while providing a new path for the player to reach the goal.
