You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will analyze the maze and identify the possible moves from the current player position (2, 5).

The possible moves are:

* Up: (1, 5) ( blocked by wall)
* Down: (3, 5) (empty space)
* Left: (2, 4) (empty space)
* Right: (2, 6) (blocked by wall)
* Diagonal up-left: (1, 4) (blocked by wall)
* Diagonal up-right: (1, 6) (blocked by wall)
* Diagonal down-left: (3, 4) (empty space)
* Diagonal down-right: (3, 6) (blocked by wall)

Based on the analysis, the possible next moves are:

* Down: (3, 5)
* Left: (2, 4)
* Diagonal down-left: (3, 4)

I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal position. Since the goal position is (5, 5), I will choose the move down: (3, 5).

My next move is: (3, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the maze again and identify the possible moves from the current player position (3, 5).

The possible moves are:

* Up: (2, 5) (empty space, but already visited)
* Down: (4, 5) (empty space)
* Left: (3, 4) (empty space)
* Right: (3, 6) (blocked by wall)
* Diagonal up-left: (2, 4) (empty space)
* Diagonal up-right: (2, 6) (blocked by wall)
* Diagonal down-left: (4, 4) (empty space)
* Diagonal down-right: (4, 6) (blocked by wall)

Based on the analysis, the possible next moves are:

* Down: (4, 5)
* Left: (3, 4)
* Diagonal up-left: (2, 4)
* Diagonal down-left: (4, 4)

I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal position. Since the goal position is (5, 5), I will choose the move down: (4, 5).

My next move is: (4, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will analyze the maze again and identify the possible moves from the current player position (4, 5).

The possible moves are:

* Up: (3, 5) (empty space, but already visited)
* Down: (5, 5) (empty space, and it's the goal position!)
* Left: (4, 4) (empty space)
* Right: (4, 6) (blocked by wall)
* Diagonal up-left: (3, 4) (empty space)
* Diagonal up-right: (3, 6) (blocked by wall)
* Diagonal down-left: (5, 4) (empty space)
* Diagonal down-right: (5, 6) (blocked by wall)

Based on the analysis, the possible next moves are:

* Down: (5, 5) (goal position!)
* Left: (4, 4)
* Diagonal up-left: (3, 4)
* Diagonal down-left: (5, 4)

Since the goal position is (5, 5) and it's directly reachable, I will choose the move down: (5, 5).

My next move is: (5, 5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "L-shaped corridor".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shaped corridor:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (5, 4)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original, and the empty spaces form an L-shaped corridor that is recognizable as the same shape as the original maze. However, the maze is not an identical copy of the original, and it includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces.
