You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and given the constraints of the format, I'll describe the approach and provide the first move.

Given the player's current position is (2, 5) and the goal is (5, 5), we aim to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and staying within the empty spaces.

1. **Identify Possible Moves**: From (2, 5), we can potentially move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) to an adjacent empty space.

2. **Analyze Adjacent Spaces**: Looking at the empty spaces provided, the closest and most direct path towards the goal from (2, 5) would involve moving down or diagonally down to the right, as moving directly right or up would lead into walls or out of the maze.

3. **Choose the Next Move**: Given the empty spaces and the goal, a logical next move would be to move diagonally down to the right, aiming to get closer to the goal while staying within the empty spaces. However, since (3, 6) is a wall, we need to adjust our approach to ensure we're moving into an empty space.

Considering the empty spaces and the goal's position, a viable next move from (2, 5) would be to move down to (3, 5), as it's an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (3, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we'll continue to navigate towards the goal.

From the current position (3, 5), we can see that moving directly down to (4, 5) would be a straightforward step towards the goal, as it's an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (4, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we'll continue to navigate towards the goal.

From the current position (4, 5), we can see that moving directly down to (5, 5) would be a straightforward step towards the goal, as it's the goal position itself.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (5, 5)

This move should reach the goal, completing the maze navigation.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape characteristics:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (5, 4)

This new maze maintains the same size and shape characteristics as the original, with a recognizable L-shape or bent corridor formed by the empty spaces. The path from P to G is valid and can be reached through the empty spaces.
