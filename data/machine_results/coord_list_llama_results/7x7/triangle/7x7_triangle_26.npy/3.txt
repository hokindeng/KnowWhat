You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the player position to the goal position.

First, I will analyze the maze and identify the possible moves from the current player position (2, 5). Since I can move to any adjacent empty space, I will check the coordinates (2, 4), (2, 6), (1, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5) is already occupied by the player, so I will ignore it.

The possible moves are:

* (2, 4): This space is a wall, so I will ignore it.
* (2, 6): This space is a wall, so I will ignore it.
* (1, 5): This space is a wall, so I will ignore it.
* (3, 5): This space is empty, so I will consider it as a possible move.

Since (3, 5) is the only possible move, I will choose it as my next move.

My next move is: (3, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3, 5), I will analyze the possible moves from this position.

The possible moves are:

* (2, 5): This space is empty, but it's the previous position, so I will ignore it.
* (2, 4): This space is a wall, so I will ignore it.
* (2, 6): This space is a wall, so I will ignore it.
* (3, 4): This space is empty, so I will consider it as a possible move.
* (3, 6): This space is a wall, so I will ignore it.
* (4, 5): This space is empty, so I will consider it as a possible move.
* (4, 4): This space is empty, so I will consider it as a possible move.

Since (3, 4), (4, 5), and (4, 4) are possible moves, I will choose the one that is closest to the goal position (5, 5). In this case, (4, 5) is the closest, so I will choose it as my next move.

My next move is: (4, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4, 5), I will analyze the possible moves from this position.

The possible moves are:

* (3, 5): This space is empty, but it's the previous position, so I will ignore it.
* (3, 4): This space is empty, so I will consider it as a possible move.
* (3, 6): This space is a wall, so I will ignore it.
* (4, 4): This space is a wall, so I will ignore it.
* (4, 6): This space is a wall, so I will ignore it.
* (5, 5): This space is empty and it's the goal position, so I will consider it as a possible move.
* (5, 4): This space is empty, so I will consider it as a possible move.

Since (3, 4), (5, 5), and (5, 4) are possible moves, I will choose the one that is closest to the goal position (5, 5). In this case, (5, 5) is the closest and it's the goal position, so I will choose it as my next move.

My next move is: (5, 5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (5, 4)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original maze, and the empty spaces form an L-shape that is recognizable as the same shape as the original maze. The path from P to G is also valid and can be reached through empty spaces.
