You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or grid, such as this maze. However, since we're asked for a step-by-step solution and not the entire path at once, we'll adapt the approach to find the next best move towards the goal.

Given the current player position (3, 3) and the goal (6, 1), we'll consider all possible moves (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) and choose the one that moves us closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

1. **Current Position**: (3, 3)
2. **Goal**: (6, 1)

**Possible Moves from (3, 3)**:
- Up: (2, 3) - Wall
- Down: (4, 3) - Wall
- Left: (3, 2) - Wall
- Right: (3, 4) - Empty
- Diagonals:
  - Up-Left: (2, 2) - Wall
  - Up-Right: (2, 4) - Empty
  - Down-Left: (4, 2) - Empty
  - Down-Right: (4, 4) - Wall

Given these options, the best moves that bring us closer to the goal without hitting a wall are (3, 4), (2, 4), and (4, 2). However, since we're looking for the most direct path towards the goal (6, 1), moving down and to the right seems more promising as it generally aligns with the direction towards the goal.

**Next Move**: (4, 2)

This move is chosen because it moves us closer to the goal's general direction (down and right) while avoiding walls. It also keeps us on a path that could potentially lead to the goal with further moves.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the current player position (4, 2), we'll assess the possible moves to find the best next step towards the goal (6, 1).

**Possible Moves from (4, 2)**:
- Up: (3, 2) - Wall
- Down: (5, 2) - Wall
- Left: (4, 1) - Wall
- Right: (4, 3) - Wall
- Diagonals:
  - Up-Left: (3, 1) - Wall
  - Up-Right: (3, 3) - Empty
  - Down-Left: (5, 1) - Empty
  - Down-Right: (5, 3) - Wall

Considering the options, the best moves that bring us closer to the goal without hitting a wall are (3, 3) and (5, 1). However, since (5, 1) is directly down and to the right, aligning more closely with the direction towards the goal (6, 1), it seems like the more promising move.

**Next Move**: (5, 1)

This move is chosen because it moves us closer to the goal's general direction (down and right) while avoiding walls, and it directly aligns with the goal's column, making it a strategic step towards reaching the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the current player position (5, 1), we'll assess the possible moves to find the best next step towards the goal (6, 1).

**Possible Moves from (5, 1)**:
- Up: (4, 1) - Wall
- Down: (6, 1) - Empty (Goal)
- Left: (5, 0) - Wall
- Right: (5, 2) - Wall
- Diagonals:
  - Up-Left: (4, 0) - Wall
  - Up-Right: (4, 2) - Empty
  - Down-Left: (6, 0) - Empty
  - Down-Right: (6, 2) - Empty

Considering the options, the most direct and obvious move is down to (6, 1), which is the goal position. Since we can move directly to the goal without hitting a wall, this is the best and final move.

**Next Move**: (6, 1)

This move is chosen because it directly reaches the goal position, making it the most straightforward and efficient choice.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Original Maze's Path:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "Zigzag" or more specifically, a "Staircase" shape, given the diagonal and horizontal movements required to navigate from the player position to the goal.

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces that form a similar "Staircase" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (6, 1)

This new maze maintains the same size and general shape as the original, with a staircase-like path from the player position to the goal, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces.
