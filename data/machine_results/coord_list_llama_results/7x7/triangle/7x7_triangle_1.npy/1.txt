You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. This algorithm is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or matrix, which is the case here since all movements (up, down, left, right, or diagonals) are considered equal.

Given the current player position is (2, 4) and the goal is (0, 1), I will start by exploring all possible moves from the current position and then proceed step by step until I reach the goal.

The possible moves from (2, 4) are:
- Up: (2, 3)
- Down: Not possible due to a wall at (2, 5)
- Left: (1, 4) - Not possible due to a wall
- Right: Not possible due to being at the edge of the maze in this context
- Diagonals: (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 3), (3, 5)

Among these, (2, 3), (1, 5), and (3, 3) are valid moves since they are not blocked by walls and are within the maze boundaries.

However, since the goal is to reach (0, 1), moving towards the top-left direction is the most logical choice. Among the valid moves, (2, 3) is the most direct move towards the goal without going into a dead-end or moving away from the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to (2, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze appears to be a "Zigzag" or a "Winding Path" with a mix of horizontal and vertical segments. However, if I had to choose a more specific geometric shape, I would say it resembles a "Meandering Rectangle" or more simply, a "Wavy Line". But given the constraints and the shape's complexity, I'll simplify it to a "Wavy Line" or a "Sinusoidal Path".

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces that form a similar "Wavy Line" or "Sinusoidal Path" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (0, 2)

This new maze maintains a similar wavy line shape for the empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal while avoiding walls.
