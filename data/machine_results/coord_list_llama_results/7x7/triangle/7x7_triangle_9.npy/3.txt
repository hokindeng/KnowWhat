You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since I can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and four diagonals), I will explore all possible moves from the current position.

The current player position is (1, 3), and the goal is (1, 5). I will start by exploring the adjacent empty spaces.

The adjacent empty spaces to (1, 3) are:

* (1, 2)
* (1, 4)
* (2, 3) (not available, as it is a wall)
* (2, 2)
* (2, 4)

Since the goal is (1, 5), I will prioritize moving towards it. The closest empty space to the goal is (1, 4).

My next move will be to (1, 4).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (1, 4). Since the goal is (1, 5), I will try to move directly to it. However, I notice that (1, 5) is not an empty space, and I'm not allowed to move through walls.

In this case, I will explore the adjacent empty spaces to find an alternative path. The adjacent empty spaces to (1, 4) are:

* (1, 3) (already visited)
* (1, 2)
* (2, 4)
* (2, 3) (not available, as it is a wall)

I will move to (2, 4), which is an empty space and might provide a new path to the goal.

My next move will be to (2, 4).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2, 4). Since the goal is (1, 5), I will try to move closer to it. However, I notice that (1, 5) is still not an empty space, and I'm not allowed to move through walls.

In this case, I will explore the adjacent empty spaces to find an alternative path. The adjacent empty spaces to (2, 4) are:

* (2, 3) (not available, as it is a wall)
* (2, 2)
* (1, 4)
* (1, 3)
* (3, 4) (not available, as it is a wall)
* (3, 3)

I will move to (1, 4), which is an empty space and might provide a new path to the goal.

My next move will be to (1, 4).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Note: I'm essentially backtracking to a previous position, but I'm doing so to try and find a new path to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now back at position (1, 4). Since the goal is (1, 5), I will try to move directly to it. However, I notice that (1, 5) is still not an empty space, and I'm not allowed to move through walls.

In this case, I will explore the adjacent empty spaces to find an alternative path. The adjacent empty spaces to (1, 4) are:

* (1, 3)
* (1, 2)
* (2, 4)

I will move to (1, 3), which is an empty space and might provide a new path to the goal.

My next move will be to (1, 3).

Please update the maze to reflect my new position.

Note: I'm trying to find a new path to the goal, but it seems that the goal is blocked by a wall. I might need to explore other areas of the maze to find a solution.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (5, 5)

This new maze has the same size as the original and forms an L-shape with its empty spaces. The path from P to G can be reached through the empty spaces, and it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
