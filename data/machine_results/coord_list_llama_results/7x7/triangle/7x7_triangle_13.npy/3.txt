You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and given the constraints of the format, I'll describe the approach and provide the first move.

Given the complexity of the maze and the requirement to move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals), the BFS algorithm is suitable because it explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

1. **Initialization**: Start with the player's position (2, 6) and mark it as visited.
2. **Exploration**: Explore all possible moves from the current position. Given the constraints, possible moves from (2, 6) are limited due to the walls and the maze's layout. The only feasible move from (2, 6) that does not involve hitting a wall or moving out of the maze is moving down to (3, 6) or diagonally down-left to (3, 5), but since (3, 5) is a wall, the only viable move is down to (3, 6).

**Next Move**: (3, 6)

This move is chosen because it's the only move that doesn't result in hitting a wall or moving out of the maze's boundaries from the starting position (2, 6). After this move, the maze will be updated, and the next step would involve exploring moves from (3, 6), considering the updated maze configuration.

Please update the maze according to this move, and I'll be happy to guide the next step based on the updated configuration.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze configuration and the current player position (3, 6), the next move should aim to progress towards the goal (6, 6) while avoiding walls and utilizing the available empty spaces.

From (3, 6), considering the maze's layout and the available empty spaces, the most direct move towards the goal would be to move down to (4, 6). This move is feasible because (4, 6) is listed as an empty space, and it brings the player closer to the goal.

**Next Move**: (4, 6)

This move is chosen because it's a direct progression towards the goal, avoids hitting any walls, and utilizes an available empty space. After this move, the maze will be updated, and the next step would involve exploring moves from (4, 6), considering the updated maze configuration.

Please update the maze according to this move, and I'll be happy to guide the next step based on the updated configuration.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze configuration and the current player position (4, 6), the next move should aim to progress towards the goal (6, 6) while avoiding walls and utilizing the available empty spaces.

From (4, 6), considering the maze's layout and the available empty spaces, the most direct move towards the goal would be to move down to (5, 6). This move is feasible because (5, 6) is listed as an empty space, and it brings the player closer to the goal.

**Next Move**: (5, 6)

This move is chosen because it's a direct progression towards the goal, avoids hitting any walls, and utilizes an available empty space. After this move, the maze will be updated, and the next step would involve exploring moves from (5, 6), considering the updated maze configuration.

Please update the maze according to this move, and I'll be happy to guide the next step based on the updated configuration.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze configuration and the current player position (5, 6), the next move should aim to progress towards the goal (6, 6) while avoiding walls and utilizing the available empty spaces.

From (5, 6), considering the maze's layout and the available empty spaces, the most direct move towards the goal would be to move right to (6, 6). This move is feasible because (6, 6) is the goal position, and it's the final step to reach the goal.

**Next Move**: (6, 6)

This move is chosen because it directly reaches the goal position, avoiding any walls and utilizing the available empty space. After this move, the player will have successfully navigated the maze and reached the goal.

Please update the maze according to this move, and I'll be happy to confirm that the goal has been reached.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Empty Spaces:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze can be described as a "L-shaped" or "Elbow-shaped" corridor. The path starts from the top-left, moves horizontally to the right, and then turns downwards, forming an "L" shape.

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shaped corridor:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 6)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shaped corridor, similar to the original maze.
