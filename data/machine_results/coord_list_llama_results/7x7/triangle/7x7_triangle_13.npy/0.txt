You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we'll adapt our approach to accommodate these requirements.

Given the current player position is (2, 6) and the goal is (6, 6), we'll start by examining the possible moves from the current position and then proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze Possible Moves from (2, 6)

From (2, 6), considering the maze layout and the rules that we can move in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to an empty space, we look for adjacent empty spaces. The immediate adjacent empty spaces to (2, 6) are limited due to the walls and the current position being at the edge of the maze's open area.

### Step 2: Determine the Next Move

Given the constraints and the goal to reach (6, 6), we aim to move in a direction that brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls. Since we can move diagonally, we look for a path that efficiently uses this capability.

The next move should ideally be towards the goal, considering the diagonal movement capability. However, we must also consider the layout of the maze and the placement of walls to avoid getting stuck or moving away from the goal.

### Step 3: Choose the Optimal Next Move

Considering the maze's layout and the goal, a direct diagonal move towards the goal is not immediately possible due to the placement of walls. Therefore, we look for the next best move that aligns with our goal and avoids walls.

Given the empty spaces and the goal, moving down and to the right (diagonally) would be ideal, but we need to navigate around the walls. The immediate move to the right is blocked by walls, so we consider moving down first.

However, since we can move diagonally and there are no walls immediately below and to the right of our current position that would block a diagonal move, we can plan a diagonal move that aligns with our goal.

### Conclusion

Given the maze's layout and our ability to move diagonally, the optimal next move from (2, 6) would be to move diagonally down and to the right, aiming to get closer to the goal (6, 6) while navigating around the walls.

Therefore, the next move would be to (3, 5) or further if possible, considering the diagonal movement capability and the maze's layout. However, since the problem asks for a precise next move and given the constraints, we'll aim for a move that is directly diagonal and closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 5)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) General Shape of the Original Maze's Path

The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a **"L-shape"** with an extension towards the goal, allowing for diagonal movement to reach the goal position (6, 6) from the starting position (2, 6).

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7), with empty spaces that form a similar L-shape, allowing for a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G). The new maze is encoded in the same format as the original.

#### Walls:
(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)

#### Empty Spaces:
(1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)

#### Player Position:
(2, 6)

#### Goal:
(6, 6)

This new maze maintains the L-shape path with an extension towards the goal, similar to the original maze, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces to ensure a unique solution path.
