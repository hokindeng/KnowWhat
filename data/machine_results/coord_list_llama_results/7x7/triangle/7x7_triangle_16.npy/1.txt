You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (4, 3), we need to identify the possible moves. We can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, we can see that the current position (4, 3) is surrounded by walls on the left, right, and top. However, there is an empty space below the current position.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since the goal position is (6, 3), which is below the current position, the best next move would be to move down to the empty space (5, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has been updated to reflect the new player position (5, 3).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (5, 3), we need to identify the possible moves. We can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, we can see that the current position (5, 3) is surrounded by walls on the left, right, and top. However, there is an empty space below the current position, and also to the right and diagonally down-right.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since the goal position is (6, 3), which is below the current position, the best next move would be to move down to the empty space (6, 3), but since we can't move directly down because the space (6, 3) is not empty in the sense that it's the goal, we can move down-right to (6, 4) and then move left to (6, 3), or we can move right to (5, 4) and then move down to (6, 4) and then move left to (6, 3), or we can move right to (5, 4) and then move down-left to (6, 3), or we can move down-right to (6, 4) and then move left to (6, 3). However, the most efficient move would be to move down-right to (6, 4) and then move left to (6, 3).

However, since we can move diagonally, we can move directly to (6, 3) by moving down-right to (6, 3) but since the problem doesn't allow us to move to the goal directly, we will move down-right to (6, 4) and then move left to (6, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(6, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has been updated to reflect the new player position (6, 4).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (6, 4), we need to identify the possible moves. We can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, we can see that the current position (6, 4) is surrounded by walls on the left, right, and top. However, there is an empty space to the left of the current position.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Since the goal position is (6, 3), which is to the left of the current position, the best next move would be to move left to the empty space (6, 3), but since we can't move directly to the goal, we can move left to (6, 3) because it's the only possible move.

However, since we can move to the goal now, we will move left to (6, 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{(6, 3)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces that form a general shape resembling a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a recognizable L-shape or bent corridor. We will place the player position (P) and the goal position (G) at opposite ends of the L-shape.

## Step 3: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 3), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (6, 6)

Note that this new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-shape or bent corridor.

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
