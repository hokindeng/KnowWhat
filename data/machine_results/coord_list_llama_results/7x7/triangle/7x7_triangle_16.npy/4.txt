You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (4, 3), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the adjacent spaces of the current player position
Looking at the maze, the adjacent spaces of the current player position (4, 3) are:
- Up: (3, 3)
- Down: (5, 3)
- Left: (4, 2) - wall
- Right: (4, 4)
- Diagonal up-left: (3, 2) - wall
- Diagonal up-right: (3, 4) - wall
- Diagonal down-left: (5, 2) - wall
- Diagonal down-right: (5, 4)

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the possible next moves are (3, 3), (5, 3), and (4, 4). However, since the goal is to reach (6, 3), moving down to (5, 3) is the most direct step towards the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze has been updated to reflect the new player position (5, 3) after the previous move.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position is (5, 3), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal.

## Step 3: Analyze the adjacent spaces of the current player position
Looking at the maze, the adjacent spaces of the current player position (5, 3) are:
- Up: (4, 3)
- Down: (6, 3) - goal position
- Left: (5, 2) - wall
- Right: (5, 4)
- Diagonal up-left: (4, 2) - wall
- Diagonal up-right: (4, 4)
- Diagonal down-left: (6, 2) - wall
- Diagonal down-right: (6, 4)

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the analysis, the most direct step towards the goal is to move down to (6, 3), which is the goal position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(6, 3)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces that form a shape resembling a diagonal line with a small branch. However, a more general description would be that the empty spaces form a shape that can be recognized as a "L-shape" or a "corner" with an extension.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will maintain the same size (7x7) and ensure that the empty spaces form a recognizable L-shape or corner with an extension.

## Step 3: Define the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position for the new maze
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (6, 6)

The final answer is: There is no numerical answer to this problem as it requires a descriptive and visual response.
