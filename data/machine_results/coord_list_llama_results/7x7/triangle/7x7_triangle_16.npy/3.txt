You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
Given the current player position (4, 3), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. However, we need to check which of these moves are valid by ensuring the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine valid moves
Looking at the maze, the current player position (4, 3) has a wall to the left, up, and down. The only valid move is to the right, which is an empty space (4, 4), or diagonally down-right to (5, 4) or down-left is not possible due to walls.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (6, 3) is to the right and down from the current position, the most direct move would be to move down-right. However, since moving directly down is blocked by a wall, the next best move is to move right to (4, 4) and then reassess the situation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Assess the current situation
The player is now at position (4, 4), and the goal is to reach (6, 3). We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

## Step 2: Identify possible moves
From the current position (4, 4), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally. However, we need to check which of these moves are valid by ensuring the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to determine valid moves
Looking at the maze, the current player position (4, 4) has a wall to the left and up. The possible moves are down, right, or diagonally down-right.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the goal position (6, 3) is to the right and down from the current position, the most direct move would be to move down-right. However, since moving directly down is not blocked, we can move down to (5, 4) or right to (4, 5) and then reassess the situation. Moving down seems more promising as it gets us closer to the goal's y-coordinate.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 4)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces that form a roughly diagonal shape from the top-left to the bottom-right, with some deviations. However, considering the constraints and the path from the player position to the goal, the general shape can be described as a "Diagonal Channel" or more broadly, a "Diagonal Path".

## Step 2: Design a new maze with the same shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a diagonal path from the top-left to the bottom-right. We will place the player position (P) at one end of this path and the goal position (G) at the other end.

## Step 3: Encode the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0)
Player position: (0, 6)
Goal: (6, 0)

The final answer is: $\boxed{Diagonal Path}$
