You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the maze is relatively small and we're asked for a step-by-step solution, we can also approach this by visually analyzing the maze and making logical moves towards the goal.

Given the maze's layout, the player's position is at (1, 4), and the goal is at (0, 6). The player can only move through empty spaces.

1. **Initial Position**: The player is at (1, 4).
2. **First Move**: Since the goal is to the left and up, and there's an empty space at (0, 4) directly above the player, the first move should be up to (0, 4).

However, considering the constraints and the goal's position, the direct path to the goal involves moving up and then left. But since the space directly above the player at (0, 4) is empty, we can move up first.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (0, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, the player is now at (0, 4), and the goal is still at (0, 6). The player needs to move up to reach the goal.

Since the space directly above the player at (0, 5) is empty, the next logical move is to move up to (0, 5).

**Next Move Coordinates**: (0, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (0, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, the player is now at (0, 5), and the goal is still at (0, 6). The player needs to move up to reach the goal.

Since the space directly above the player at (0, 6) is the goal, the next logical move is to move up to (0, 6).

**Next Move Coordinates**: (0, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 6)

This new maze has the same L-shape formed by the empty spaces, but with a different configuration of walls and a new player position and goal.
