You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the maze is relatively small and we're asked for a step-by-step solution, we can also approach this by visually inspecting the maze and making moves based on the goal's direction.

Given the player's current position is (2, 3) and the goal is (4, 1), we need to move down and left. However, the direct path is blocked by walls, so we'll have to navigate around them.

The first move should aim to get closer to the goal while avoiding walls. Since moving directly left is blocked by a wall at (2, 2), and moving down is not possible due to the wall at (3, 3) being part of a larger barrier, our best initial move is to go up to (2, 2) to then move left or find another path down.

However, considering the layout and the goal of reaching (4, 1), a more strategic first move would be to move down to (3, 3), but since that's blocked, we actually need to think about moving in a way that sets us up for future moves. Given the constraints, moving up to (2, 2) is indeed a viable first step to explore the maze further and potentially find a path down or left.

So, the next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at (2, 2), we need to reassess our path to the goal (4, 1). Moving left is not possible due to the wall at (1, 2), and moving up is also not possible due to the wall at (2, 1) being part of the initial barrier. However, we can move down to (3, 2) or right to (2, 3), but since we came from (2, 3), moving right would be backtracking.

The best move from (2, 2) is to move down to (3, 2), as it gets us closer to the goal and potentially sets us up for a leftward move in the future.

So, the next move is to (3, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or more specifically, a "bent corridor" or "elbow shape".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape characteristics:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

This new maze has the same L-shape or bent corridor shape as the original, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The path from P to G is still navigable through the empty spaces.
