You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a simple pathfinding approach since the maze is relatively small and straightforward. Given the player's current position is (1, 3) and the goal is (3, 3), we aim to move towards the goal while avoiding walls.

First, let's analyze the maze structure based on the provided information:

- The player is at (1, 3).
- The goal is at (3, 3).
- The empty spaces (path) are: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2).

Given the constraints and the layout, the most direct path to the goal would involve moving down and right from the current position. However, since we can only move to adjacent empty spaces, we need to find a path that connects the current position to the goal through these empty spaces.

A possible first move, considering the empty spaces and the goal's position, would be to move down to (2, 3), as it is an adjacent empty space that brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we're now at position (2, 3) and the goal is still at (3, 3). Since we're already on the same column as the goal, our next move should aim to move right to reach the goal.

However, we notice that the space directly to the right of our current position, (3, 3), is not listed as an empty space in the current state. This seems to be an oversight, as the goal is indeed at (3, 3), and we should be able to move there.

Assuming the goal position (3, 3) is indeed an empty space that we can move to, our next move would be to move right to (3, 3), which would put us at the goal position.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form an L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (6, 6)

This new maze has an L-shaped path formed by the empty spaces, and it meets the criteria of having a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces, while not being an identical copy of the original maze.
