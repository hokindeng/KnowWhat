You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a simple pathfinding approach since the maze is relatively small and the goal is to find a step-by-step solution rather than the shortest path necessarily. Given the player's current position (4, 3) and the goal (4, 1), we aim to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and staying on empty spaces.

1. **Current Position**: (4, 3)
2. **Goal**: (4, 1)

Looking at the maze, the most direct path to the goal from the current position would involve moving up. However, we need to check the path for any obstacles (walls) and ensure we're moving through empty spaces.

- **Step 1**: Move up from (4, 3) to (3, 3). However, since (3, 3) is not listed as an empty space and is actually a wall according to the problem statement, we cannot move directly up. We need to find an alternative route.

Given the constraints and the layout of the maze, a viable first step would be to move to an adjacent empty space that brings us closer to the goal or at least does not move us further away. Since moving directly up is blocked by a wall, and moving down would take us further from the goal, we should consider moving left or right.

- **Alternative Step 1**: Since moving directly up is not possible due to the wall at (3, 3), and moving down would be counterproductive, we look at moving left or right. Moving right is not an option since (4, 4) is a wall. Therefore, the best initial move, given the constraints, is to move left to (4, 2), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal horizontally.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (4, 2)

This move keeps us on the path towards the goal while avoiding walls and utilizing the available empty spaces.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (4, 2), we aim to move closer to the goal at (4, 1).

Since the goal is directly to the left of the current position, and there are no walls blocking this path, the most straightforward move would be to move left.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (4, 1)

This move directly aligns with the goal and does not require navigating through any walls or blocked paths.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "L-shape" or more specifically, a "bent corridor" or "elbow-shaped path". However, for simplicity, let's refer to it as an "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (4, 1)

This new maze maintains the same size and includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G) through empty spaces. The empty spaces form an L-shape, similar to the original maze but with a different configuration.
