You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a simple pathfinding approach since the maze is relatively small and straightforward. Given the player's current position (1, 2) and the goal position (3, 2), we aim to move towards the goal while avoiding walls.

1. **Current Position**: (1, 2)
2. **Goal Position**: (3, 2)

Since the goal is directly to the right of the current position, and there are no walls blocking the path in the horizontal direction at the current y-coordinate (2), we can move directly towards the goal.

**Next Move**: (2, 2)

This move is valid because (2, 2) is an empty space, and it brings us closer to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we're now at position (2, 2) and aiming to reach the goal at (3, 2). However, we notice that the direct path to the goal is blocked by a wall at (3, 2) is not present, but (2, 3) is a wall, and (3, 2) is not listed as an empty space. We need to navigate around the obstacles.

Since we cannot move directly to (3, 2) due to it not being an empty space, we should move to a position that brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls. The empty space (3, 3) is a viable option, but we need to get there without moving into a wall.

**Next Move**: (2, 3) is a wall, so we move to (2, 4) instead, which is an empty space and gets us closer to the goal in a roundabout way.

This move is valid because (2, 4) is an empty space, and it sets us up for further moves towards the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Original Maze's Empty Spaces:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze can be described as a "Vertical Channel" or a "Vertical Corridor". This is because the empty spaces are primarily aligned vertically, creating a narrow channel or corridor that allows movement from the top to the bottom of the maze.

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze with the same size and shape characteristics as the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (5, 2)

This new maze has the same size as the original and features a vertical channel or corridor formed by the empty spaces, allowing movement from the player's position to the goal. The shape is recognizable as a vertical channel, and the maze is not an identical copy of the original.
