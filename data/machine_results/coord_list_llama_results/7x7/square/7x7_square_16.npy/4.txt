You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a simple pathfinding approach since the maze is relatively small and we're only moving in four directions (up, down, left, right). Given the player's current position and the goal, we'll aim to move closer to the goal with each step.

Current Player Position: (1, 5)
Goal Position: (1, 1)

Since the goal is directly above the player's current position, the most straightforward path would be to move up. However, we need to check if the space above is empty and not a wall.

Looking at the empty spaces provided: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), we notice that moving directly up from (1, 5) to (1, 4) is not listed, but moving further up to (1, 1) is not directly possible due to the wall at (1, 2), (1, 3), and (1, 4). However, we can see that (0, 5) is empty, suggesting we can move left to (0, 5) and then navigate from there.

Given the constraints and the layout, the first move should aim to get closer to the goal while avoiding walls. Since moving directly up is blocked by walls, and moving left to (0, 5) is possible, we'll choose to move left.

Next Move: (0, 5)

This move is chosen to navigate around the walls and find a path that can eventually lead to the goal at (1, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze appears to be a "L-shape" or more specifically, a "bent corridor" or "elbow shape", where the path from the player to the goal involves navigating around a corner.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shape or bent corridor:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 5), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (1, 1)

This new maze maintains the same size and has a valid path from the player to the goal through empty spaces. The empty spaces form a recognizable L-shape or bent corridor, similar to the original maze, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces.
