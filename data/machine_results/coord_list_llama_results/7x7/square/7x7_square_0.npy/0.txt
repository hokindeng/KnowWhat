You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since we are only asked for the next move and not the entire path, we can simplify the process by analyzing the maze manually for the first step.

Given the player's current position at (4, 2) and the goal at (0, 2), the most direct path would involve moving up. However, we need to navigate around the walls.

Looking at the maze, the player is currently at (4, 2), and the goal is at (0, 2). The direct path upwards is blocked by walls at (3, 2) is not blocked, but moving directly up from (4, 2) to (3, 2) is possible.

Therefore, the next move should be to move up to (3, 2).

The answer is: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze, we need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 2). Since the direct path upwards is blocked by walls at (2, 2) is empty, we can move up to (2, 2).

Therefore, the next move should be to move up to (2, 2).

The answer is: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze, we need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 2). Since the direct path upwards is blocked by walls at (1, 2) is empty, we can move left to (1, 2).

Therefore, the next move should be to move left to (1, 2).

The answer is: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze, we need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 2). Since the goal is directly to the left, we can move left to (0, 2).

Therefore, the next move should be to move left to (0, 2).

The answer is: (0, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or more specifically, a "staircase" shape, with a vertical path and a horizontal path that connect to form an L-shape.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 6)

This new maze has the same size and shape as the original, with a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-shape or staircase shape.
