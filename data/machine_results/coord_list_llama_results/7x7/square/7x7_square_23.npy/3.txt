You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since the maze is relatively small, BFS should be efficient enough to find the shortest path to the goal.

First, I will analyze the current state of the maze:

* Player position: (1, 5)
* Goal: (4, 4)
* Empty spaces adjacent to the player position: (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5) is not available since it's a wall, but (2, 6) is available.

My next move will be to move down to the empty space at (1, 4), since it's the closest empty space to the goal.

Next move: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1, 4), I'll analyze the available moves:

* Up: (1, 3) is an empty space, but it's not closer to the goal.
* Down: (1, 5) is an empty space, but I just came from there.
* Left: Not possible, since (1, 3) is not a better option.
* Right: Not possible, since (1, 5) is not a better option.
* Moving to the right is not possible since the space is a wall, however moving down and then right is possible.

However, I can move down to (2, 4), but it's a wall. So, I'll move down to (2, 3) and then right.

My next move will be to move down to the empty space at (2, 3).

Next move: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2, 3), I'll analyze the available moves:

* Up: Not possible, since (1, 3) is not a better option.
* Down: (3, 3) is an empty space, and it's closer to the goal.
* Left: Not possible, since (2, 2) is a wall.
* Right: (2, 4) is a wall, so I'll move down instead.

My next move will be to move down to the empty space at (3, 3).

Next move: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3, 3), I'll analyze the available moves:

* Up: Not possible, since (2, 3) is not a better option.
* Down: (4, 3) is an empty space, and it's closer to the goal.
* Left: Not possible, since (3, 2) is a wall.
* Right: (3, 4) is a wall, so I'll move down instead.

My next move will be to move down to the empty space at (4, 3).

Next move: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4, 3), I'll analyze the available moves:

* Up: Not possible, since (3, 3) is not a better option.
* Down: Not possible, since (5, 3) is a wall.
* Left: Not possible, since (4, 2) is a wall.
* Right: (4, 4) is the goal, and it's an empty space.

My next move will be to move right to the goal at (4, 4).

Next move: (4, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze has the same L-shape or bent corridor shape as the original maze, but with a different configuration of walls and empty spaces. The path from P to G is still valid and can be reached through the empty spaces.
