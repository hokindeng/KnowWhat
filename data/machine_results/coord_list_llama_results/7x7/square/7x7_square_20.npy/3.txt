You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since I'm given the initial state of the maze, I'll start by analyzing the possible moves from the current player position (5, 1).

From the current position (5, 1), I can move up, down, left, or right. However, I can only move to empty spaces. Let's examine the possible moves:

* Up: (4, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move up.
* Down: (6, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
* Left: (5, 0) is an empty space, so I can move left.
* Right: (5, 2) is an empty space, so I can move right.

Since my goal is to reach (2, 0), I'll choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. Moving left to (5, 0) seems like a good option, as it allows me to potentially move up and explore more of the maze.

My next move is: (5, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 0), I can move up, down, left, or right. However, I can only move to empty spaces. Let's examine the possible moves:

* Up: (4, 0) is an empty space, so I can move up.
* Down: (6, 0) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
* Left: There is no space to the left, as I'm already at the leftmost column.
* Right: (5, 1) is an empty space, but moving right would take me away from the goal.

Since my goal is to reach (2, 0), I'll choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. Moving up to (4, 0) seems like a good option, as it allows me to potentially move up and explore more of the maze.

My next move is: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 0), I can move up, down, left, or right. However, I can only move to empty spaces. Let's examine the possible moves:

* Up: (3, 0) is an empty space, so I can move up.
* Down: (5, 0) is an empty space, but moving down would take me away from the goal.
* Left: There is no space to the left, as I'm already at the leftmost column of the current row.
* Right: (4, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move right.

Since my goal is to reach (2, 0), I'll choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. Moving up to (3, 0) seems like a good option, as it allows me to potentially move up and explore more of the maze.

My next move is: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 0), I can move up, down, left, or right. However, I can only move to empty spaces. Let's examine the possible moves:

* Up: There is no space above, as I'm already at the topmost row of the current column.
* Down: (4, 0) is an empty space, but moving down would take me away from the goal.
* Left: (2, 0) is an empty space and is also the goal, so I can move left.
* Right: (4, 0) is an empty space, but moving right would take me away from the goal.

Since my goal is to reach (2, 0), I'll choose the move that brings me directly to the goal. Moving left to (2, 0) seems like the best option.

My next move is: (2, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Labyrinthine Path" or more specifically, a "Meandering Channel". However, if I had to choose a more geometric shape, I would say it resembles a "Winding Rectangle" or a "Sinuous Rectangle".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape characteristics:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (0, 6)

This new maze has a winding rectangular shape, with a meandering channel that connects the player position to the goal. The path is not a straight line, but rather a sinuous route that navigates through the empty spaces.
