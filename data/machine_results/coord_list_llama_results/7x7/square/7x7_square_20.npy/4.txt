You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since the maze is relatively small, BFS should be sufficient to find the shortest path.

First, I will analyze the maze and identify the possible moves from the current player position (5, 1).

From (5, 1), I can move up to (4, 1), but since (4, 1) is not in the list of empty spaces, I will not consider this move.

I can move down to (6, 1), but since (6, 1) is a wall, I will not consider this move.

I can move left to (5, 0), which is an empty space.

I can move right to (5, 2), which is an empty space.

Since my goal is to reach (2, 0), I will prioritize moving left to (5, 0), which seems to be a more promising direction.

Therefore, my next move will be to (5, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (5, 0), I can analyze the possible moves.

I can move up to (4, 0), which is an empty space.

I can move down to (6, 0), but since (6, 0) is a wall, I will not consider this move.

I can move left to (5, -1), but since this is outside the maze boundaries, I will not consider this move.

I can move right to (5, 1), which is an empty space, but since I just came from there, I will not consider this move.

Since my goal is to reach (2, 0), I will prioritize moving up to (4, 0), which seems to be a more promising direction.

Therefore, my next move will be to (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 0), I can analyze the possible moves.

I can move up to (3, 0), which is an empty space.

I can move down to (5, 0), but since I just came from there, I will not consider this move.

I can move left to (4, -1), but since this is outside the maze boundaries, I will not consider this move.

I can move right to (4, 1), but since (4, 1) is a wall, I will not consider this move.

Since my goal is to reach (2, 0), I will prioritize moving up to (3, 0), which seems to be a more promising direction.

Therefore, my next move will be to (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 0), I can analyze the possible moves.

I can move up to (2, 0), which is the goal position.

I can move down to (4, 0), but since I just came from there, I will not consider this move.

I can move left to (3, -1), but since this is outside the maze boundaries, I will not consider this move.

I can move right to (3, 1), but since (3, 1) is a wall, I will not consider this move.

Since I can move directly to the goal position, I will do so.

Therefore, my next move will be to (2, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (2, 6)

This new maze has a similar L-shape or bent corridor shape, but with a different configuration of walls and empty spaces. The player can navigate from the starting position (5, 6) to the goal position (2, 6) through the empty spaces.
