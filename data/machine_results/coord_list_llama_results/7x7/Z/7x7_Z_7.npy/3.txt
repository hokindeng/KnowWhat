You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (2, 4), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we will examine the neighboring positions.

## Step 3: Examine the neighboring positions
Looking at the maze, the neighboring positions of (2, 4) are:
- Up: (2, 3)
- Down: (2, 5) - blocked by a wall
- Left: (1, 4) - blocked by a wall
- Right: (3, 4) - blocked by a wall
- Diagonals: (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 3), (3, 5) - (3, 3) is the only empty space among these options

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the examination of the neighboring positions, the only possible move is to the position (3, 3), which is an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(3, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position (3, 3), we need to identify the possible moves. Since we can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position (up, down, left, right, or diagonally), we will examine the neighboring positions.

## Step 3: Examine the neighboring positions
Looking at the maze, the neighboring positions of (3, 3) are:
- Up: (3, 2) - blocked by a wall
- Down: (3, 4) - blocked by a wall
- Left: (2, 3)
- Right: (4, 3) - blocked by a wall
- Diagonals: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4) - (4, 2) is the only empty space among these options that is closer to the goal

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Based on the examination of the neighboring positions, the best possible move is to the position (4, 2), which is an empty space and closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 2)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces that form a general shape resembling a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor" with an additional small corridor branching off from it.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape but different layout
To create a new maze, we will maintain the same size (7x7) and ensure that the empty spaces form a similar L-shape or bent corridor. However, we will place the walls and empty spaces differently to create a distinct maze.

## Step 3: Define the walls and empty spaces for the new maze
New Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
New Empty: (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)

## Step 4: Define the player position and goal for the new maze
New Player Position: (2, 5)
New Goal: (4, 2)

The final answer is: 
(1) L-shape or bent corridor
(2) Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (4, 2)
