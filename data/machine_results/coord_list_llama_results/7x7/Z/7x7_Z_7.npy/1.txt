You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, given the constraints of this format, I'll describe the steps and reasoning rather than implementing the algorithm directly.

1. **Current Position**: The player is at (2, 4).
2. **Goal Position**: The goal is at (4, 2).
3. **Possible Moves**: From any given position, the possible moves are up, down, left, right, and diagonals, as long as the destination is an empty space.

Given the current position (2, 4) and the goal (4, 2), the optimal first move would be to move diagonally down and to the right if possible, or to move in a way that gets closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

**Next Move**: Since moving directly down and right is not possible due to the wall at (3, 5) and the goal is more to the right and down, a reasonable next move would be to move down to (3, 4), which is an empty space and gets closer to the goal.

**Coordinates of Next Move**: (3, 4)

This move avoids walls and moves closer to the goal, setting up for further moves that can navigate around the walls to reach the goal at (4, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Path:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "L-shape" or more specifically, a "bent corridor" that connects the player position to the goal position.

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces that form a similar L-shape or bent corridor:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (5, 6)

This new maze maintains the same size and shape characteristics as the original, with a bent corridor connecting the player position to the goal position. Note that the specific arrangement of walls and empty spaces is different from the original maze, but the overall shape of the path remains similar.
