You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move towards the goal position (1, 3) from the current player position (6, 0).

First, let's analyze the maze and the goal:

- The goal is at (1, 3), and we are starting from (6, 0).
- The most direct path would involve moving up and left, but we need to avoid walls and only move through empty spaces.

Given the constraints and the layout of the maze, a possible first move could be to move diagonally up and left from (6, 0) to (5, 1), as (5, 1) is an empty space and moving diagonally is allowed.

Therefore, my next move would be to (5, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the goal position (1, 3), my next move would aim to continue moving up and left towards the goal.

From the current position (5, 1), I notice that moving directly up to (4, 1) is not possible because (4, 1) is a wall. However, I can move diagonally up and left to (4, 0) is also not possible because (4, 0) is a wall, but I can move diagonally up and left to (4, 2) is not a good option since it would take me further away from the goal in the x-direction.

A better option is to move up to (4, 1) is not possible, so I will move left to (5, 0) is not possible because (5, 0) is a wall, but I can move up and left diagonally to (4, 0) is not possible because (4, 0) is a wall.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "Zigzag" or more specifically, a "Staircase" shape, with a series of connected, diagonal, and horizontal paths.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "Staircase" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 2), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (1, 3)

This new maze has a similar "Staircase" shape, with a series of connected, diagonal, and horizontal paths. The empty spaces form a recognizable staircase pattern, and there is a valid path from the player position (6, 6) to the goal position (1, 3) through the empty spaces.
