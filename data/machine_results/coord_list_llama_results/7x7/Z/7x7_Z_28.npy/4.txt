You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since I can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals), I will explore all possible moves from the current position.

The current player position is (3, 4). The possible moves from this position are:

* Up: (3, 3)
* Down: (3, 5)
* Left: (2, 4) (but this is a wall, so it's not a valid move)
* Right: (4, 4)
* Up-left: (2, 3) (but this is a wall, so it's not a valid move)
* Up-right: (4, 3)
* Down-left: (2, 5) (but this is a wall, so it's not a valid move)
* Down-right: (4, 5)

The valid moves are: (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), and (4, 5).

Since the goal is to reach (6, 4), I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. The move (4, 4) is a good choice, as it moves me one step to the right and keeps me on the same row as the goal.

My next move is: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 4), I will explore all possible moves again.

The possible moves from this position are:

* Up: (4, 3)
* Down: (4, 5) (but this is a wall, so it's not a valid move)
* Left: (3, 4) (but this is the previous position, so it's not a good move)
* Right: (5, 4) (but this is a wall, so it's not a valid move)
* Up-left: (3, 3)
* Up-right: (5, 3)
* Down-left: (3, 5)
* Down-right: (5, 5) (but this is a wall, so it's not a valid move)

The valid moves are: (4, 3), (3, 3), (5, 3), and (3, 5).

Since the goal is to reach (6, 4), I will choose the move that brings me closer to the goal. The move (5, 3) is a good choice, as it moves me one step to the right and keeps me relatively close to the goal.

My next move is: (5, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 3), I will explore all possible moves again.

The possible moves from this position are:

* Up: (5, 2) (but this is a wall, so it's not a valid move)
* Down: (5, 4) (but this is a wall, so it's not a valid move)
* Left: (4, 3)
* Right: (6, 3)
* Up-left: (4, 2)
* Up-right: (6, 2)
* Down-left: (4, 4)
* Down-right: (6, 4)

The valid moves are: (4, 3), (6, 3), (4, 4), (6, 2), and (6, 4).

Since the goal is to reach (6, 4), I will choose the move that brings me directly to the goal. The move (6, 4) is the best choice, as it moves me directly to the goal.

My next move is: (6, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (6, 4)

This new maze has a similar L-shape or bent corridor formed by the empty spaces, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The player can navigate from the starting position (3, 5) to the goal position (6, 4) through the empty spaces.
