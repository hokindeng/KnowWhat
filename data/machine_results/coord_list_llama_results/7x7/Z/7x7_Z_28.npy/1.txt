You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and given the constraints of the format, I'll describe the approach and provide the next move directly.

Given the current player position (3, 4) and the goal position (6, 4), and considering the maze's layout, the optimal path involves moving down and right, avoiding walls.

The next move should aim to get closer to the goal while navigating through empty spaces. Since the goal is directly below the current position and there are no walls blocking a direct path down, the best next move is to move down.

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, the next move should continue to navigate towards the goal position (6, 4) while avoiding walls.

Since the current position is (4, 4) and the goal is directly below, the best next move is to move down to (5, 4). However, (5, 4) is a wall. Therefore, we need to find an alternative path.

Considering the available empty spaces, moving right to (4, 5) is not possible because (4, 5) is a wall. Moving left to (4, 3) is also not possible because (4, 3) is a wall.

The next best option is to move down and then right, but since moving directly down is blocked by a wall at (5, 4), we should look for a diagonal move that gets us closer to the goal.

A viable move is to move diagonally down-right to (5, 5), but since (5, 5) is a wall, this move is not possible.

However, moving diagonally down-left to (5, 3) is possible since (5, 3) is an empty space.

Therefore, the next move is to (5, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, the next move should continue to navigate towards the goal position (6, 4) while avoiding walls.

Since the current position is (5, 3) and the goal is to the right and down, the best next move is to move down to (6, 3). This move is possible since (6, 3) is an empty space.

Therefore, the next move is to (6, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, the next move should navigate towards the goal position (6, 4) while avoiding walls.

Since the current position is (6, 3) and the goal is directly to the right, the best next move is to move right to (6, 4). This move is possible since (6, 4) is the goal position and there are no walls blocking this move.

Therefore, the next move is to (6, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (6, 4)

This new maze has the same L-shape or bent corridor shape as the original maze, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The path from P to G is still navigable through the empty spaces.
