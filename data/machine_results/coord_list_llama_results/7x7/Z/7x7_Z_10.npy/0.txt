You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move closer to the goal position (3, 2) from the current player position (1, 3).

First, let's analyze the maze and the goal:

- The goal is at (3, 2).
- The current position is at (1, 3).

Given the empty spaces and the goal, a direct path to the goal is not immediately apparent due to the walls. However, we can see that moving diagonally or in a straight line towards the goal while avoiding walls is the optimal strategy.

From (1, 3), moving directly to (3, 2) is not possible due to the walls. However, we can move towards the goal by navigating through the available empty spaces.

A possible next move could be to move diagonally or directly towards the goal, avoiding walls. Since we cannot move directly to the goal due to the walls, let's consider moving to a position that brings us closer to the goal.

Given the empty spaces, a reasonable next move could be to (2, 3), as it moves us closer to the goal and avoids walls. However, since (2, 3) is not directly mentioned in the list of empty spaces provided, and considering the constraints of movement, a safer approach would be to analyze the provided empty spaces more closely for a viable path.

Upon reevaluation, considering the empty spaces provided and aiming to move closer to the goal while avoiding walls, a viable next move could be to (1, 2), as it's an empty space and moves us in the general direction towards the goal, albeit not directly. This move also keeps us flexible for the next steps, considering the maze's layout and the goal's position.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the goal position (3, 2), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

From the current position (1, 2), we can see that moving directly to the goal is not possible due to the walls. However, we can move towards the goal by navigating through the available empty spaces.

A possible next move could be to move to (2, 3), as it moves us closer to the goal and avoids walls. This move also brings us closer to the goal's row.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the goal position (3, 2), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

From the current position (2, 3), we can see that moving directly to the goal is not possible due to the walls. However, we can move towards the goal by navigating through the available empty spaces.

A possible next move could be to move to (3, 2), but since it's not directly accessible due to the wall at (3, 3), we need to find an alternative route.

Considering the empty spaces, we can move to (4, 2), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal's column. From there, we can reassess the path to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (4, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (5, 6)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The empty spaces form an L-shape, similar to the original maze, but with a different orientation and position.
