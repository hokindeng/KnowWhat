You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or grid, such as this maze. However, since we're asked for a step-by-step solution and not the entire path at once, we'll adapt the BFS approach to find the next move.

Given the current player position (P) at (0, 4) and the goal position (G) at (3, 4), we'll start by exploring all possible moves from the current position.

### Step 1: Identify Possible Moves

From (0, 4), considering we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space, we look at the maze's layout:

- Up: (0, 3) is empty.
- Down: (0, 5) is empty.
- Left: Not possible due to the wall.
- Right: Not possible due to the wall.
- Diagonals: (1, 3) and (1, 5) are potential moves but require checking if they are empty and not blocked by walls.

Given the constraints and the maze's layout, the most direct move towards the goal while avoiding walls would be to move down to (0, 5), as it keeps us on a path that could potentially lead to the goal without immediately hitting a wall or requiring a diagonal move that might not be directly towards the goal.

### Next Move

Therefore, the next move would be to (0, 5).

Please update the maze with this new position, and I'll be happy to guide the next step.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze with the player position at (0, 5), we'll assess the possible moves again:

- Up: Not possible due to the wall at (0, 6).
- Down: Not possible due to the wall at (1, 5) and (0, 6) blocking direct downward movement.
- Left: Not possible due to the wall.
- Right: Possible to (1, 5) but it's a wall, so we look for diagonal moves.
- Diagonals: Moving diagonally to (1, 4) is a valid move since it's an empty space.

Considering the goal is at (3, 4), moving diagonally to (1, 4) aligns with moving towards the goal while avoiding walls.

### Next Move

Therefore, the next move would be to (1, 4).

Please update the maze with this new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze with the player position at (1, 4), we'll assess the possible moves again:

- Up: Not possible due to the wall at (1, 3).
- Down: Not possible due to the wall at (2, 4).
- Left: Not possible due to the wall.
- Right: Possible to (2, 4) but it's a wall, so we look for diagonal moves.
- Diagonals: Moving diagonally to (2, 3) is a valid move since it's an empty space.

Considering the goal is at (3, 4), moving diagonally to (2, 3) is a strategic move that keeps us on a path towards the goal while avoiding walls.

### Next Move

Therefore, the next move would be to (2, 3).

Please update the maze with this new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze with the player position at (2, 3), we'll assess the possible moves again:

- Up: Not possible due to the wall at (2, 2).
- Down: Not possible due to the wall at (2, 4).
- Left: Not possible due to the wall.
- Right: Possible to (3, 3) since it's an empty space.
- Diagonals: Moving diagonally to (3, 4) is a valid move since it's the goal position.

Considering the goal is at (3, 4), moving diagonally to (3, 4) is the most direct and efficient move.

### Next Move

Therefore, the next move would be to (3, 4).

Please update the maze with this new position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**(1) General Shape of the Path:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "L-shaped" or "Elbow-shaped" path. This is because the path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G) involves a turn, creating an "L" or "elbow" shape.

**(2) New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form an L-shaped path:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (0, 6)
Goal: (6, 6)

This new maze has an L-shaped path from the player position (P) at (0, 6) to the goal position (G) at (6, 6), while maintaining the same size and general shape as the original maze.
