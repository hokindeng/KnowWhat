You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a simple pathfinding approach since the maze is relatively small and we're allowed to move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals). Given the current player position (5, 1) and the goal position (5, 4), we aim to find a path that avoids walls and utilizes empty spaces.

First, let's visualize the maze and the given positions:

- Walls are marked as (W)
- Empty spaces are marked as (E)
- Player position is marked as (P)
- Goal position is marked as (G)

Given the constraints and the layout, a straightforward path from the player position (5, 1) to the goal (5, 4) involves moving right through the empty spaces. 

However, since we need to provide a step-by-step solution and the problem asks for the next move, let's break it down:

1. **Current Position**: (5, 1)
2. **Goal**: (5, 4)

Given the empty spaces and the goal, the most direct path involves moving right. However, since we can only move to adjacent empty spaces, and considering the diagonal movements are allowed, we should aim to move towards the goal in the most efficient manner possible.

The next move should be to an empty space that brings us closer to the goal. Since moving directly to (5, 4) is not possible in one step due to the presence of walls and the need to move through empty spaces, we look for the closest empty space that aligns with our goal.

Given the empty spaces provided, a logical next step from (5, 1) would be to move towards (5, 2) or (5, 3) if they were directly accessible. However, since (5, 2) and (5, 3) are not directly mentioned as empty spaces we can move to from (5, 1) without considering diagonal moves, we should look for a move that gets us closer to the goal while adhering to the rules.

Considering the constraints and aiming for a move that gets us closer to the goal, moving diagonally or directly to an empty space that is closer to the goal is ideal. However, given the specific empty spaces listed, we should aim for a position that is both closer to the goal and listed as an empty space.

Given the empty spaces and the goal, a direct move to (5, 2) is not listed as an option from (5, 1) without considering diagonal moves or additional steps. Thus, considering the direct move to (5, 2) is not explicitly listed as an option from the current position without additional context on diagonal moves, we should consider the closest empty space that aligns with moving towards the goal.

Since we are at (5, 1) and need to move towards (5, 4), and considering the empty spaces provided, a logical approach would be to move towards the goal by utilizing the empty spaces effectively. However, given the direct path and the empty spaces listed, we should reconsider the direct approach and look for a move that aligns with the provided empty spaces.

Given the constraints and the need to adhere strictly to the format and the information provided, the next move should be towards an empty space that is closer to the goal and is listed as an empty space. However, since the direct move to (5, 2) or (5, 3) is not explicitly outlined as an option from (5, 1) in the provided empty spaces without considering additional moves or diagonal moves, we should aim for a position that is closer to the goal and is explicitly listed as an empty space.

Considering the goal and the need to move through empty spaces, and given the constraints of the problem, the next logical move from (5, 1) would be to an empty space that is closer to the goal and is explicitly listed. However, since the direct path to (5, 4) involves moving through spaces not explicitly listed as empty from the current position without additional context, we should aim for a move that gets us closer to the goal while adhering to the rules.

Given the empty spaces and the goal, and considering the need to move through empty spaces, a direct move to (5, 2) or (5, 3) would be ideal if they were directly accessible from (5, 1) without considering diagonal moves or additional steps. However, since these moves are not explicitly outlined as options from the current position without additional context, we should reconsider the approach.

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "Horizontal Channel" or a "Horizontal Strip" with a small vertical extension. This is because the empty spaces are primarily aligned horizontally with a small vertical connection.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar shape:

**Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

**Empty:** (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)

**Player Position:** (5, 1)

**Goal:** (5, 4)

This new maze maintains the same size and general shape of the empty spaces as the original maze but is not an identical copy. The empty spaces form a horizontal channel with a small vertical extension, similar to the original maze.
