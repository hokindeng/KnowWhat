You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we can approach this by visually analyzing the maze and determining the shortest path to the goal.

First, let's visualize the maze based on the given information:

- Walls are represented by their coordinates.
- Empty spaces are where we can move.
- The player starts at (4, 2).
- The goal is at (5, 4).

Given the player's position at (4, 2) and the goal at (5, 4), and considering the walls and empty spaces, the most direct path while avoiding walls would be to move diagonally or in a way that gets us closer to the goal efficiently.

Since we can move diagonally, a direct approach to the goal seems feasible. However, we need to ensure we're not moving into a wall or a position that would block our path or require backtracking.

Given the constraints and the layout, a possible next move could be to move diagonally towards the goal. However, since we need to provide a step-by-step solution and the maze doesn't explicitly allow diagonal moves in its description (though it's implied by "any diagonal"), we'll plan a move that adheres strictly to the given instructions and avoids assuming diagonal moves are explicitly allowed.

A safe next move, considering we aim to get closer to the goal and avoid walls, would be to move right from (4, 2) to (4, 3), as (4, 3) is not listed as a wall and is an empty space according to the problem statement. This move keeps us on a path towards the goal without immediately moving into a wall or a blocked path.

Therefore, my next move would be to (4, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze appears to be a "L-shape" or more specifically, a "bent corridor" that connects the player's starting position to the goal, with a notable turn or bend in the path.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shape or bent corridor:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (5, 4)

This new maze maintains the same size and has a valid path from the player's starting position to the goal through empty spaces. The shape formed by the empty spaces is recognizable as an L-shape or bent corridor, similar to the original maze, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces.
