You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move towards the goal position (5, 4) from the current player position (4, 2).

First, let's analyze the maze and the goal:

- The goal is at (5, 4).
- The current position is at (4, 2).

Given the empty spaces and the goal, a direct path to the goal seems feasible. However, we need to navigate through the empty spaces efficiently.

A possible first move, considering we want to move closer to the goal and avoid walls, would be to move diagonally up and to the right, if possible, or otherwise move right and then up, depending on the availability of empty spaces.

Given the empty spaces listed, a direct diagonal move from (4, 2) to (5, 3) is not possible because (5, 3) is not listed as an empty space. However, moving right from (4, 2) to (4, 3) is not directly possible either because (4, 3) is a wall. 

But we can move up from (4, 2) to (4, 3) is not possible due to the wall, so let's consider moving right to an empty space that is closer to the goal. Since (4, 3) is a wall, we look for the next available move.

Considering the constraints and the layout, a viable first move would be to move right to (4, 4) is not possible due to the wall, so we look for the next available move. Moving up is not possible due to the wall at (4, 3), so we look for a move that gets us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

Given the empty spaces, moving diagonally or directly to the right is not immediately possible due to the walls. However, we can move up to (3, 2) is not possible due to the wall, so we look for the next available move.

A possible move is to move up to (3, 3) which is an empty space, but it's not directly closer to the goal. However, considering the maze layout, moving up to (3, 3) could be a strategic move to navigate around the walls and get closer to the goal in subsequent moves.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 3), aiming to navigate around the walls and find a path to the goal.

Please update the maze with my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and my new position at (3, 3), I'll analyze the possible moves to get closer to the goal at (5, 4).

Since I'm currently at (3, 3), and the goal is at (5, 4), I'll aim to move right and up to get closer to the goal.

However, moving directly right from (3, 3) to (4, 3) is not possible because (4, 3) is a wall.

Considering the empty spaces, I can move right to (4, 2) which is an empty space, but it's not directly closer to the goal. However, it's a possible move that could help me navigate around the walls.

But, I can also move up to (3, 4) is not possible due to the wall, so I look for the next available move.

A possible move is to move right to (4, 2) and then navigate from there.

However, I notice that moving right to (4, 2) would put me back in a position that's not closer to the goal. So, I need to think of a different strategy.

Let me re-evaluate the maze.

Ah-ha! I notice that moving down from (3, 3) to (4, 3) is not possible due to the wall, but moving down to (4, 2) is possible, and from there, I can try to navigate to the goal.

So, my next move would be to move down to (4, 2), aiming to navigate around the walls and get closer to the goal in subsequent moves.

Please update the maze with my new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and my new position at (4, 2), I'll analyze the possible moves to get closer to the goal at (5, 4).

Since I'm currently at (4, 2), and the goal is at (5, 4), I'll aim to move right and up to get closer to the goal.

However, moving directly right from (4, 2) to (5, 2) is possible, and from there, I can try to navigate up to the goal.

So, my next move would be to move right to (5, 2), aiming to get closer to the goal and navigate up from there.

Moving up from (5, 3) to (5, 4) is possible, and it would put me directly at the goal.

So, my next move would be to move up to (5, 4), aiming to reach the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (5, 4)

This new maze has a similar L-shape or bent corridor formed by the empty spaces, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The player can navigate from the starting position (0, 1) to the goal position (5, 4) through the empty spaces.
