You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move closer to the goal position (5, 4) from the current player position (4, 2).

First, let's analyze the maze and the goal:

- The goal is at (5, 4).
- The current position is at (4, 2).

Given the empty spaces and the goal, a direct path to the goal is not immediately clear due to the walls. However, we can see that moving diagonally or directly towards the goal while avoiding walls is the optimal strategy.

A possible first move, considering we want to get closer to the goal and avoid walls, is to move diagonally up and to the right, which would place us at (5, 3). This move is valid because (5, 3) is an empty space according to the provided information.

Therefore, my next move would be to (5, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (5, 3), the next move should aim to get closer to the goal at (5, 4).

Since the goal is directly to the right of the current position, and there are no walls blocking this path, the most straightforward move is to move right to (5, 4).

Therefore, my next move would be to (5, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze appears to be a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor". The empty spaces are primarily located along the top row and the rightmost column, with a few isolated spaces in the middle, forming a rough L-shape.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape characteristics:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (5, 6)

This new maze has a similar L-shape formed by the empty spaces, with a corridor along the top row and a vertical path along the rightmost column. The player starts at (4, 4) and needs to navigate to the goal at (5, 6) through the empty spaces.
