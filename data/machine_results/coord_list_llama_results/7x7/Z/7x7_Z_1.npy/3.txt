You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move closer to the goal position (6, 5) from the current player position (4, 4).

First, let's analyze the maze and the possible moves from the current position (4, 4):

- The walls block the top and left sides.
- The empty spaces below and to the right are accessible.

Given the goal is at (6, 5), the most direct approach would be to move down and then right, navigating through the empty spaces. However, since we can move diagonally, we should also consider diagonal moves that bring us closer to the goal.

From (4, 4), a possible next move could be to move diagonally down and to the right if possible, or simply down if a diagonal move is blocked by a wall or not available.

Looking at the maze, moving directly down from (4, 4) to (5, 4) is not possible because (5, 4) is a wall. However, moving diagonally down and to the right to (5, 5) is not directly possible due to the wall at (5, 5). The best immediate move, considering the goal and the layout, is to move down to the first available empty space below (4, 4) that is not blocked by a wall, which would be (5, 3) or finding a path that gets closer to the goal.

Given the constraints and aiming for a path that gets closer to the goal (6, 5), and considering the maze's layout, a reasonable next move would be to head towards the empty spaces that lead closer to the goal, avoiding walls.

However, upon reevaluation for a precise next step considering the maze's specifics and the ability to move diagonally:

A direct diagonal move from (4, 4) to (5, 5) is not possible due to the wall at (5, 5). The best approach is to navigate through the available empty spaces that lead towards the goal.

Given the layout, moving from (4, 4) to (5, 3) is a viable step as it moves closer to the goal and avoids walls. This move positions the player to potentially move further down and then right towards the goal in subsequent steps.

Therefore, the next move would be to (5, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 3), we need to navigate towards the goal (6, 5). Given the maze's layout and the available empty spaces, the next move should aim to get closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

Looking at the maze, moving directly right from (5, 3) is blocked by a wall at (5, 4) and (5, 5). However, we can move down to (6, 3), which is an empty space and gets us closer to the goal.

From (6, 3), we can then plan our next moves to reach the goal (6, 5), potentially moving right if the space is empty.

Therefore, the next move would be to (6, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6, 3), we are now on the same row as the goal (6, 5). The next move should aim to get closer to the goal by moving right.

Since the space to the right of (6, 3) is empty at (6, 4), we can move there. This move gets us closer to the goal and positions us for a potential final move to reach the goal.

Therefore, the next move would be to (6, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6, 4), we are now directly adjacent to the goal (6, 5). The next move should aim to reach the goal by moving right.

Since the space to the right of (6, 4) is the goal (6, 5), we can move there directly. This move will reach the goal and complete the maze.

Therefore, the next move would be to (6, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or more specifically, a "bent corridor" or "elbow shape". However, considering the overall layout and the path from the player to the goal, a more fitting description would be a "staircase" or "zigzag" shape, as the path navigates through a series of connected, angled corridors.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "staircase" or "zigzag" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Empty: (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (6, 6)

This new maze has a similar "staircase" or "zigzag" shape, with a path that navigates through a series of connected, angled corridors from the player to the goal.
