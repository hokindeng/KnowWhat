You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move towards the goal position (6, 5) from the current player position (4, 4).

First, let's analyze the maze and the goal:

- The goal is at (6, 5).
- The current position is at (4, 4).
- We need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

Given the empty spaces and the goal, a direct path to the goal seems feasible by moving down and right, avoiding walls. However, since we can move diagonally, we can potentially shorten the path.

A possible first move, considering we want to move towards the goal and have the option to move diagonally, would be to move down and right, directly towards the goal if possible, or to the nearest empty space that brings us closer to the goal.

Looking at the empty spaces provided, a direct diagonal move from (4, 4) to (5, 5) is not possible because (5, 5) is a wall. However, moving down to (5, 4) is not an option since (5, 4) is also a wall. The best initial move, considering the constraints and aiming to get closer to the goal, would be to move to an empty space that is closer to the goal and not blocked by walls.

Given the constraints and the layout, moving to (5, 3) is not directly possible from (4, 4) because it would require moving through a wall. However, we can move to (4, 5) which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (4, 5).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze appears to be a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor". The empty spaces are primarily located in a vertical column from (2, 2) to (2, 6) and then extend horizontally to the right from (2, 5) to (6, 5), with a few additional spaces scattered around.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 5)

This new maze has a similar L-shape formed by the empty spaces, but with some variations in the wall placement and additional empty spaces to create a new path from the player position to the goal.
