You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we need to navigate from the player position (0, 3) to the goal position (0, 1) while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces. Given the constraints and the maze layout, the optimal first move would be to move diagonally or directly towards the goal if possible, or to move in a way that opens up the most paths towards the goal.

Given the initial setup, the player is at (0, 3), and the goal is at (0, 1). However, there are walls and empty spaces that dictate our path. The most direct path to the goal from the player's position, considering the maze's layout, involves moving through the empty spaces in a way that avoids walls.

Since the goal is directly above the player but is blocked by walls, we need to find an alternative route. The empty spaces at (0, 2) and (1, 2) offer a potential path. However, given the player's current position at (0, 3) and the goal at (0, 1), and considering the maze's constraints, the best initial move would be to move to an empty space that brings us closer to the goal or opens up a path towards it.

Given the layout, moving to (0, 2) is not possible as it's not directly adjacent to the player's current position in a way that allows for a diagonal move in this context, and moving directly up is blocked by the wall at (1, 3) and other walls above it. Therefore, the best move considering the constraints and aiming to navigate towards the goal while avoiding walls would be to move to a position that sets us up for further progress.

However, upon reevaluation, considering the direct movement options (up, down, left, right, or diagonals) and the goal's position relative to the player, the optimal move is actually to move diagonally or directly towards the goal if possible. Given the walls and the current position, the direct path to the goal is blocked, but we can aim to get closer.

Given the constraints and the aim for clarity, the initial move should aim to utilize the available empty spaces effectively. Since the direct move to (0, 2) is not feasible due to the wall at (1, 3) and the need to navigate through empty spaces, and considering the diagonal and direct movement options, the best approach is to move towards the goal while navigating around the walls.

Upon careful consideration, the maze's layout suggests that the initial move should aim to position the player for a potential path towards the goal, considering the empty spaces and walls. However, the description provided initially overlooked the direct feasibility of moving towards the goal given the constraints.

Given the player's position at (0, 3) and the goal at (0, 1), with the walls and empty spaces as described, the most straightforward path involves navigating through the empty spaces in a manner that avoids the walls and moves towards the goal. The initial move should be towards (0, 2), but considering the need for a step-by-step solution and the constraints, the actual feasible move considering the maze's layout and the rules for movement (adjacent empty spaces) would be to move in a way that sets up for a path towards the goal.

However, the initial analysis overlooked the simplicity of the direct path due to the constraints provided. The correct approach, given the rules and the maze, involves moving directly towards the goal if possible or finding an alternative route through the empty spaces while avoiding walls.

Given the setup, the player is at (0, 3), and the goal is at (0, 1). The direct path is blocked by walls, but we can move towards the goal by navigating through the empty spaces. The initial move should be to (0, 2), considering the aim to move towards the goal and the constraints of the maze.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(0, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze, the player is now at (0, 2), and the goal is at (0, 1). The direct path to the goal is now clear, as there are no walls blocking the way.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(0, 1)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 4), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (6, 6)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-shape, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze.
