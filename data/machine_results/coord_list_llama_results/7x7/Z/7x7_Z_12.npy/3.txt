You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The current player position is (2, 3). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, but only to empty spaces. We need to examine the empty spaces and walls around the current position to determine the possible moves.

## Step 3: Examine the empty spaces and walls around the current position
The empty spaces around the current position are (2, 4), (2, 5), and (2, 6). There are no empty spaces directly above, below, to the left, or to the right of the current position. However, there is an empty space at (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), and (5, 6), but these are not directly adjacent to the current position.

## Step 4: Determine the best possible move
Since the goal position is (3, 5), we need to move towards it. The closest empty space to the current position that is also closer to the goal is (2, 4).

## Step 5: Choose the next move
The next move should be to the empty space (2, 4), which is one step to the right of the current position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The current player position is (2, 4). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, but only to empty spaces. We need to examine the empty spaces and walls around the current position to determine the possible moves.

## Step 3: Examine the empty spaces and walls around the current position
The empty spaces around the current position are (2, 3), (2, 5), and (2, 6). There are no empty spaces directly above or below the current position. However, there is an empty space at (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), and (5, 6), but these are not directly adjacent to the current position.

## Step 4: Determine the best possible move
Since the goal position is (3, 5), we need to move towards it. The closest empty space to the current position that is also closer to the goal is not directly available. However, moving to (2, 5) would bring us closer to the goal and potentially allow us to move towards it in the next step.

## Step 5: Choose the next move
The next move should be to the empty space (2, 5), which is one step to the right of the current position.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)

Goal: (3, 5)

The current player position is (2, 5). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, but only to empty spaces. We need to examine the empty spaces and walls around the current position to determine the possible moves.

## Step 3: Examine the empty spaces and walls around the current position
The empty spaces around the current position are (2, 3), (2, 4), and (2, 6). However, since the goal position is (3, 5), we should try to move towards it. Unfortunately, there is no direct empty space to the right of the current position that would bring us closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Determine the best possible move
Since we cannot move directly towards the goal, we should try to move to a position that would allow us to move towards the goal in the next step. Moving down to (3, 5) is not possible because there is a wall at (3, 4) and (3, 3) and (3, 2) and (3, 1) and (3, 0) and the space (3, 5) is not adjacent to (2, 5). However, moving to (5, 5) is not possible because there is no empty space that would allow us to move diagonally to (5, 5). However, moving to (5, 4) is possible if we move diagonally down-right to (3, 6) then down to (4, 6) then left to (4, 5) then left to (4, 4) then down to (5, 4) but this is not the shortest path.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze.
The original maze has empty spaces that form a shape resembling a "L" or a "bent corridor" with a small extension at the top.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape of empty spaces.
To create a new maze with the same shape of empty spaces, we need to design a maze that has a similar "L" or "bent corridor" shape with a small extension at the top.

## Step 3: Determine the coordinates of the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position in the new maze.
The new maze will have the same size as the original maze, with 7 rows and 7 columns. The coordinates of the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position will be determined to form the desired shape.

## Step 4: Encode the new maze using the same format as the original.
The new maze will be encoded using the same format as the original, with lists of coordinates for the walls, empty spaces, player position, and goal position.

The final answer is: 

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "bent corridor" or "L" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape of empty spaces:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (6, 0)
