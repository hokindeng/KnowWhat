You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (2, 3), we need to identify the adjacent empty spaces where the player can move. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or any diagonal, but only to empty spaces.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the nearest empty space to the goal
Since the goal is at (3, 5), we should prioritize moving towards that direction. However, we must avoid walls and only move through empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the next move based on the analysis
From the current position (2, 3), the nearest empty space that moves us closer to the goal (3, 5) without hitting a wall is (2, 4), as it is directly to the right and is an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze after the last move
The player has moved to (2, 4), and we need to reassess the maze to find the next move towards the goal (3, 5).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From (2, 4), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the nearest empty space to the goal
Since the goal is at (3, 5), we should prioritize moving towards that direction. However, we must avoid walls and only move through empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the next move based on the analysis
From the current position (2, 4), the nearest empty space that moves us closer to the goal (3, 5) without hitting a wall is (2, 5), as it is directly to the right and is an empty space.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(2, 5)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Reassess the maze after the last move
The player has moved to (2, 5), and we need to reassess the maze to find the next move towards the goal (3, 5).

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
From (2, 5), we can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the maze to find the nearest empty space to the goal
Since the goal is at (3, 5), we should prioritize moving towards that direction. However, we must avoid walls and only move through empty spaces.

## Step 4: Determine the next move based on the analysis
From the current position (2, 5), the nearest empty space that moves us closer to the goal (3, 5) without hitting a wall is not directly available. However, we can move down to (3, 5) but it is blocked by a wall. The alternative is to move down to (3, 4) is not possible, but we can move to (3, 6) is not possible, but we can move to (4, 5) is not possible, but we can move to (5, 5) is possible or move to (2, 6) is possible or move to (2, 4) is possible.

## Step 5: Choose the best move
Considering the options, moving to (5, 5) is the best option as it moves us closer to the goal and does not hit a wall.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 5)}$

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces that form a shape resembling a "L" or a "bent corridor" with an additional isolated section.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze with the same shape, we will maintain the same size (7x7) and ensure that the empty spaces form a similar "L" or "bent corridor" shape.

## Step 3: Design the new maze
Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (5, 6)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L}$
