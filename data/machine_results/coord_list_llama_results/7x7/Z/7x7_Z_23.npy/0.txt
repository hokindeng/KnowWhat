You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and given the constraints of the format, I'll describe the approach and provide the first move.

Given the player's position at (3, 2) and the goal at (6, 1), we need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

1. **Current Position**: (3, 2)
2. **Goal**: (6, 1)
3. **Empty Spaces**: (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)

**First Move**:
Given the current position and the available empty spaces, the best first move would be to move diagonally or directly to an empty space that brings us closer to the goal. Since moving diagonally is allowed and it's the most efficient way to cover more ground, we'll aim to move diagonally towards the goal.

However, since we need to follow the format strictly and provide a single answer, and considering the constraints of the maze and the goal's position, a direct move to an adjacent empty space that aligns with the goal's direction seems most appropriate.

**Next Move**: (3, 3)

This move keeps us aligned with the goal's column and prepares us for further diagonal or direct moves towards the goal, depending on the updated maze configuration after this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze configuration, we'll continue to navigate towards the goal.

**Current Position**: (3, 3)
**Goal**: (6, 1)
**Empty Spaces**: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)

To move closer to the goal, we should aim to move down and to the right, considering the available empty spaces.

**Next Move**: (4, 3)

This move takes us closer to the goal's row and keeps us aligned with the available empty spaces, preparing us for further moves towards the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze configuration, we'll continue to navigate towards the goal.

**Current Position**: (4, 3)
**Goal**: (6, 1)
**Empty Spaces**: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)

Since we're already at row 4, we should aim to move down to row 5 or 6, considering the available empty spaces. However, moving directly to row 6 might not be possible due to the wall at (6, 5) and (6, 6). Therefore, we'll move to row 5, which has an empty space at (5, 2).

**Next Move**: (5, 2)

This move takes us closer to the goal's row and prepares us for further moves towards the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze configuration, we'll continue to navigate towards the goal.

**Current Position**: (5, 2)
**Goal**: (6, 1)
**Empty Spaces**: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)

Since we're already at column 2, we should aim to move down to row 6, considering the available empty spaces. We can move directly to row 6, as there is an empty space at (6, 2).

**Next Move**: (6, 2)

This move takes us closer to the goal's position and prepares us for the final move towards the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze configuration, we'll make the final move towards the goal.

**Current Position**: (6, 2)
**Goal**: (6, 1)
**Empty Spaces**: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)

Since we're already at row 6, we can move left to column 1, which is the goal's position.

**Next Move**: (6, 1)

This move takes us directly to the goal, completing the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Path:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or a "Right-Angled Path".

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (6, 4)

This new maze has the same size as the original and forms a recognizable L-shape or Right-Angled Path with its empty spaces. The path from P to G can be reached through the empty spaces, and the maze is not an identical copy of the original.
