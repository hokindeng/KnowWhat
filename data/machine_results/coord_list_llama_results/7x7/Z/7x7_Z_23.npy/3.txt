You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The current player position is (3, 2). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, and diagonals. However, we need to check which of these moves are valid by ensuring the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, the possible moves from (3, 2) are:
- Up: (2, 2) is a wall, so this move is not valid.
- Down: (4, 2) is an empty space, so this move is valid.
- Left: (3, 1) is an empty space, so this move is valid.
- Right: (3, 3) is an empty space, so this move is valid.
- Diagonals: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), and (4, 3) are the possible diagonal moves. However, (2, 1) and (2, 3) are walls, and (4, 1) is a wall. Only (4, 3) is an empty space, making it a valid move.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the valid moves, we need to choose the one that brings us closer to the goal (6, 1) while avoiding walls. Moving down to (4, 2) or diagonally to (4, 3) are both valid options, but moving diagonally to (4, 3) seems to bring us closer to the goal in terms of both horizontal and vertical distance.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(4, 3)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The current player position is (4, 3). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, and diagonals. However, we need to check which of these moves are valid by ensuring the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, the possible moves from (4, 3) are:
- Up: (3, 3) is an empty space, so this move is valid.
- Down: (5, 3) is a wall, so this move is not valid.
- Left: (4, 2) is a wall, so this move is not valid.
- Right: (4, 4) is a wall, so this move is not valid.
- Diagonals: (3, 2), (3, 4), (5, 2), and (5, 4) are the possible diagonal moves. However, (5, 2) is the only valid diagonal move as (5, 4) is a wall and (3, 2) and (3, 4) are not closer to the goal.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the valid moves, we need to choose the one that brings us closer to the goal (6, 1) while avoiding walls. Moving up to (3, 3) or diagonally to (5, 2) are both valid options, but moving diagonally to (5, 2) seems to bring us closer to the goal in terms of both horizontal distance.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(5, 2)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position by moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current player position
The current player position is (5, 2). The possible moves from this position are up, down, left, right, and diagonals. However, we need to check which of these moves are valid by ensuring the destination is an empty space.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves
Looking at the maze, the possible moves from (5, 2) are:
- Up: (4, 2) is not a valid move since we are trying to move closer to the goal.
- Down: (6, 2) is an empty space, so this move is valid.
- Left: (5, 1) is a wall, so this move is not valid.
- Right: (5, 3) is a wall, so this move is not valid.
- Diagonals: (4, 1), (4, 3), (6, 1), and (6, 3) are the possible diagonal moves. However, (6, 1) is the goal and a valid diagonal move.

## Step 4: Choose the next move
Considering the valid moves, we need to choose the one that brings us closer to the goal (6, 1) while avoiding walls. Moving down to (6, 2) or diagonally to (6, 1) are both valid options, but moving diagonally to (6, 1) directly reaches the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(6, 1)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces that form a shape resembling a diagonal line with a small vertical extension, but more accurately, it can be described as a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape due to the diagonal and vertical movements required to navigate through the maze.

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same shape but different layout
To create a new maze with the same shape, we need to ensure that the empty spaces form a similar zigzag or staircase pattern. We will place the player position (P) and the goal position (G) in a way that requires a similar navigation path.

## Step 3: Design the new maze
Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 1)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (6, 1)

The final answer is: $\boxed{zigzag}$
