You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move towards the goal in the most direct way possible while avoiding walls.

First, let's analyze the maze and the goal:

- The player starts at (6, 0).
- The goal is at (3, 3).

Given the layout of the maze and the rules for movement, the most direct path to the goal from the starting position involves moving up and to the left, navigating through the empty spaces.

1. **Initial Move**: From (6, 0), the first move should be to (5, 1), as it's the most direct path towards the goal that avoids walls and utilizes the available empty spaces.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: **(5, 1)**.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (5, 1), the next move should continue to navigate towards the goal at (3, 3) while avoiding walls and utilizing the available empty spaces.

Since the goal is to the left and slightly up from the current position, and considering the layout of the maze, the most direct path involves moving up and to the left.

2. **Next Move**: From (5, 1), the next move should be to (4, 2), as it's a step closer to the goal and avoids the walls.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: **(4, 2)**.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (4, 2), the next move should continue to navigate towards the goal at (3, 3) while avoiding walls and utilizing the available empty spaces.

Since the goal is to the left and slightly up from the current position, and considering the layout of the maze, the most direct path involves moving left.

3. **Next Move**: From (4, 2), the next move should be to (3, 2), as it's a step closer to the goal and avoids the walls.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: **(3, 2)**.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (3, 2), the next move should navigate towards the goal at (3, 3) while avoiding walls and utilizing the available empty spaces.

Since the goal is directly above the current position, the most direct path involves moving up.

4. **Next Move**: From (3, 2), the next move should be to (3, 3), as it's the goal position.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: **(3, 3)**.

This move should reach the goal, solving the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Path:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "L-shaped" or "Elbow-shaped" path. This is because the path from the starting position to the goal position involves a sharp turn, resembling the shape of an "L" or an elbow.

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shaped or Elbow-shaped path:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (3, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-shaped or Elbow-shaped path, similar to the original maze.
