You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since I can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals), I will explore all possible moves from the current position.

The current player position is (6, 0), and the goal is (3, 3). I will start by exploring the adjacent empty spaces.

The adjacent empty spaces to (6, 0) are (6, 1) and (5, 1).

My next move will be to (6, 1), as it is one of the closest empty spaces to the current position.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will proceed with the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6, 1), I will explore the adjacent empty spaces.

The adjacent empty spaces to (6, 1) are (6, 0), (6, 2), (5, 1), and (6, 3) (diagonally).

However, since I just moved from (6, 0) to (6, 1), I will not move back to (6, 0). I will also not move to (6, 3) as it is not the most direct path to the goal.

My next move will be to (5, 1), as it is one of the closest empty spaces to the current position and moves me closer to the goal.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will proceed with the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 1), I will explore the adjacent empty spaces.

The adjacent empty spaces to (5, 1) are (6, 1), (4, 2), and (6, 2) (diagonally), and (5, 0) and (6, 0) are also adjacent but are not the most direct path to the goal.

However, since I just moved from (6, 1) to (5, 1), I will not move back to (6, 1). I will also not move to (6, 2) as it is not the most direct path to the goal.

My next move will be to (4, 2), as it is one of the closest empty spaces to the current position and moves me closer to the goal.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will proceed with the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 2), I will explore the adjacent empty spaces.

The adjacent empty spaces to (4, 2) are (3, 2), (5, 1), and (4, 1) is a wall, so I will not consider it.

My next move will be to (3, 2), as it is one of the closest empty spaces to the current position and moves me closer to the goal.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will proceed with the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 2), I will explore the adjacent empty spaces.

The adjacent empty spaces to (3, 2) are (3, 1), (3, 0), and (4, 2).

However, since (3, 3) is the goal, I will try to move closer to it. Unfortunately, (3, 3) is a wall, but I can move to a position that is closer to the goal.

My next move will be to (3, 1), as it is one of the closest empty spaces to the current position and moves me closer to the goal.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will proceed with the next move.

Note: I will try to find an alternative path to the goal, as the direct path is blocked by a wall.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 1), I will explore the adjacent empty spaces.

The adjacent empty spaces to (3, 1) are (3, 0) and (3, 2).

However, since (3, 3) is the goal, I will try to move closer to it. Unfortunately, (3, 3) is a wall, but I can move to a position that is closer to the goal.

My next move will be to (3, 2), as it is one of the closest empty spaces to the current position and moves me closer to the goal.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will proceed with the next move.

Note: I will try to find an alternative path to the goal, as the direct path is blocked by a wall.

Also, I will keep in mind that I can move diagonally, so I will explore those options as well.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 2), I will explore the adjacent empty spaces.

Unfortunately, I am stuck at this position, as the goal (3, 3) is a wall, and there are no other empty spaces adjacent to (3, 2) that I can move to.

However, I can try to move diagonally to a position that is closer to the goal. Unfortunately, there are no diagonal moves that can help me reach the goal.

It seems that I have reached a dead end, and I need to backtrack to find an alternative path to the goal.

My next move will be to (3, 1), as it is the previous position I was in, and I can try to find an alternative path from there.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will proceed with the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 1), I will explore the adjacent empty spaces.

The adjacent empty spaces to (3, 1) are (3, 0) and (3, 2).

However, I have already tried moving to (3, 2) and it led to a dead end. So, I will try moving to (3, 0) instead.

My next move will be to (3, 0), as it is one of the closest empty spaces to the current position.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will proceed with the next move.

Note: I will try to find an alternative path to the goal from this new position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 0), I will explore the adjacent empty spaces.

The adjacent empty spaces to (3, 0) are (3, 1) and (3, 2).

However, I have already tried moving to (3, 2) and it led to a dead end. So, I will try moving to (3, 1) instead.

My next move will be to (3, 1), as it is one of the closest empty spaces to the current position.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will proceed with the next move.

Note: I will try to find an alternative path to the goal from this new position.

Also, I will keep in mind that I can move diagonally, so I will explore those options as well.

Wait, I have an idea. Since I can move diagonally, I can try moving from (3, 0) to (4, 1) or (2, 1) if they are empty. Let me check the maze.

 Ah, I see that (4, 1) is a wall, but (4, 2) is empty. I can try moving to (4, 2) diagonally.

My next move will be to (4, 2), as it is one of the closest empty spaces to the current position and moves me closer to the goal.

Please update the maze to reflect my new position, and I will proceed with the next move.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

This new maze has the same size as the original maze and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an L-shape.
