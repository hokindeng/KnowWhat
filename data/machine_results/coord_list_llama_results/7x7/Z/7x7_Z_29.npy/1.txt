You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move towards the goal in the most direct way possible while avoiding walls.

First, let's analyze the maze and the goal:

- The player starts at (6, 0).
- The goal is at (3, 3).
- The maze has several walls that block direct paths, but there are empty spaces that can be used to navigate around these walls.

Given the current position and the goal, the most direct path would involve moving up and to the left. However, we need to navigate around the walls. Let's consider the empty spaces and the walls to find a viable path.

A possible first move, considering the need to move up and to the left while avoiding walls, would be to move diagonally up and to the left if possible, or to move in a way that sets up for such a move in subsequent steps.

Looking at the empty spaces and the walls, a good first move from (6, 0) would be to move to (5, 1), as it is an empty space that moves us closer to the goal and avoids the walls.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (5, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (5, 1), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 3) while avoiding walls.

Looking at the empty spaces and the walls, a good next move would be to move to (4, 2), as it is an empty space that moves us closer to the goal and avoids the walls. This move also sets us up for potential future moves that could bring us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (4, 2), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 3) while avoiding walls.

Looking at the empty spaces and the walls, a good next move would be to move to (3, 2), as it is an empty space that moves us closer to the goal and avoids the walls. This move also sets us up for a potential future move to the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (3, 2), we are now very close to the goal at (3, 3).

Since the goal is directly to the right of our current position, and there are no walls blocking the way, a good next move would be to move to (3, 3), which is the goal itself.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: (3, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 3), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (3, 3)

Note that this new maze has a similar L-shape formed by the empty spaces, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The path from P to G can be reached through the empty spaces, and the maze meets the required criteria.
