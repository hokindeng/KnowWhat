You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and given the constraints of the format, I'll describe the approach and provide the next move directly.

Given the maze's structure and the rules for movement (up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space), we aim to find the shortest path from the player's position (0, 3) to the goal (0, 5).

First, let's analyze the starting position and the goal:

- The player starts at (0, 3).
- The goal is at (0, 5).

Given the walls and empty spaces, the most direct path to the goal from the starting position would involve moving through the empty spaces. Since the goal is directly above the starting position and there are no walls blocking the vertical path, the most straightforward move would be to move up.

However, considering the constraints and the need to follow the instructions precisely, let's break down the approach:

1. **Identify Possible Moves**: From (0, 3), possible moves are up, down, left, right, and diagonals. However, given the goal's position, moving up is the most direct approach.
   
2. **Check for Walls and Empty Spaces**: The space directly above (0, 3) is (0, 4), which is listed as an empty space.

3. **Determine the Next Move**: Given the direct path to the goal and the absence of walls in the immediate vertical path, the next logical move is to move up to (0, 4).

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, let's analyze the current situation:

- The player is now at (0, 4).
- The goal is at (0, 5), which is directly above the current position.

Since the goal is immediately above the current position and there are no walls blocking the vertical path, the most direct and logical move is to move up to (0, 5), which is the goal position.

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces as a "L-shaped corridor with a vertical extension".

Here is a new maze that meets the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (4, 6)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces is recognizable as an "L-shaped corridor with a vertical extension", similar to the original maze.
