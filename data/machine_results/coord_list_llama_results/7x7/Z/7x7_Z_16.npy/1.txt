You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move towards the goal position (0, 5) from the current player position (0, 3).

First, let's analyze the maze and the goal:

- The goal is at (0, 5).
- The current position is at (0, 3).
- The direct path to the goal is blocked by walls at (1, 3) and (1, 4), but there's an empty space at (1, 5) which is directly above the goal.

Given the constraints and the layout, a logical first move would be to move diagonally up and to the right towards the empty space that is closest to the goal and not blocked by walls. However, since we can only move to adjacent empty spaces and the description doesn't explicitly allow diagonal moves in the initial problem statement (though it's mentioned in the context), we'll proceed with a move that adheres to the problem's constraints as initially stated, focusing on moving right since moving up directly is blocked.

The closest empty space to the right of the current position (0, 3) that is not blocked by walls and is on the path towards the goal would be (0, 4), as (0, 5) is directly blocked by a wall at (1, 4) and moving diagonally isn't explicitly allowed in the initial move based on the problem's constraints.

Therefore, the next move would be to (0, 4).

Please update the maze to reflect this move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, we're now at position (0, 4) and our goal is to reach (0, 5). Since we can move to any adjacent empty space, and the goal is directly to the right of our current position, we can move right to reach the goal.

Therefore, the next move would be to (0, 5).

This move should put us directly at the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze appears to be a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor". The path starts from the left side, moves horizontally, and then turns upwards to reach the goal.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape, but with a different configuration:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 6)

This new maze has the same L-shape or bent corridor shape as the original, but with a different configuration of walls and empty spaces. The path from the player position to the goal is still valid and can be reached through the empty spaces.
