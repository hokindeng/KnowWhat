You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and given the constraints of the format, I'll describe the approach and provide the first move directly.

Given the player's position at (0, 3) and the goal at (0, 5), and considering the maze's layout, the direct path to the goal is blocked by walls. Thus, we need to navigate around these obstacles.

1. **Initial Assessment**: The player is at (0, 3), and the goal is at (0, 5). However, there's a wall at (0, 4) blocking the direct path.

2. **First Move**: Since we cannot move directly to the goal due to the wall at (0, 4), we look for an alternative path. Given the empty spaces, a viable first move is to move diagonally or directly to an empty space that brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls. However, since diagonal moves are allowed and there's an empty space at (1, 5), a strategic move would be to aim towards the empty spaces that could potentially lead us around the walls and closer to the goal.

Given the constraints and the aim to move closer to the goal while navigating around walls, a logical first move, considering the empty spaces provided, would be to move towards (1, 5) or find a path that utilizes the empty spaces effectively to navigate around the walls. However, since (1, 5) is directly accessible and brings us closer to the goal's y-coordinate, it's a good starting point.

**First Move Coordinates**: (1, 5)

This move is chosen because it utilizes the diagonal movement option to bypass the wall at (0, 4) and positions the player closer to the goal's y-coordinate, setting up for further navigation around the maze's walls.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems there was a mistake in the previous move's outcome. The player's position was supposed to be at (1, 5) after the move, but it's currently at (0, 4). Let's correct this and proceed with the correct position.

Assuming the correct position after the first move is indeed (1, 5), we'll reassess the maze. However, since the current state shows the player at (0, 4), we'll work with this position to provide the next move.

Given the player's current position at (0, 4) and the goal at (0, 5), the direct path is now clear.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (0, 5)

This move is chosen because it directly moves the player to the goal position, which is now accessible without any walls blocking the path.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Path:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "L-shaped" or "Elbow-shaped" path. This is because the path from the player's position to the goal forms a distinct L-shape, navigating around the walls.

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shaped path:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (5, 6)

This new maze has a similar L-shaped path from the player's position to the goal, navigating around the walls. Note that the specific arrangement of walls and empty spaces is different from the original maze, but the overall shape of the path remains the same.
