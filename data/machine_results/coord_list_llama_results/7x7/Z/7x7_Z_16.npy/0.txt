You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or maze. However, given the constraints of the problem and the need to provide a step-by-step solution, we'll adapt this approach to manually navigate through the maze.

First, let's visualize the maze based on the given information:

- Walls are represented by their coordinates.
- Empty spaces (path) are also represented by their coordinates.
- The player's current position is (0, 3).
- The goal position is (0, 5).

Given the player's current position (0, 3) and the goal (0, 5), and considering the maze's layout, the most direct path to the goal while avoiding walls would be to move right from the current position.

However, since we need to provide a step-by-step solution and the maze's layout is not visually provided, we'll analyze the possible moves based on the given coordinates:

1. **Current Position**: (0, 3)
2. **Goal**: (0, 5)

Since the goal is directly to the right of the current position and there are no walls between them according to the provided empty spaces, the next logical move would be to move right towards the goal.

**Next Move**: (0, 4)

This move is chosen because it moves the player closer to the goal while avoiding walls and staying within the empty spaces provided.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated state of the maze, we can see that the player has successfully moved to (0, 4). The goal is now just one step to the right at (0, 5).

Since there are no walls between the current position (0, 4) and the goal (0, 5), and the space at (0, 5) is considered an empty space (path), the next logical move would be to move right again towards the goal.

**Next Move**: (0, 5)

This move should place the player at the goal position, successfully completing the navigation through the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Original Maze's Path:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "L-shaped" or "Elbow-shaped" path. This is because the path from the player's starting position to the goal forms a distinct L-shape, with a vertical segment followed by a horizontal segment.

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shaped path:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (6, 6)

This new maze has a similar L-shaped path, but with a different configuration of walls and empty spaces. The path from the player's starting position to the goal forms a distinct L-shape, with a vertical segment followed by a horizontal segment.
