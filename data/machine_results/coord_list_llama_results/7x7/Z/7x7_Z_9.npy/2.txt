You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (2, 2) to the goal position (2, 0) while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces. Given the constraints and the layout of the maze, we can start by examining the possible moves from the current position.

The current position is (2, 2), and the goal is directly above it at (2, 0). However, there are walls and empty spaces that need to be navigated around. The most direct path to the goal, considering the maze's layout, involves moving diagonally or horizontally/vertically through empty spaces.

Given the maze's layout, a possible first move could be to move diagonally or directly to an adjacent empty space that brings us closer to the goal. Since the goal is above us and there's an empty space at (2, 1), we can consider moving there as a first step.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After re-examining the maze, I notice that the goal position (2, 0) is now directly below me. However, there is a wall at (2, 0), which means I need to find an alternative route.

Since I'm currently at (2, 1) and the goal is blocked by a wall, I'll look for a way to move around the wall. I can see that there's an empty space at (3, 2) and also at (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), and (5, 3), but moving to those positions would take me further away from the goal.

A possible move could be to try to find a path that allows me to move around the wall and get closer to the goal. However, given the current layout, it seems that I need to move to a position that will eventually allow me to move left or right to bypass the wall.

Considering the available options, I'll move to (3, 2), which is an adjacent empty space. This move will give me more options to navigate around the wall and potentially find a path to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After re-examining the maze, I notice that I'm currently at (3, 2) and the goal is still at (2, 0). Since I moved to (3, 2) to try to find a path around the wall, I now need to consider my next move.

Looking at the available empty spaces, I see that moving to (2, 2) or (2, 3) would bring me closer to the goal. However, I also notice that moving to (2, 1) would put me in a better position to potentially move left or right to bypass the wall.

Considering the available options, I'll move to (2, 1), which is an adjacent empty space. This move will give me more options to navigate around the wall and potentially find a path to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm back at (2, 1) and the goal is still at (2, 0). Since I've tried moving around the wall and ended up back at (2, 1), I'll take a closer look at the goal position.

I notice that the goal position (2, 0) is directly below me, but it's blocked by a wall. However, I also see that there's no wall at (2, 1) and (2, 0) is the only position that's blocked.

Considering the available options, I'll try to move to the goal position (2, 0) directly. Since there's no wall at (2, 1) and the goal is directly below, I'll attempt to move down.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

After analyzing the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

This new maze has a similar L-shape formed by the empty spaces, but with a different configuration and a new path from the player position to the goal.
