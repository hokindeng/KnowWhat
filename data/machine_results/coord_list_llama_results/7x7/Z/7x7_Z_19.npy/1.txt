You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or maze. Given the player's position and the goal, we'll explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) from the current position, avoiding walls and keeping track of visited positions to avoid loops.

Given the player's current position is (4, 6) and the goal is (1, 5), let's start by identifying the possible moves from (4, 6).

Possible moves from (4, 6) considering the maze constraints:
- Up: (3, 6) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
- Down: Not applicable since we're already at the bottom row in terms of the player's position.
- Left: (4, 5) - This is an empty space.
- Right: Not applicable since moving right would put us out of the maze's bounds.
- Diagonals: 
  - Up-left: (3, 5) - This is an empty space.
  - Up-right: Not applicable due to the wall at (3, 6).
  - Down-left: Not applicable since we're already at the bottom row.
  - Down-right: Not applicable since moving right would put us out of the maze's bounds.

Given these options, the best next moves would be either (4, 5) or (3, 5), as both are valid moves into empty spaces. However, since our goal is to reach (1, 5) and considering the maze's layout, moving diagonally up-left to (3, 5) seems more promising as it moves us closer to the goal position while also opening up more potential paths.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 5).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze appears to be a "L-shape" or more specifically, a "bent corridor" that connects the player's starting position to the goal.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shape or bent corridor:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (1, 5)

This new maze maintains the same size and has a valid path from the player's starting position to the goal, while forming a similar L-shape or bent corridor with its empty spaces.
