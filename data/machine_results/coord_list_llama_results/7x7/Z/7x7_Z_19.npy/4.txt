You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to find a path from the player position (4,6) to the goal (1,5).

First, let's analyze the maze and the possible moves from the current player position (4,6). The player can move to any empty space that is adjacent. Given the walls and empty spaces provided, the player's initial possible moves are limited due to the surrounding walls and the position of empty spaces.

The player position is (4,6), and the goal is (1,5). The direct path is blocked by walls, so we need to navigate around them. Looking at the empty spaces, a potential path could involve moving towards the empty spaces that are closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

Given the empty spaces and the goal, a reasonable first move from (4,6) could be to move diagonally up-left to (3,5), as it moves closer to the goal and avoids walls. However, since (3,5) is not listed as an empty space, we must reconsider based on the provided empty spaces.

A viable first move, considering the constraints and aiming to move closer to the goal, would be to move to (4,5), as it is an empty space and moves in the general direction of the goal. This move also keeps the player positioned to potentially move further left or up in subsequent moves, depending on the updated maze.

Therefore, my next move would be to (4,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, we'll continue to navigate towards the goal (1,5) from the current player position (4,5).

Analyzing the empty spaces and the walls, a direct leftward move is not possible due to the walls at (3,5) and (3,6). However, we can see that there is an empty space at (3,4), which is diagonally up-left from the current position.

Considering the available empty spaces and the goal, a reasonable next move would be to move diagonally up-left to (3,4). This move brings the player closer to the goal and avoids walls.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, we'll continue to navigate towards the goal (1,5) from the current player position (3,4).

Analyzing the empty spaces and the walls, we can see that there is an empty space at (2,5), which is diagonally up-left from the current position. This move would bring the player closer to the goal.

Considering the available empty spaces and the goal, a reasonable next move would be to move diagonally up-left to (2,5). This move avoids walls and moves in the general direction of the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze, we'll continue to navigate towards the goal (1,5) from the current player position (2,5).

Analyzing the empty spaces and the walls, we can see that the goal (1,5) is directly to the left of the current position. Since there are no walls blocking the direct leftward move, we can move to the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1,5), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "staircase" shape, but more specifically, it resembles a "L-shaped" or "elbow" shape with a diagonal extension.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape characteristics:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (1, 5)

This new maze has a similar L-shaped or elbow shape with a diagonal extension, but it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The empty spaces form a valid path from the player position to the goal.
