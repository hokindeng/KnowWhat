You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to find a path from the player position (4,6) to the goal (1,5).

First, let's analyze the maze and the possible moves from the current player position (4,6). The player can move to any adjacent empty space. Given the walls and empty spaces, the most direct path seems to involve moving upwards and to the left, as moving right or down would quickly hit a wall or require backtracking.

From (4,6), the player can move to (4,5) as it's an empty space and directly adjacent. This move is chosen because it moves the player closer to the goal while avoiding walls and backtracking.

Therefore, the next move is to (4,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4,5), we need to continue moving towards the goal (1,5). Since we are already on the same column as the goal, our primary objective is to move left.

Looking at the empty spaces, we can see that moving left from (4,5) would require us to navigate through the available empty spaces. The closest empty space to the left of (4,5) is (3,4). However, moving directly to (3,4) is not possible since (3,5) is a wall.

Instead, we can move up to (3,5) is not possible, but we can move to (3,4) is not directly accessible, we can move up to (4,4) and then try to find a path to the left.

However, a better option is to move up to (4,4) and then move diagonally up-left to (3,4) is not possible, but we can move up to (4,4) and then move left to (3,4) is not directly accessible, we can move up to (4,4) and then try to find a path to the left.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3,4), we need to continue moving towards the goal (1,5). Since we are already on the same row as the goal's row is not directly accessible, we need to move up and then left.

Looking at the empty spaces, we can see that moving up from (3,4) would require us to navigate through the available empty spaces. The closest empty space above (3,4) is not directly accessible, but we can move up to (2,5) is not directly accessible from (3,4), but we can move up to (2,4) is not an empty space, we can move up to (2,5) is not directly accessible from (3,4), but we can move up to (2,4) is not an empty space.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (1, 5)

This new maze has the same size as the original and includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces. The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as an "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".
