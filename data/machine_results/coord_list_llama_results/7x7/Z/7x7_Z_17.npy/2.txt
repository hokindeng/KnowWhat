You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a pathfinding algorithm. Given the constraints and the ability to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space, we'll aim to move towards the goal position (4, 3) from the current player position (1, 2) while avoiding walls.

First, let's analyze the maze and the goal:

- The goal is at (4, 3).
- The player starts at (1, 2).

Given the maze's layout and the rules for movement, a direct path to the goal is not immediately apparent due to the presence of walls. However, we can see that moving down and to the right is generally the direction we need to head in to reach the goal.

Looking at the empty spaces and the walls, a potential first move could be to move down to (2, 2), but since (2, 2) is a wall, we cannot move there directly. Instead, we should look for an adjacent empty space that moves us closer to the goal.

A viable first move is to (1, 3), which is an empty space and moves us closer to the goal by being one step to the right. This move also sets us up for potential future moves that could navigate around the walls and towards the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (1, 3), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 3) while avoiding walls.

Looking at the available empty spaces, a potential next move could be to move down to (2, 3), but since (2, 3) is a wall, we cannot move there directly. However, we can see that (2, 5) is an empty space, but moving there would take us away from the goal.

A better option is to move to (1, 4), which is an empty space and moves us closer to the goal by being one step to the right. This move also sets us up for potential future moves that could navigate around the walls and towards the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (1, 4), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 3) while avoiding walls.

Looking at the available empty spaces, a potential next move could be to move down to (2, 4), but since (2, 4) is a wall, we cannot move there directly. However, we can see that (2, 5) is an empty space, and moving there would allow us to navigate around the walls.

A viable next move is to (2, 5), which is an empty space and moves us closer to the goal by being one step down and to the right. This move also sets us up for potential future moves that could navigate around the walls and towards the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (2, 5).

Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (2, 5), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 3) while avoiding walls.

Looking at the available empty spaces, a potential next move could be to move down to (3, 5), but since (3, 5) is a wall, we cannot move there directly. However, we can see that (3, 4) is an empty space, and moving there would allow us to navigate around the walls.

A viable next move is to (3, 4), which is an empty space and moves us closer to the goal by being one step down and to the left. This move also sets us up for potential future moves that could navigate around the walls and towards the goal.

Therefore, my next move would be to (3, 4).

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (3, 4), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 3) while avoiding walls.

Looking at the available empty spaces, a potential next move could be to move down to (4, 4), but since (4, 4) is a wall, we cannot move there directly. However, we can see that there is no direct path to the goal, and we need to navigate around the walls.

A viable next move is to move down and to the left to (4, 3), but since we cannot move directly to the goal, we need to find an alternative path. However, I notice that there is no wall at (4, 3) that would prevent us from moving there. 

Therefore, my next move would be to (4, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or "staircase" shape, with a series of connected L-shapes that allow the player to navigate from the starting position to the goal.

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 5)

This new maze has the same zigzag or staircase shape as the original, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The player can navigate from the starting position to the goal by following the connected L-shapes formed by the empty spaces.
