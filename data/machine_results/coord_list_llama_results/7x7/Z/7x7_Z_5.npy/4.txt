You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or maze. However, since we're asked for a step-by-step solution and not the entire path at once, we'll adapt the approach to find the next move towards the goal.

Given the current player position (5, 5) and the goal (1, 5), we aim to move closer to the goal while avoiding walls and staying on empty spaces.

1. **Identify Possible Moves**: From the current position (5, 5), we can potentially move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

2. **Analyze Adjacent Spaces**:
   - Up: (4, 5) is a wall.
   - Down: (6, 5) is a wall.
   - Left: (5, 4) is an empty space.
   - Right: (5, 6) is an empty space.
   - Diagonals: (4, 4), (4, 6), (6, 4), and (6, 6) are either walls or out of bounds.

3. **Choose the Next Move**: Since moving directly up or down is blocked by walls, and moving right doesn't bring us closer to the goal, the best move is to the left, to (5, 4), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: **(5, 4)**.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze and the current player position (5, 4), we'll analyze the possible moves to get closer to the goal (1, 5).

1. **Identify Possible Moves**: From the current position (5, 4), we can potentially move up, down, left, right, or diagonally to any adjacent empty space.

2. **Analyze Adjacent Spaces**:
   - Up: (4, 4) is a wall.
   - Down: (6, 4) is a wall.
   - Left: (5, 3) is an empty space.
   - Right: (5, 5) is an empty space, but moving right doesn't bring us closer to the goal.
   - Diagonals: (4, 3) is an empty space, (4, 5) is a wall, (6, 3) is out of bounds, and (6, 5) is a wall.

3. **Choose the Next Move**: Since moving directly up or down is blocked by walls, and moving right doesn't bring us closer to the goal, the best move is to the left, to (5, 3), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal. Alternatively, moving diagonally to (4, 3) is also a viable option, but moving left is a more direct approach.

Therefore, the coordinates of my next move are: **(5, 3)**.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Based on the original maze, I would describe the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) as a "L-shaped" or "Elbow-shaped" path.

Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar L-shaped path:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (1, 5)

This new maze has a similar L-shaped path, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The path from P to G is still valid and can be reached through the empty spaces.
