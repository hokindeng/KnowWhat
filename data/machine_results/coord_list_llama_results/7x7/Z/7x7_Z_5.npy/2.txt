You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or grid, such as this maze. However, given the constraints of the problem and the format requested, I'll describe the approach and provide the next move directly.

### Approach:

1. **Identify Possible Moves**: From any given position, identify all possible moves (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) that do not result in hitting a wall or moving outside the maze boundaries.
2. **BFS Exploration**: Explore the maze level by level, starting from the player's position, and mark each visited position to avoid revisiting it.
3. **Goal Detection**: Stop the exploration once the goal position is reached.

### Next Move:

Given the player's current position is (5, 5) and the goal is (1, 5), we aim to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. The most direct path would involve moving up and left. However, we must consider the maze's layout and the positions of the walls.

A possible next move, considering the need to navigate around walls and towards the goal, would be to move diagonally up-left if possible, or otherwise choose the best available direction that brings us closer to the goal without hitting a wall.

Given the constraints and the need for a step-by-step solution, the immediate next move from (5, 5) would logically be to move up, as moving directly left is blocked by a wall, and diagonal moves are not always possible given the wall layout.

Therefore, the next move would be to (5, 4), as it moves us closer to the goal and avoids hitting a wall.

**Next Move Coordinates:** (5, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current state of the maze and the player's position at (5, 4), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 5) while avoiding walls.

Looking at the maze, moving directly left from (5, 4) is not possible due to the presence of walls. However, we can move up to (5, 3) or diagonally up-left if possible. Since diagonal moves are not always guaranteed due to the wall layout, the safest next move would be to move up to (5, 3), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

**Next Move Coordinates:** (5, 3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "Zigzag" or "Winding Path".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar zigzag or winding path shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (1, 5)

This new maze has a similar zigzag or winding path shape, but with a different arrangement of walls and empty spaces. The path from P to G is still valid and can be reached through the empty spaces.
