You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, since the problem asks for a step-by-step solution and given the constraints of the format, I'll describe the approach and provide the first move.

Given the player's position at (5, 5) and the goal at (1, 5), we aim to move towards the goal while avoiding walls and staying within the empty spaces.

1. **Identify Possible Moves**: From (5, 5), we can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) to an adjacent empty space.

2. **Choose the Next Move**: Since our goal is at (1, 5), which is to the left and slightly up from our current position, we should prioritize moves that bring us closer to the goal in a generally leftward direction.

Given the empty spaces and the goal's position, a reasonable next move from (5, 5) would be to move diagonally up and left to (4, 4), as it brings us closer to the goal and avoids walls.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (4, 4)

This move is chosen because it:
- Is an empty space.
- Avoids walls.
- Moves closer to the goal in a diagonal direction, which is efficient given the maze's layout.

Please update the maze with this new position, and I'll be happy to guide the next step based on the updated maze.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

**1. General Shape of the Original Maze's Path:**
The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a **"Zigzag"** or more specifically, a **"Staircase"** shape, given the diagonal and horizontal movements required to navigate from the player's position to the goal.

**2. New Maze with the Same Shape:**
Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7), with empty spaces that form a similar "Staircase" shape. Note that this maze is not an identical copy of the original and includes a valid path from P to G.

**Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

**Empty:** (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2)

**Player Position:** (5, 5)
**Goal:** (1, 5)

This new maze maintains the "Staircase" shape of the empty spaces, allowing for a diagonal and horizontal path from the player's position to the goal, while avoiding walls.
