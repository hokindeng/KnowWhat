You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since I can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and four diagonals), I will explore all possible moves from the current position.

The current player position is (5, 3). I will explore all adjacent empty spaces.

Possible moves:
- Up: (4, 3) is a wall, so I cannot move up.
- Down: (6, 3) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (5, 2) is an empty space.
- Right: (5, 4) is an empty space.
- Up-left: (4, 2) is an empty space.
- Up-right: (4, 4) is a wall, so I cannot move up-right.
- Down-left: (6, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move down-left.
- Down-right: (6, 4) is a wall, so I cannot move down-right.

Since the goal is to reach (0, 2), I will prioritize moving up and left. My next move will be to (5, 2), which is an empty space and brings me closer to the goal.

Next move: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I will explore all possible moves from the current position (5, 2).

Possible moves:
- Up: (4, 2) is an empty space.
- Down: (6, 2) is a wall, so I cannot move down.
- Left: (5, 1) is an empty space.
- Right: (5, 3) is an empty space, but I just came from there, so I won't move back.
- Up-left: (4, 1) is an empty space.
- Up-right: (4, 3) is a wall, so I cannot move up-right.
- Down-left: (6, 1) is a wall, so I cannot move down-left.
- Down-right: (6, 3) is a wall, so I cannot move down-right.

Since the goal is to reach (0, 2), I will prioritize moving up and left. My next move will be to (4, 2), which is an empty space and brings me closer to the goal.

Next move: (4, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "zigzag" or a "winding path".

(2) Here is a new maze with the same size and shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (0, 6)

This new maze has a winding path that is similar to the original maze, but with a different layout. The empty spaces form a zigzag shape that allows the player to navigate from the starting position to the goal.
