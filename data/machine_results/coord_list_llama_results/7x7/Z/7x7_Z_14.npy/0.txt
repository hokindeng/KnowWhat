You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve this maze, we will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. However, given the constraints of the problem and the format requested, I'll describe the approach and provide the next move directly.

1. **Understanding the Maze**: The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a player position (P), and a goal position (G). The player can move in any of the eight directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) to an adjacent empty space.

2. **BFS Approach**: BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph or grid, which is the case here. The algorithm explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

3. **Next Move**: Given the player's current position is (2, 3) and the goal is (0, 5), we need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. The direct path to the goal is blocked by walls, so we need to navigate around them.

Given the constraints and the need to provide a direct answer:

The next move should be towards the empty space that brings us closer to the goal while avoiding walls. Since the goal is at (0, 5) and we are at (2, 3), moving up and to the left is a good strategy. However, we must avoid the walls.

A possible next move is to (1, 4), as it moves us closer to the goal and avoids the walls. This move is chosen based on the need to navigate around the walls and move towards the goal position.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the updated maze state, we need to continue moving towards the goal (0, 5) from the current position (1, 4).

Since the goal is directly above and to the left, but there's a wall at (1, 5), we can't move directly up. However, we can move up to the empty space at (0, 4) and then try to navigate to the goal from there.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We are now at (0, 4) and the goal is at (0, 5). However, there's a wall at (0, 6) and also at (1, 5) which blocks the direct path to the goal.

Since we can't move directly up to the goal due to the wall at (1, 5) and also can't move up to (0, 5) because it's not an empty space, we need to find an alternative route.

We can move to the left to (0, 3) and then try to navigate to the goal from there.

**Next Move Coordinates**: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

However, we can move up to (0, 5) is not possible, but we can move to the left to (0, 3) and then try to navigate to the goal from there, or we can move to the right to (1, 4) and then try to navigate to the goal from there.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "L-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same L-shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
