You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the maze layout and the objective
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (2, 3), we need to identify all possible adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, and diagonals.

## Step 3: List the adjacent coordinates
The adjacent coordinates to (2, 3) are:
- Up: (2, 2)
- Down: (2, 4)
- Left: (1, 3)
- Right: (3, 3)
- Diagonals: (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)

## Step 4: Filter out the wall coordinates
From the given list of walls, we need to exclude any coordinates that are walls.

## Step 5: Identify the valid moves
After filtering out the walls, we identify the valid moves. From the given list of empty spaces, we can see that (1, 4), (3, 2), and (2, 4) are empty spaces.

## Step 6: Choose the next move
Since the goal is to reach (0, 5), we should prioritize moving upwards and to the left. Among the valid moves, (1, 4) is the most suitable as it moves us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(1, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (1, 4), we need to identify all possible adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, and diagonals.

## Step 3: List the adjacent coordinates
The adjacent coordinates to (1, 4) are:
- Up: (1, 3)
- Down: (1, 5)
- Left: (0, 4)
- Right: (2, 4)
- Diagonals: (0, 3), (0, 5), (2, 3), (2, 5)

## Step 4: Filter out the wall coordinates
From the given list of walls, we need to exclude any coordinates that are walls.

## Step 5: Identify the valid moves
After filtering out the walls, we identify the valid moves. From the given list of empty spaces, we can see that (0, 4), (0, 3), and (2, 3) are empty spaces.

## Step 6: Choose the next move
Since the goal is to reach (0, 5), we should prioritize moving upwards and to the left. Among the valid moves, (0, 4) is the most suitable as it moves us closer to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(0, 4)}$

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.## Step 1: Understand the current state of the maze
The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position (P), and a goal position (G). The objective is to navigate from the current player position to the goal position while avoiding walls and moving only through empty spaces.

## Step 2: Identify the possible moves from the current position
Given the current player position is (0, 4), we need to identify all possible adjacent empty spaces. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, and diagonals.

## Step 3: List the adjacent coordinates
The adjacent coordinates to (0, 4) are:
- Up: (0, 3)
- Down: (0, 5)
- Left: Not applicable since we are at the leftmost edge
- Right: (1, 4)
- Diagonals: Not applicable since we are at the leftmost edge

## Step 4: Filter out the wall coordinates
From the given list of walls, we need to exclude any coordinates that are walls.

## Step 5: Identify the valid moves
After filtering out the walls, we identify the valid moves. From the given list of empty spaces, we can see that (0, 3) and (1, 4) are empty spaces. However, since our goal is to reach (0, 5), we should prioritize moving down.

## Step 6: Choose the next move
Since the goal is to reach (0, 5) and it is an adjacent empty space, we can move directly to the goal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{(0, 5)}$

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

## Step 1: Identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze
The original maze has empty spaces that form a general shape resembling a "L-shape" or a "bent corridor".

## Step 2: Create a new maze with the same size and shape
To create a new maze, we will maintain the same size (7x7) and ensure that the empty spaces form a similar L-shape or bent corridor. We will also include a valid path from P to G.

## Step 3: Define the new maze
Here is the new maze:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 6)

The final answer is: $\boxed{L-shape}$
