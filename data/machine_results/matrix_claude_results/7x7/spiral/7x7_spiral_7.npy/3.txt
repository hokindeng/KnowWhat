You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 P 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,3)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,5)
3. We need to move through empty spaces (0) to reach G

Looking at the available moves from the current position (4,3):
- Up: blocked by wall (1)
- Down: blocked by wall (1)
- Left: empty space (0)
- Right: empty space (0)

Since we need to eventually reach the goal which is to the bottom right, and we have an empty space to the right, moving right would be the logical choice to get closer to the goal.

I choose to move right, to position (4,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 P 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,4)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,5)
3. We need to continue moving towards the goal

Looking at the available moves from current position (4,4):
- Up: blocked by wall (1)
- Down: blocked by wall (1)
- Left: empty space (0)
- Right: empty space (0)

Since the goal is to the bottom right and we have an empty space to the right, moving right would continue to get us closer to the goal.

I choose to move right, to position (4,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 P 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,5)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,5)
3. We need to continue moving towards the goal

Looking at the available moves from current position (4,5):
- Up: blocked by wall (1)
- Down: blocked by wall (1)
- Left: empty space (0)
- Right: empty space (0)

Since the goal (G) is directly below us but we can't move down due to a wall, we need to find another path. Looking at the maze, we can see that we need to go around through the left side of the maze to reach the bottom row.

I choose to move left, to position (4,4) to begin our path around to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 P 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0

- Up: blocked by wall (1)
- Down: blocked by wall (1)
- Left: empty space (0)

To reach the goal, we need to go around through the left side of the maze. This means we need to continue moving left until we can go down to the bottom row.

I choose to move left, to position (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

2. The goal (G) is at position (6,5)
3. We need to continue moving towards the left side to find a path down

Looking at the available moves from current position (4,3):
- Up: blocked by wall (1)
- Down: blocked by wall (1)
- Left: empty space (0)
- Right: empty space (0)

To reach the goal, we need to continue moving left until we can access the path that leads to the bottom row.

I choose to move left, to position (4,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 P 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0

1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape. The path requires going left, down, and then right to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze with the same U-shaped corridor pattern:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 P 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms a U-shaped corridor
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
- Requires the same basic strategy: go left, down, then right to reach the goal
