You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 P 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,3)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,5)
3. We need to move through empty spaces (0) to reach the goal

Looking at the available moves from the current position (4,3):
- Up: blocked by wall (1)
- Down: blocked by wall (1)
- Left: empty space (0)
- Right: empty space (0)

Since we need to eventually reach the goal which is to the bottom-right, and we have an empty space to the right, moving right would be the logical choice to get closer to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (4,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 P 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,4)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,5)
3. We need to continue moving towards the goal

Looking at the available moves from current position (4,4):
- Up: blocked by wall (1)
- Down: blocked by wall (1)
- Left: empty space (0)
- Right: empty space (0)

Since the goal is to the bottom-right and we have an empty space to the right, moving right continues to be the best choice to get closer to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (4,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 P 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,5)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,5)
3. We need to continue moving towards the goal

Looking at the available moves from current position (4,5):
- Up: blocked by wall (1)
- Down: blocked by wall (1)
- Left: empty space (0)
- Right: empty space (0)

Since the goal (G) is directly below our position but we can't move down due to a wall, we need to find another path. Looking at the maze, we can see that we need to go around through the left side of the maze to reach the goal.

First, let's move right to position (4,6), which will allow us to then move down and around through the available path.

I choose to move to coordinates (4,6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 P
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,6)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,5)
3. We need to find a path around to the goal

Looking at the available moves from current position (4,6):
- Up: empty space (0)
- Down: blocked by wall (1)
- Left: empty space (0)
- Right: blocked by wall (1)

Since we can't move directly down to the goal due to the wall, we need to backtrack and take the longer path around through the left side of the maze. Looking at the overall maze structure, we can see that we need to go back left and then find a path around through the bottom.

Let's start by moving left.

I choose to move to coordinates (4,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 P 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,5)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,5)
3. We need to continue finding a path around to the goal

Looking at the available moves from current position (4,5):
- Up: blocked by wall (1)
- Down: blocked by wall (1)
- Left: empty space (0)
- Right: empty space (0)

We need to continue moving left to access the path that will lead us around to the goal. This path will eventually let us go down through the left side of the maze and then back right to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (4,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 P 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,4)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,5)
3. We need to continue moving towards the left side path

Looking at the available moves from current position (4,4):
- Up: blocked by wall (1)
- Down: blocked by wall (1)
- Left: empty space (0)
- Right: empty space (0)

We need to continue moving left to reach the open path on the left side of the maze, which will allow us to go down and then back right to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,3)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,5)
3. We need to continue moving towards the left side path

Looking at the available moves from current position (4,3):
- Up: blocked by wall (1)
- Down: blocked by wall (1)
- Left: empty space (0)
- Right: empty space (0)

We should continue moving left to reach the open corridor on the left side of the maze, which will allow us to go down and then navigate back right to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (4,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 P 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0

(1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape. The path requires going left, down, and then right to reach the goal, tracing a U-shaped corridor.

(2) Here's a new maze with a similar U-shaped path:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 G 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a valid U-shaped path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze
- Maintains the U-shape pattern where the player must go right, down, and then left to reach the goal
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for paths, P for player, G for goal)
