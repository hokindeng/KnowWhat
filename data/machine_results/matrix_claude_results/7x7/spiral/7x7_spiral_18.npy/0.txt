You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (0,3)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (3,3)
3. I need to find a path from P to G while avoiding walls (1's)
4. Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to go down through the available path

The most efficient path would be to move down through the empty spaces (0's) to reach the goal.

For my first move, I want to move down from (0,3) to (1,3), but I notice there's a wall there (1). 
Looking at the available options:
- Up: blocked by edge
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: empty space
- Right: empty space

I'll move left to (0,2) as part of the path to eventually reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (0,2)
2. The goal 'G' is still at (3,3)
3. I need to find a way down to reach the goal

Looking at my available moves:
- Up: blocked by edge
- Down: blocked by wall (1)
- Left: empty space (0)
- Right: empty space (0)

I'll continue moving left to (0,1) as this will allow me to eventually go down through the clear path on the left side of the maze, which I can see leads toward the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (0,1)
2. The goal 'G' is still at (3,3)
3. I can see a clear path down along the left side of the maze

Looking at my available moves:
- Up: blocked by edge
- Down: empty space (0)
- Left: blocked by wall (1)
- Right: empty space (0)

I'll move down to (1,1) as this begins the path that will lead me toward the goal. This is part of the clear passage on the left side of the maze that will eventually allow me to reach the goal position.

My next move coordinates are: (1,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

3. I need to continue along the left path

Looking at my available moves:
- Up: empty space (0)
- Down: empty space (0)
- Left: blocked by wall (1)
- Right: blocked by wall (1)

I'll move down to (2,1) as this continues along the clear path on the left side of the maze that will eventually let me reach the goal position.

My next move coordinates are: (2,1)

Looking at my available moves:
- Up: empty space (0)
- Down: empty space (0)
- Left: blocked by wall (1)
- Right: blocked by wall (1)

I'll move down to (3,1) as this continues along the clear path that will let me reach the goal position. After this, I should be able to move right to reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (3,1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (3,1)

3. I'm on the same row as the goal

Looking at my available moves:
- Up: empty space (0)
- Down: empty space (0)
- Left: blocked by wall (1)
- Right: blocked by wall (1)

Since I'm now on the same row as the goal but separated by a wall, I need to continue down and find a path around. I'll move down to (4,1) to continue the path that will eventually let me reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (4,1)

Looking at my available moves:
- Up: empty space (0)
- Down: blocked by wall (1)
- Left: blocked by wall (1)
- Right: blocked by wall (1)

I need to go back up to (3,1) since I've reached a dead end at the bottom. Moving down further won't help me reach the goal. Going back up will allow me to try a different approach.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

1. The empty spaces (corridors) form a "U" shape. There's a vertical path down the left side, a horizontal path along the bottom, and a vertical path up the right side, forming a U-shaped corridor system.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a U-shaped corridor pattern but with a slightly different implementation:

1 P 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 G 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Maintains the U-shape corridor pattern
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze
- Has the same dimensions (7x7)
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for paths, P for start, G for goal)
- The U-shape is still clearly recognizable but with slightly wider corridors in some areas
