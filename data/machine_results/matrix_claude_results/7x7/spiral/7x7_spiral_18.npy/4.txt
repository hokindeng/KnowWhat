You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (0,3)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (3,3)
3. I need to find a path from P to G while avoiding walls (1's)
4. Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to go down through the available path

The most efficient path would be to move down through the empty spaces (0's) to reach the goal.

For my first move, I want to move down from (0,3) to (1,3), but I notice there's a wall there (1). 
Looking at the available options:
- Up: blocked by edge
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: empty space
- Right: empty space

I'll move left to (0,2) as part of the path to eventually reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (0,2)
2. The goal 'G' is still at (3,3)
3. I need to find a way down to reach the goal

Looking at my available moves:
- Up: blocked by edge
- Down: blocked by wall (1)
- Left: empty space (0)
- Right: empty space (0)

I'll continue moving left to (0,1) as this will allow me to eventually go down through the clear path on the left side of the maze, which I can see leads toward the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (0,1)
2. The goal 'G' is still at (3,3)
3. I can see a clear path down along the left side of the maze

Looking at my available moves:
- Up: blocked by edge
- Down: empty space (0)
- Left: blocked by wall (1)
- Right: empty space (0)

Now I can start moving down through the clear path on the left side. This will eventually allow me to move right towards the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (1,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (1,1)
2. The goal 'G' is still at (3,3)
3. I need to continue down the left side path

Looking at my available moves:
- Up: empty space (0)
- Down: empty space (0)
- Left: blocked by wall (1)
- Right: blocked by wall (1)

I'll continue moving down along the left side of the maze, as this is the clear path that will eventually let me reach the goal.

3. I need to move right to reach the goal

Looking at my available moves:
- Up: empty space (0)
- Down: empty space (0)
- Left: blocked by wall (1)
- Right: blocked by wall (1)

I notice that I'm now on the same row as the goal, but I can't move directly right because there's a wall. I need to go down one more step and then find a path around to reach the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 P 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape, with two vertical corridors connected by a horizontal corridor at the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with a U-shaped path:

1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms a U shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze
- Maintains the same basic concept of having to go down one side, across, and up the other side to reach the goal
