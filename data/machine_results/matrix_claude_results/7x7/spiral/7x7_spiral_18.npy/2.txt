You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (0,3)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (3,3)
3. I need to find a path from P to G while avoiding walls (1's)
4. Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to go down through the available path

The most efficient path would be to move down through the empty spaces (0's) to reach the goal.

For my first move, I want to move down from (0,3) to (1,3), but I notice there's a wall there (1). 

Looking at the available options from position (0,3):
- Up: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: possible (0)
- Right: possible (0)

I'll move left to position (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:

1. I am now at position (0,2)
2. The goal 'G' is still at (3,3)
3. I can see that I need to find a path down to reach the goal

From my current position (0,2), my options are:
- Up: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: blocked by wall (1)
- Left: possible (0)
- Right: possible (0)

Looking at the overall maze structure, I can see that there's a clear path down along the left side of the maze that will eventually let me reach the goal. Therefore, I should move left to access that path.

I'll move left to position (0,1).

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:

1. I am now at position (0,1)
2. The goal 'G' is still at (3,3)
3. I can now see that I can access the vertical path that leads down

From my current position (0,1), my options are:
- Up: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: possible (0)
- Left: blocked by wall (1)
- Right: possible (0)

Since I want to reach the goal at (3,3), and I can see there's a clear path down and then right to the goal, I should move down.

I'll move down to position (1,1).

My next move coordinates are: (1,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 P 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:

1. I am now at position (1,1)
2. The goal 'G' is still at (3,3)
3. I need to continue following the path down along the left side

From my current position (1,1), my options are:
- Up: possible (0)
- Down: possible (0)
- Left: blocked by wall (1)
- Right: blocked by wall (1)

Since I want to reach the goal at (3,3), I should continue moving down along the clear path on the left side of the maze.

I'll move down to position (2,1).

My next move coordinates are: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 P 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:

1. I am now at position (2,1)
2. The goal 'G' is still at (3,3)
3. I should continue following the path down along the left side

From my current position (2,1), my options are:
- Up: possible (0)
- Down: possible (0)
- Left: blocked by wall (1)
- Right: blocked by wall (1)

Continuing with the strategy of moving down along the left path to eventually reach the goal.

I'll move down to position (3,1).

My next move coordinates are: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1

1 P 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:

1. I am now at position (3,1)
2. The goal 'G' is at (3,3), which is two spaces to my right
3. I'm now at the same row as the goal

From my current position (3,1), my options are:
- Up: possible (0)
- Down: possible (0)
- Left: blocked by wall (1)
- Right: blocked by wall (1)

I notice that I can't move directly right to the goal because there's a wall at (3,2). I need to go down first, then right, and then back up to reach the goal.

I'll move down to position (4,1).

My next move coordinates are: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:

1. I am now at position (4,1)
2. The goal 'G' is at (3,3)
3. Now I can move right through the open path and then up to the goal

From my current position (4,1), my options are:
- Up: possible (0)
- Down: blocked by wall (1)
- Left: blocked by wall (1)
- Right: possible (0)

Since I can now access the path that leads to the goal, I should move right.

I'll move right to position (4,2).

My next move coordinates are: (4,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 P 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape. There's a vertical corridor on the left side, a vertical corridor on the right side, and a horizontal corridor at the bottom connecting them.

2) Here's a new maze with the same U-shape pattern but with P and G in different positions:

1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 G 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Maintains the U-shape corridor pattern
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze
- Places P and G in new positions while ensuring they're still connected by the U-shaped path
