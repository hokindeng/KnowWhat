You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 1 0 1 1
P 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. Player position (P) is at (5,0)
2. Goal position (G) is at (2,0)
3. We need to move upward to reach the goal
4. There is a clear path up along the leftmost column

Given this analysis, the best next move would be to move up one position from (5,0) to (4,0).

I choose coordinates: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 1 0 1 1
P 1 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving upward along the leftmost column since it provides a clear path to the goal.

Current position: (4,0)
Goal position: (2,0)

The best next move is to move up one position from (4,0) to (3,0).

I choose coordinates: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 0 1 1
P 1 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now just one step away from the goal.

Current position: (3,0)
Goal position: (2,0)

The best next move is to move up one position from (3,0) to (2,0), which will reach the goal.

I choose coordinates: (2,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape, with one vertical corridor along the left side and one horizontal corridor along the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
P 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the "L" is along the right side
- The horizontal part of the "L" is still along a bottom row
- There's a valid path from P to G
- The shape is still recognizably an "L"
- The maze has different wall placements while maintaining the same general structure
- The size remains 7x7
