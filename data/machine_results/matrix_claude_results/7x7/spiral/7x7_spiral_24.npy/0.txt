You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

Current position (P) is at (4,6)
Goal position (G) is at (0,2)

To reach the goal, I need to move up through the empty spaces (0s) while avoiding walls (1s).

Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to:
1. Move left from my current position
2. Continue moving left and then up through the corridor
3. Finally move right to reach G

For my first move, I'll move left from (4,6) to (4,5).

My next move coordinates are: (4,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving left through the empty corridor.

Current position is at (4,5)
Goal position (G) is at (0,2)

I'll move from (4,5) to (4,4).

My next move coordinates are: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving left through the empty corridor.

Current position is at (4,4)
Goal position (G) is at (0,2)

I'll move from (4,4) to (4,3).

My next move coordinates are: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've reached the vertical corridor, I'll start moving up.

Current position is at (4,3)
Goal position (G) is at (0,2)

I'll move from (4,3) to (3,3).

My next move coordinates are: (3,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape, with one vertical corridor on the left and an open area at the top.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with a "U" shaped path:

1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The path still forms a "U" shape
- It maintains the same dimensions (7x7)
- P and G are still connected via empty spaces
- The layout is different from the original but maintains the U-shaped characteristic
- The solution requires moving up through the left side and then right to reach G, similar to the original concept
