You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 P 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the next move.

Current position 'P' is at (0,1)
Goal position 'G' is at (5,5)

Looking at the maze:
- I can't move left due to a wall at (0,0)
- I can't move up as I'm at the top row
- I can move right to (0,2) as it's an empty space
- I can't move down due to a wall at (1,1)

To reach the goal, I need to first move towards the right and then find a path down.

I choose to move right to coordinates (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 P 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (0,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (5,5)

Looking at the maze:
- I can't move up as I'm at the top row
- I can't move down due to a wall at (1,2)
- I can move left to (0,1)
- I can move right to (0,3)

To reach the goal, I need to find a path that leads down. Looking at the maze structure, I can see that there's a path through the left side of the maze that eventually leads to the goal.

I choose to move left to coordinates (0,1), as this will allow me to access the vertical passage that leads down to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 P 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0

- I can't move up as I'm at the top row
- I can't move left due to a wall at (0,0)
- I can move right to (0,2)
- I can move down to (1,1)

I can see that there's a clear path down through the left side of the maze that will eventually lead to the goal. This path starts by moving down through the empty spaces in column 1.

I choose to move down to coordinates (1,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

- I can't move left due to a wall at (1,0)
- I can't move right due to a wall at (1,2)
- I can move down to (2,1)

Following the path down the left side of the maze, I can see that moving down will eventually lead me to the bottom where I can then move right towards the goal.

I choose to move down to coordinates (2,1).

- I can't move right due to a wall at (2,2)
- I can move down to (3,1)

Continuing down the left side of the maze is the correct path to eventually reach the goal. This vertical passage will lead me to the bottom where I can then move right towards the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a general "L" shape - there's a vertical corridor down the left side that turns right at the bottom to form a horizontal corridor.

Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shaped corridor but with a different arrangement:

1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions as the original (7x7)
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms an "L" shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
- The vertical part of the "L" is along column 1
- The horizontal part of the "L" is along row 5
