You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 P 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the next move.

Current position 'P' is at (0,1)
Goal position 'G' is at (5,5)

Looking at the maze:
- I can't move left due to a wall at (0,0)
- I can't move up as I'm at the top row
- I can move right to (0,2) as it's an empty space
- I can move down to (1,1) as it's an empty space

To reach the goal, I need to navigate through the empty spaces. The most efficient path appears to be going right first to create more movement options.

I choose to move right to coordinate (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 P 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0 1 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (0,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (5,5)

Looking at the maze:
- I can't move up as I'm at the top row
- I can't move down due to a wall at (1,2)
- I can move left to (0,1)
- I can move right to (0,3)

Since I need to eventually get to the goal which is at the bottom right, and there's a wall directly below me, I should continue moving right to maintain progress towards the goal.

I choose to move right to coordinate (0,3).

- I can't move down due to a wall at (1,3)
- I can move left to (0,2)
- I can move right to (0,4)

Since I need to reach the goal at the bottom right, and there's a wall directly below me, I should continue moving right to get closer to the goal's column.

I choose to move right to coordinate (0,4).

Since I need to reach the goal at (5,5), and there's a wall directly below me, I should continue moving right to get closer to the goal's column.

I choose to move right to coordinate (0,5).

Looking at the maze:
- I can't move up as I'm at the top row
- I can't move down due to a wall at (1,5)
- I can move left to (0,4)
- I can move right to (0,6)

I notice that I've reached the goal's column (column 5), but I can't move directly down due to walls. Looking at the maze structure, I need to find a path around these walls. I can see there's a path that goes down through the left side of the maze.

Since I can't progress downward here, I need to backtrack and find the correct path. I should move left and then make my way down through the open corridor on the left side of the maze.

I choose to move left to coordinate (0,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a general "U" shape - starting from the top, going down the left side, and then across the bottom to reach the goal.

Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "U" shaped corridor but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 P 0 0 0 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
1. Has the same dimensions (7x7)
2. Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
3. Is different from the original maze but maintains the "U" shape
4. The path follows down the left side and then across the bottom to reach G
5. Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for corridors, P for start, G for goal)

The main difference is that I've modified some of the wall positions in the middle and right side of the maze while preserving the essential "U" shaped path that must be followed to reach the goal.
