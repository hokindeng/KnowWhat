You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- Current position 'P' is at (0,1)
- Goal position 'G' is at (3,5)
- I need to navigate through empty spaces ('0') to reach the goal

Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to move right initially to start making my way towards the goal.

I'll move from (0,1) to (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the maze:
- I'm now at (0,2)
- The goal 'G' is at (3,5)
- I need to continue moving towards the goal while avoiding walls

I can see that I need to continue moving right along the top row, as there's a clear path and it will help me get closer to the goal position.

I'll move from (0,2) to (0,3).

My next move coordinates are: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the maze:
- I'm now at (0,3)
- The goal 'G' is at (3,5)
- I need to continue moving towards the goal while avoiding walls

I can continue moving right along the top row, as this is still the best path towards reaching the goal position.

I'll move from (0,3) to (0,4).

My next move coordinates are: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the maze:
- I'm now at (0,4)
- The goal 'G' is at (3,5)
- I need to continue moving towards the goal while avoiding walls

I can see that I should continue moving right, as there's one more empty space before I'll need to find a way down towards the goal.

I'll move from (0,4) to (0,5).

My next move coordinates are: (0,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the maze:
- I'm now at (0,5)
- The goal 'G' is at (3,5)
- I need to continue moving towards the goal while avoiding walls

Now that I've reached the right side of the top row, I need to move down to get closer to the goal. There's an empty space directly below me.

I'll move from (0,5) to (1,5).

My next move coordinates are: (1,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 P 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the maze:
- I'm now at (1,5)
- The goal 'G' is at (3,5)
- I need to continue moving towards the goal while avoiding walls

I can see that I should continue moving down, as there's an empty space below me and it leads directly towards the goal position.

I'll move from (1,5) to (2,5).

My next move coordinates are: (2,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 P 1
1 0 1 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the maze:
- I'm now at (2,5)
- The goal 'G' is at (3,5)
- I need to continue moving towards the goal while avoiding walls

I'm now just one step away from the goal position. I can move down one space to reach it.

I'll move from (2,5) to (3,5).

My next move coordinates are: (3,5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

1) The empty spaces form a general "U" shape, with one vertical corridor on the left side, one on the right side, and a horizontal corridor at the top connecting them.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size that maintains a "U" shape pattern but with a slightly different implementation:

1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Maintains a "U" shaped corridor
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original but recognizably has the same general shape
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for corridors, P for start, G for goal)

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
