You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

Current observations:
- Player (P) is at position (5,4)
- Goal (G) is at position (0,4)
- There appears to be a clear path going straight up from the player to the goal

Since I can move up, down, left, or right, and the goal is directly above the player position, the optimal next move would be to move up one space.

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "T" shape. The vertical line of the T runs from the bottom to the top in column 4, and the horizontal line spans across row 0.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a T-shape pattern with its empty spaces, but with a slightly different arrangement:

0 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical line of the T is still present in column 4
- The horizontal line of the T is along row 0
- The path from P to G is still valid through empty spaces
- The overall T shape is more pronounced and symmetrical
- The maze is different from the original but maintains the same basic T-shaped corridor structure
