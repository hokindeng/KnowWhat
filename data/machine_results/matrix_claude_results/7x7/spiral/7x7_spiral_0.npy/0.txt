You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
P 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (3,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (5,3)
3. I need to find a path avoiding walls (1's) and using empty spaces (0's)

Looking at the current position, I can see that:
- Moving up is possible (to position (2,0))
- Moving down is possible (to position (4,0))
- Moving left and right are not possible (wall on the right, edge on the left)

Given the overall layout of the maze, moving up seems to be the best choice as it will allow me to eventually reach the goal through the top path.

I choose to move to coordinates (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current position:
1. I am now at (2,0)
2. The goal is still at (5,3)
3. My possible moves are:
- Up to (1,0)
- Down to (3,0)
- Cannot move left (edge) or right (wall)

The best path to reach the goal will be to continue moving up and then right through the open path at the top of the maze.

I choose to move to coordinates (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1

2. The goal is still at (5,3)
3. My possible moves are:
- Up to (0,0)
- Down to (2,0)
- Cannot move left (edge) or right (wall)

The best path to reach the goal will be to move up and then right along the top row of the maze, which will eventually allow me to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,0).

The best path is to move right along the top row, which will eventually allow me to reach the goal through the open paths.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,1).

- Cannot move up (edge) or down (wall)

To continue making progress toward the goal, I should keep moving right along the top row.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

3. My possible moves are:

- Cannot move up (edge) or down (wall)

To continue making progress toward the goal, I should keep moving right until I reach the last open space in the top row.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

2. The goal is still at (5,3)
3. My possible moves are:
- Left to (0,4)
- Cannot move up (edge), right (wall), or down (wall)

Now that I've reached the end of the top row, I need to backtrack and find another path to reach the goal. Looking at the maze, I should go back left and then find a path down to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

2. The goal is still at (5,3)
3. My possible moves are:
- Left to (0,3)
- Right to (0,5)
- Cannot move up (edge) or down (wall)

Since moving to the right didn't help, and I need to find a path down to the goal, I should continue moving left to eventually find a path that leads downward.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,3).

3. My possible moves are:
- Left to (0,2)
- Right to (0,4)
- Cannot move up (edge) or down (wall)

I need to continue moving left until I can find a path that leads downward. Looking at the maze structure, I can see that there's a path down near the left side.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,2).

3. My possible moves are:

- Right to (0,3)
- Cannot move up (edge) or down (wall)

I need to continue moving left to reach the leftmost path that will allow me to move downward.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,1).

3. My possible moves are:
- Left to (0,0)
- Right to (0,2)
- Cannot move up (edge) or down (wall)

I should move to the leftmost position (0,0) because I can see there's a clear path down the left side of the maze that will eventually let me reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,0).

3. My possible moves are:
- Right to (0,1)
- Down to (1,0)
- Cannot move up (edge) or left (edge)

Now that I'm at the leftmost position, I can see there's a clear path down the left side of the maze. Moving down this path will eventually allow me to reach the bottom where I can move right toward the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (1,0).

- Down to (2,0)
- Cannot move left (edge) or right (wall)

I should continue moving down along the left side of the maze, which will lead me to the bottom where I can then move right toward the goal.

I should continue moving down along the left side of the maze to reach the bottom row, where I can then move right toward the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (3,0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

(1) The empty spaces form a general "U" shape, with a corridor along the top, a corridor down the left side, and a corridor along the bottom, connecting the vertical and horizontal paths.

(2) Here's a new maze with the same "U" shape pattern but with slightly different internal walls:

P 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze maintains:
- The same 7x7 size
- A "U" shaped corridor pattern
- A valid path from P to G
- Different internal wall arrangement while keeping the basic "U" shape intact
