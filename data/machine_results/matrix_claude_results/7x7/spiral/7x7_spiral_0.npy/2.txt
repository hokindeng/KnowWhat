You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
P 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (3,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (5,3)
3. I need to find a path avoiding walls (1's) and using empty spaces (0's)

Looking at the current position, I can see that:
- Moving up is possible (to position (2,0))
- Moving down is possible (to position (4,0))
- Moving left and right are not possible (wall on the right, edge on the left)

Given the overall layout of the maze, moving up seems to be the best choice as it will allow me to eventually reach the goal through the top path.

I choose to move to coordinates (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current position:
1. I am now at (2,0)
2. The goal is still at (5,3)

From my current position:
- Moving up is possible (to position (1,0))
- Moving down is possible (back to (3,0))
- Moving left and right are not possible (wall on the right, edge on the left)

Since I want to reach the goal, and I can see that the top row provides a path across, I should continue moving up to eventually access that path.

I choose to move to coordinates (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current position:
1. I am now at (1,0)
2. The goal is still at (5,3)

From my current position:
- Moving up is possible (to position (0,0))
- Moving down is possible (back to (2,0))
- Moving left and right are not possible (wall on the right, edge on the left)

Since I want to reach the goal, and I can see that the top row is clear and will allow me to move across towards the goal's column, I should continue moving up.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current position:
1. I am now at (0,0)
2. The goal is still at (5,3)

From my current position:
- Moving right is possible (to position (0,1))
- Moving down is possible (back to (1,0))
- Moving up and left are not possible (at the edges of the maze)

Now that I've reached the top row, I can move right along this clear path to get closer to the goal's column. This will allow me to eventually move down towards the goal position.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current position:
1. I am now at (0,1)
2. The goal is still at (5,3)

From my current position:
- Moving right is possible (to position (0,2))
- Moving left is possible (back to (0,0))
- Moving up and down are not possible (edge above, wall below)

I should continue moving right along the top row to get closer to the goal's column (column 3). This is the most direct path available.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,2).

From my current position:
- Moving right is possible (to position (0,3))
- Moving left is possible (back to (0,1))
- Moving up and down are not possible (edge above, wall below)

I should continue moving right along the top row until I reach column 3 (the same column as the goal). This will allow me to eventually find a path down to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,3).

2. The goal is still at (5,3)

From my current position:
- Moving right is possible (to position (0,4))
- Moving left is possible (back to (0,2))
- Moving up and down are not possible (edge above, wall below)

I'm now in the same column as the goal (column 3). However, I can't move directly down due to walls. Looking at the maze structure, I need to continue right and then find a path down that will lead me back to column 3 where the goal is.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,4).

From my current position:
- Moving right is possible (to position (0,5))
- Moving left is possible (back to (0,3))
- Moving up and down are not possible (edge above, wall below)

I should continue moving right to reach the rightmost open path, which will eventually allow me to move down and then back left towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,5).

From my current position:
- Moving down is not possible (wall)
- Moving up is not possible (edge)
- Moving left is possible (back to (0,4))
- Moving right is not possible (wall)

I've reached the rightmost position of the top row, but I can see that I'm blocked by walls and can't move down here. Looking at the maze again, I need to backtrack and find another path. I should move back left and try a different approach.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,4).

From my current position:
- Moving down is not possible (wall)
- Moving up is not possible (edge)
- Moving left is possible (back to (0,3))
- Moving right is possible (back to (0,5))

I realize now that I need to go back further left and try a different approach. Looking at the maze structure, I can see that I need to find a path that will let me get down to the goal, and the best option appears to be going back towards the left side where there are more open spaces.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,3).

From my current position:
- Moving down is not possible (wall)
- Moving up is not possible (edge)
- Moving left is possible (to (0,2))
- Moving right is possible (to (0,4))

After analyzing the maze more carefully, I can see that I need to get to the left side of the maze where there's a clear path down. From there, I can move towards the goal. So I should continue moving left.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,2).

From my current position:
- Moving down is not possible (wall)
- Moving up is not possible (edge)
- Moving left is possible (to (0,1))
- Moving right is possible (to (0,3))

I should continue moving left to reach the leftmost column, which has a clear path down. This will allow me to get to the bottom of the maze and then move right towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,1).

From my current position:
- Moving down is possible (to (1,0))
- Moving up is not possible (edge)
- Moving left is not possible (edge)
- Moving right is possible (to (0,1))

Now that I'm in the leftmost column, I can see a clear path down. This will allow me to reach the bottom of the maze, from where I can move right towards the goal. Moving down is the best choice.

I choose to move to coordinates (1,0).

From my current position:
- Moving down is possible (to (2,0))
- Moving up is possible (to (0,0))
- Moving left is not possible (edge)
- Moving right is not possible (wall)

I should continue moving down along the leftmost column, as this is the clear path that will eventually let me reach the bottom row where I can move towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (2,0).

From my current position:
- Moving down is possible (to (3,0))
- Moving up is possible (to (1,0))
- Moving left is not possible (edge)
- Moving right is not possible (wall)

I should continue moving down along the leftmost column to reach the bottom row, which will give me access to the goal position.

I choose to move to coordinates (3,0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

(1) The empty spaces form a general "U" shape. There's a vertical path down the left side, a horizontal path along the bottom, and a vertical path on the right side, connected to form a U-shaped corridor.

(2) Here's a new maze with the same U-shape pattern but with slightly different internal walls:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
P 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze maintains:
- The U-shaped corridor pattern
- Same dimensions as original
- A valid path from P to G
- Different internal wall arrangement
- The characteristic left vertical, bottom horizontal, and right vertical paths that form the U shape
