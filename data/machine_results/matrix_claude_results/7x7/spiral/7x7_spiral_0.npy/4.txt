You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
P 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (3,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (5,3)
3. I need to find a path avoiding walls (1's) and using empty spaces (0's)

Looking at the current position, I can see that:
- Moving up is possible (to position (2,0))
- Moving down is possible (to position (4,0))
- Moving left and right are not possible (wall on the right, edge on the left)

Given the overall layout of the maze, moving up seems to be the best choice as it will allow me to eventually reach the goal through the top path.

I choose to move to coordinates (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 0 0 0 0 1

0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current position:
1. I am now at (2,0)
2. The goal is still at (5,3)
3. My possible moves are:
- Up to (1,0)
- Down to (3,0)
- Cannot move left (edge) or right (wall)

The best path to reach the goal will be to continue moving up and then right through the open path at the top of the maze.

I choose to move to coordinates (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

3. My possible moves are:
- Left to (0,4)
- Cannot move up (edge), right (wall), or down (wall)

Now that I've reached the rightmost accessible position in the top row, I need to backtrack and find another path to reach the goal. Looking at the maze layout, I should go back left and then find a path down to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,4).

3. My possible moves are:
- Right to (0,5)
- Left to (0,3)
- Cannot move up (edge) or down (wall)

Since I've already explored the right path and know it doesn't lead to the goal, I should continue moving left to try to find a path down to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,3).

I need to continue moving left to eventually find a path that leads down to the goal. The leftmost column appears to have a clear path down.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

1. The empty spaces (corridors) form a "U" shape. There's a vertical path down the left side, a horizontal path along the bottom, and a vertical path on the right side, with some additional branches.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a clear U-shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

P 0 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 1 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions (7x7)
- Maintains a U-shaped corridor pattern
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze
- Uses the same encoding (0=empty space, 1=wall, P=player, G=goal)

The U-shape is formed by the left vertical corridor, bottom horizontal corridor, and right vertical corridor, making it clearly recognizable.
