You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
P 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (3,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (5,3)
3. I need to find a path avoiding walls (1's) and using empty spaces (0's)

Looking at the current position, I can see that:
- Moving up is possible (to position (2,0))
- Moving down is possible (to position (4,0))
- Moving left and right are not possible (wall on the right, edge on the left)

Given the overall layout of the maze, moving up seems to be the best choice as it will allow me to eventually reach the goal through the top path.

I choose to move to coordinates (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1

0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current position:
1. I am now at (2,0)
2. The goal is still at (5,3)

From my current position:
- Moving up is possible (to position (1,0))
- Moving down is possible (back to (3,0))
- Moving left and right are not possible (wall on the right, edge on the left)

To reach the goal, I need to continue moving upward to eventually access the top path that will lead me to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (1,0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

1. The empty spaces form a "U" shape. There's a vertical path down the left side, a horizontal path along the bottom, and a vertical path on the right side, with the top being open.

2. Here's a new maze with the same U-shape pattern but with slightly different internal walls:
```
P 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

This new maze maintains the U-shape corridor structure but has different internal wall placements while still providing a valid path from P to G.
