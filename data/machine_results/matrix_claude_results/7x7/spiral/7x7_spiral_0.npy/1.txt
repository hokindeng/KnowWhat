You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
P 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (3,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (5,3)
3. I need to find a path avoiding walls (1's) and using empty spaces (0's)

Looking at the current position, I can see that:
- Moving up is possible (to position (2,0))
- Moving down is possible (to position (4,0))
- Moving left and right are not possible (wall to the right, edge of maze to the left)

Given the layout of the maze, moving up seems to be the best choice as it will allow me to eventually reach the goal by going through the top path.

I choose to move to coordinates (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current position:
1. I am now at (2,0)
2. My options are:
- Moving up is possible (to position (1,0))
- Moving down is not possible (already explored)
- Moving left and right are not possible (wall to the right, edge of maze to the left)

The best path to reach the goal will be to continue moving up and then traverse to the right through the top row of empty spaces.

I choose to move to coordinates (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1

2. My options are:
- Moving up is possible (to position (0,0))
- Moving down is not possible (already explored)
- Moving left and right are not possible (wall to the right, edge of maze to the left)

To reach the goal, I need to continue moving up to access the top row of empty spaces, which will allow me to traverse to the right and then down towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,0).

2. My options are:
- Moving up is not possible (edge of maze)
- Moving down is not possible (already explored)
- Moving left is not possible (edge of maze)
- Moving right is possible (to position (0,1))

Now that I've reached the top row, I can move right through the empty spaces to eventually make my way down to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

2. My options are:
- Moving up is not possible (edge of maze)
- Moving down is not possible (wall)
- Moving left is possible (but would backtrack)
- Moving right is possible (to position (0,2))

Continuing to move right along the top row is the best path to eventually reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

2. My options are:
- Moving up is not possible (edge of maze)
- Moving down is not possible (wall)
- Moving left is possible (but would backtrack)
- Moving right is possible (to position (0,3))

Continuing to move right along the top row remains the best strategy to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,3).

- Moving right is possible (to position (0,5))

Continuing to move right to reach the last empty space in the top row, which will then allow me to find a path down to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,5).

Now that I've reached the rightmost accessible position in the top row, I need to backtrack to find a path down to the goal. Moving left will allow me to explore other paths.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,4).

2. My options are:
- Moving up is not possible (edge of maze)
- Moving down is not possible (wall)
- Moving left is possible (to position (0,3))
- Moving right is possible (but just came from there)

I realize I need to backtrack further to find a different path down to the goal. The best route will likely be to go back to the left side of the maze where there are more open spaces that lead to the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

1. The empty spaces (corridors) form a general "U" shape. There's a vertical path down the left side, a horizontal path along the bottom, and another vertical path on the right side, connected at the bottom.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains the U-shape pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

P 0 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 1 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Maintains the U-shaped corridor pattern
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Has different wall placements than the original
- Is the same size (7x7)
- Uses the same encoding (0=empty space, 1=wall, P=player, G=goal)

The U-shape is still clearly visible: down the left side, across the bottom, and up the right side.
