You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 P 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The player (P) is at position (4,1)
- The goal (G) is at position (1,4)
- I need to find a path from P to G avoiding walls (1s)

Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to move up first to reach the goal. The empty spaces (0s) provide a clear path.

For my first move, I'll move up from position (4,1) to (3,1).

My next move coordinates are: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (3,1)
- The goal (G) is still at position (1,4)
- I need to continue moving towards the goal while avoiding walls

From my current position, I need to move up again to reach the path that leads to the goal.

I'll move up from position (3,1) to (2,1).

My next move coordinates are: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (2,1)
- The goal (G) is at position (1,4)
- I need to continue moving towards the goal while avoiding walls

From my current position, I need to move up one more time to reach the row where I can then move right towards the goal.

I'll move up from position (2,1) to (1,1).

My next move coordinates are: (1,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (1,1)
- The goal (G) is at position (1,4)
- I need to continue moving towards the goal while avoiding walls

Now that I'm on the same row as the goal, I can move right to reach it. I'll move from position (1,1) to (1,2).

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (1,2)
- The goal (G) is at position (1,4)
- I need to continue moving towards the goal while avoiding walls

I'll continue moving right along the clear path towards the goal. I'll move from position (1,2) to (1,3).

My next move coordinates are: (1,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P G 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (1,3)
- The goal (G) is at position (1,4)
- I'm just one step away from the goal

For my final move, I'll move right one more time from position (1,3) to reach the goal at (1,4).

My next move coordinates are: (1,4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form:

1) A general "T" shape, with:
- A horizontal corridor along the top
- A vertical corridor down the left side

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "T" shape pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P G 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same T-shaped corridor structure
- Maintains a valid path from P to G
- Has different wall placements than the original
- Is the same 7x7 size
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for paths, P for player, G for goal)

The T-shape is still clearly visible, with a horizontal corridor at the top and a vertical corridor, though the exact dimensions and some wall placements are different from the original.
