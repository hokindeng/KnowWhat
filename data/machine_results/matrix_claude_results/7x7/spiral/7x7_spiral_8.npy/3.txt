You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 P 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The player (P) is at position (4,1)
- The goal (G) is at position (1,4)
- I need to find a path from P to G avoiding walls (1s)

Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to move up first to reach the goal. The empty spaces (0s) show a clear path upward.

For my next move, I will move up from position (4,1) to position (3,1).

My next move coordinates are: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (3,1)
- The goal (G) is still at position (1,4)
- I need to continue finding a path while avoiding walls

From my current position, I need to move up again to eventually reach the goal. There is an empty space above me.

For my next move, I will move up from position (3,1) to position (2,1).

My next move coordinates are: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (2,1)
- The goal (G) is at position (1,4)
- I need to continue finding a path while avoiding walls

From my current position, I need to move up one more time to reach the row where the goal is located.

For my next move, I will move up from position (2,1) to position (1,1).

My next move coordinates are: (1,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (1,1)
- The goal (G) is at position (1,4)
- I need to continue finding a path while avoiding walls

From my current position, I can see a clear path to the goal along the same row. I need to move right to reach the goal.

For my next move, I will move right from position (1,1) to position (1,2).

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (1,2)
- The goal (G) is at position (1,4)
- I need to continue finding a path while avoiding walls

I'm getting closer to the goal. I need to continue moving right along the same row.

For my next move, I will move right from position (1,2) to position (1,3).

My next move coordinates are: (1,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P G 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (1,3)
- The goal (G) is at position (1,4)
- I'm just one step away from the goal

I can reach the goal with one final move to the right.

For my next move, I will move right from position (1,3) to position (1,4) to reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (1,4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is an "L" shape. The path requires going up and then right, forming a 90-degree angle characteristic of the letter L.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an L-shaped corridor pattern but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1

In this new maze:
- The L-shape is still present but rotated and positioned differently
- There's a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
- The pattern is different from the original while keeping the L-shape concept
- The walls and corridors are properly encoded using 1s and 0s respectively
