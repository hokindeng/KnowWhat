You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0 1 0
1 P 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal 'G'.

Current observations:
- The player 'P' is at position (4,1)
- The goal 'G' is at position (1,4)
- We need to move up and right to reach the goal

For my next move, I want to move up from position (4,1) to (3,1), which is an empty space.

I choose coordinates: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 0 1 0

1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
- The player 'P' is now at position (3,1)
- The goal 'G' is at position (1,4)
- We need to continue moving up and then right to reach the goal

For my next move, I want to move up from position (3,1) to (2,1), which is an empty space.

I choose coordinates: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Current observations:
- The player 'P' is now at position (2,1)
- The goal 'G' is at position (1,4)
- We need to move up and then right to reach the goal

For my next move, I want to move up from position (2,1) to (1,1), which is an empty space.

I choose coordinates: (1,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
- The player 'P' is now at position (1,1)
- The goal 'G' is at position (1,4)
- We can now move right through the empty spaces to reach the goal

For my next move, I want to move right from position (1,1) to (1,2), which is an empty space.

I choose coordinates: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

- The goal 'G' is at position (1,4)
- We can continue moving right through the empty spaces to reach the goal

For my next move, I want to move right from position (1,2) to (1,3), which is an empty space.

I choose coordinates: (1,3)

Current observations:
- The player 'P' is now at position (1,3)
- The goal 'G' is at position (1,4)
- We are just one step away from the goal

For my next move, I want to move right from position (1,3) to (1,4) to reach the goal.

I choose coordinates: (1,4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) is an "L" shape. The main corridors form a clear L pattern, with one vertical segment and one horizontal segment meeting at a right angle.

2) Here's my new maze design with the same L-shaped corridor pattern:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms an L-shaped corridor pattern
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same basic shape concept
- The L-shape is formed by a vertical corridor going up and then turning right to reach the goal
