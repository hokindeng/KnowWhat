You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 G 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

Current observations:
- Player (P) is at position (5,5)
- Goal (G) is at position (3,4)
- There's a clear path going up and then left to reach the goal

For my next move, I want to move up from the current position (5,5) to (4,5).

However, looking at the maze, I notice that position (4,5) is a wall (1). Let me revise.

The best path would be to move left first, so I choose to move from (5,5) to (5,4).

My next move coordinates are: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 G 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:
- Player (P) is now at position (5,4)
- Goal (G) is still at position (3,4)
- I need to continue moving left to find a path up to the goal

I'll move left again, from (5,4) to (5,3).

My next move coordinates are: (5,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:
- Player (P) is now at position (5,3)
- Goal (G) is at position (3,4)
- I need to continue moving left until I can find a path up to the goal

I'll move left again, from (5,3) to (5,2).

My next move coordinates are: (5,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:
- Player (P) is now at position (5,2)
- Goal (G) is at position (3,4)
- I need to continue moving left until I can find a path up to the goal

I'll move left again, from (5,2) to (5,1).

My next move coordinates are: (5,1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:
- Player (P) is now at position (5,1)
- Goal (G) is at position (3,4)
- I can now move up through the leftmost column to get closer to the goal

I'll move up, from (5,1) to (4,1).

My next move coordinates are: (4,1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 G 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1) The empty spaces form a general "U" shape, with one vertical corridor on the left, one on the right, and a horizontal corridor at the bottom connecting them.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size that maintains the U-shape pattern but with a slightly different arrangement:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
P 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 G 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Maintains the U-shape corridor pattern
- Has the same dimensions (7x7)
- Provides a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze but recognizably has the same general shape
- Uses the same encoding (0 for paths, 1 for walls, P for player, G for goal)
