You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 G 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The player (P) is currently at position (5,5)
- The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
- I need to find a path from P to G through empty spaces (0)

Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to move upward to start making my way to the goal. The first logical move would be to move up from (5,5) to (4,5).

However, I can see that position (4,5) is a wall (1). Let me revise:
I should move left first, so my next move should be to position (5,4).

I choose to move to coordinates: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 G 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
- I am now at position (5,4)
- The goal (G) is still at (3,4)
- I need to continue moving towards the goal

From my current position, I can see that I need to move upward to eventually reach the goal. Looking at the path, I can see that moving up is possible as there's an empty space at (4,4), but that would lead to a dead end due to walls.

I should continue moving left to find a clear path up. Therefore, I'll move to position (5,3).

I choose to move to coordinates: (5,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 G 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
- I am now at position (5,3)
- The goal (G) is still at (3,4)
- I need to continue moving towards the goal

From my current position, I can see that I need to keep moving left to find a path that will allow me to move upward. I can see that there's a potential path up through the left side of the maze.

Therefore, I'll continue moving left to position (5,2).

I choose to move to coordinates: (5,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 G 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
- I am now at position (5,2)
- The goal (G) is still at (3,4)
- I need to continue moving towards the goal

I can see that I need to continue moving left to reach the clear path that goes up along the left side of the maze. This will eventually allow me to reach the goal.

Therefore, I'll move left to position (5,1).

I choose to move to coordinates: (5,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 G 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
- I am now at position (5,1)
- The goal (G) is still at (3,4)
- I need to continue moving towards the goal

Now I've reached the left side of the maze where there's a clear path upward. I can move up along this path which will eventually allow me to reach the goal.

Therefore, I'll move up to position (4,1).

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 G 0 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
- I am now at position (4,0)
- The goal (G) is still at (3,4)
- I need to continue moving towards the goal

I can see that I can continue moving up along the left side of the maze. This path will eventually allow me to reach the third row where I can move right towards the goal.

Therefore, I'll move up to position (3,0).

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
P 1 0 0 G 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
- I am now at position (3,0)
- The goal (G) is still at (3,4)
- I need to continue moving towards the goal

I'm now on the same row as the goal. I can see that there's a clear path from my position to the goal through the empty spaces (0s) at positions (3,2) and (3,3).

Therefore, I'll move right to position (3,2).

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 0 G 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

1) The empty spaces form a general "U" shape. The path requires going down one side of the U, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze with the same U-shaped corridor pattern:
```
0 0 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
P 1 1 0 G 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The U-shape is maintained but slightly modified
- The path from P to G is still valid through empty spaces
- The overall dimensions are the same (7x7)
- The maze is different from the original but maintains the same general shape concept
