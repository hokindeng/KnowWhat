You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 P 1 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal 'G'.

Current observations:
- Player 'P' is at position (3,2)
- Goal 'G' is at position (4,0)
- We need to move left and down to reach the goal

For the next move, I'll move left to position (3,1), as this will bring us closer to the goal while staying on valid empty spaces.

My next move coordinates are: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 P 0 1 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:
- Player 'P' is now at position (3,1)
- Goal 'G' is at position (4,0)
- We need to continue moving left and then down to reach the goal

For the next move, I'll move left to position (3,0), continuing our path toward the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
P 0 0 1 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:
- Player 'P' is now at position (3,0)
- Goal 'G' is at position (4,0)
- We're directly above the goal

For the next move, I'll move down to position (4,0), which will take us directly to the goal position.

My next move coordinates are: (4,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape, with the vertical parts of the U on the left and right sides, connected by a horizontal corridor at the top.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "U" shape pattern with its empty spaces, but with a different specific arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
P 1 0 0 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions (7x7)
- Maintains a U-shaped corridor pattern
- Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original maze
- The empty spaces still form a recognizable U shape, with vertical corridors on the left and right sides connected by a horizontal corridor, though the specific details of the paths are different
