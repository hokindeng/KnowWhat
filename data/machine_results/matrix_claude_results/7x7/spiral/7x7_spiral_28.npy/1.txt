You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 P
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (1,6)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I need to find a path avoiding walls (1's) and moving through empty spaces (0's)

Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to move left and then down to reach the goal. The first step should be moving left to the empty space at (1,5).

However, I notice that's not possible since there's a wall at (1,5). Looking more carefully, I need to first move up to access the open path.

Therefore, I choose to move UP to coordinate (0,6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 P
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0,6), I can see a clear path:
1. I need to move left through the open spaces
2. Then move down to reach the goal at (4,2)

From my current position at (0,6), I'll move LEFT to coordinate (0,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 P 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing along the path to reach the goal:
1. I'm currently at (0,5)
2. I need to keep moving left through the open spaces
3. Eventually I'll need to move down to reach the goal at (4,2)

I'll move LEFT again to coordinate (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 P 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing along the path:
1. I'm currently at (0,4)
2. I need to keep moving left until I can safely move down
3. The goal is at (4,2)

I'll move LEFT again to coordinate (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 P 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing along the path:
1. I'm currently at (0,3)
2. I need to keep moving left until I reach the open vertical path that leads to the goal
3. The goal is at (4,2)

I'll move LEFT again to coordinate (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 P 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I've reached the vertical path that leads to the goal:
1. I'm currently at (0,2)
2. I can see a clear path downward that leads directly to the goal at (4,2)

I'll move DOWN to coordinate (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 P 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing down the vertical path:
1. I'm currently at (1,2)
2. I need to keep moving down to reach the goal at (4,2)

I'll move DOWN to coordinate (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 P 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Almost there:
1. I'm currently at (2,2)
2. The goal is just two steps down at (4,2)

I'll move DOWN to coordinate (3,2).

Oh wait - I notice there's a wall at (3,2). Looking at the maze more carefully now, I need to move DOWN to (4,2) directly from here since that space is open.

I'll move DOWN to coordinate (4,2), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a clear "T" shape, with a horizontal corridor along the top row and a vertical corridor down the middle.

Here's my new maze with a "T" shaped corridor pattern:

1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
1. The horizontal part of the T is along row 0
2. The vertical part of the T goes down column 2
3. P is placed at (0,1) and G at (4,2)
4. The path from P to G is clear and follows the T shape
5. The walls are arranged differently from the original maze while maintaining the T-shaped corridor structure
