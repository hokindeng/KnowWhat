You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 P
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- Current position 'P' is at (1,6)
- Goal position 'G' is at (4,2)
- I need to find a path avoiding walls ('1')

Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to move left and down to reach the goal. The first step should be moving left to the empty space at (1,5).

I choose to move to coordinates: (1,5)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shaped corridor but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the "L" runs down the fifth column
- The horizontal part of the "L" runs along the sixth row
- The player 'P' starts at the top of the vertical corridor
- The goal 'G' is positioned along the horizontal corridor
- The path is still valid and maintains the "L" shape
- The maze has different wall placements but preserves the essential "L" shaped corridor structure
