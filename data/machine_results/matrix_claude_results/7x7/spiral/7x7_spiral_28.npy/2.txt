You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 P
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (1,6)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I need to find a path avoiding walls (1's) and moving through empty spaces (0's)

Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to move left and then down to reach the goal. The first step should be moving left to the empty space at (1,5).

However, I notice that's not possible since that position contains a wall (1). Looking at the available moves from my current position (1,6):
- Up: (0,6) - This is an empty space (0)
- Down: (2,6) - This is an empty space (0)
- Left: (1,5) - This is a wall (1)
- Right: Not possible (edge of maze)

I will move UP to position (0,6).

My next move coordinates are: (0,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 P
1 1 0 1 1 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (0,6)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I need to move left to get closer to the goal

From my current position (0,6), my available moves are:
- Up: Not possible (edge of maze)
- Down: (1,6) - This is an empty space (0)
- Left: (0,5) - This is an empty space (0)
- Right: Not possible (edge of maze)

I will move LEFT to position (0,5) to start making my way towards the goal.

3. I need to continue moving down in column 2 to reach the goal

From my current position (2,2), my available moves are:
- Up: (1,2) - This is an empty space (0)
- Down: (3,2) - This is a wall (1)
- Left: (2,1) - This is a wall (1)
- Right: (2,3) - This is an empty space (0)

I notice that I can't move directly down anymore because there's a wall at (3,2). I'll need to find another path. Looking at the maze, I can see that I can move right and then use the empty spaces to go around and reach the goal.

I will move RIGHT to position (2,3).

My next move coordinates are: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,3)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I need to find a path around the wall to reach the goal

From my current position (2,3), my available moves are:
- Up: (1,3) - This is a wall (1)
- Down: (3,3) - This is a wall (1)
- Left: (2,2) - This is an empty space (0)
- Right: (2,4) - This is an empty space (0)

Since I can't go down directly to the goal due to walls, I need to move right and then find a path down and back left to reach the goal. 

I will move RIGHT to position (2,4).

My next move coordinates are: (2,4)

2. Goal position 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I need to find a path down and then left to reach the goal

From my current position (2,4), my available moves are:

- Down: (3,4) - This is a wall (1)
- Left: (2,3) - This is an empty space (0)
- Right: (2,5) - This is a wall (1)

I notice that I'm actually blocked here - I can't move down because of walls, and moving right or up are blocked. The only move available is to go back left, which would just retrace my steps.

Let me revise my strategy. I need to go back and find another path. 

I will move LEFT to position (2,3).

My next move coordinates are: (2,3)

From my current position (2,3), my available moves are:

- Down: (3,3) - This is a wall (1)
- Left: (2,2) - This is an empty space (0)
- Right: (2,4) - This is an empty space (0)

I realize now that trying to go right wasn't the correct approach. Looking at the maze again, I should go back left and try to find another way to reach the goal.

I will move LEFT to position (2,2).

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

- Down: (3,2) - This is a wall (1)
- Left: (2,1) - This is a wall (1)
- Right: (2,3) - This is an empty space (0)

I realize now that there might not be a direct path down through column 2. Looking at the overall maze again, I notice that I can go up and then try to find a path around through the empty spaces at the top of the maze.

I will move UP to position (1,2).

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0

3. I need to find a path to the goal

From my current position (1,2), my available moves are:

- Down: (2,2) - This is an empty space (0)
- Left: (1,1) - This is a wall (1)
- Right: (1,3) - This is a wall (1)

I can see that going up and down in column 2 isn't helping me reach the goal. Let me try going UP to the top row where there are more empty spaces that might lead to a better path.

I will move UP to position (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

- Right: (0,3) - This is an empty space (0)

Now that I'm in the top row, I can see that there are empty spaces to the right that might lead to a better path. I can try going right and then finding a way down through the right side of the maze where there are more empty spaces.

I will move RIGHT to position (0,3).

I can continue moving right to explore the path that might lead down through the right side of the maze where there are more empty spaces.

- Down: (1,4) - This is a wall (1)
- Left: (0,3) - This is an empty space (0)
- Right: (0,5) - This is an empty space (0)

I can continue moving right to reach the rightmost column where there appears to be a continuous path of empty spaces leading down.

I will move RIGHT to position (0,5).

My next move coordinates are: (0,5)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 0 0 P 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape. There's a vertical corridor on the left side (column 2), a horizontal corridor at the top (row 0), and a vertical corridor on the right side (column 6), with some additional empty spaces in the middle.

2) Here's a new maze with the same U-shaped pattern but slightly different:

1 1 0 0 0 0 P
1 1 0 1 1 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 0 0
1 1 G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions (7x7)
- Maintains a U-shaped corridor pattern
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze
- The U-shape is more clearly defined with cleaner corridors
