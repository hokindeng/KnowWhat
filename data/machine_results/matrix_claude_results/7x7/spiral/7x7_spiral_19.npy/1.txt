You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 P
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,6)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (5,6)
3. I need to reach the goal while avoiding walls ('1')

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach the goal, I need to move down. The space below my current position is empty ('0').

My next move should be to position (4,6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 P
1 1 0 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,6)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (5,6)
3. I need to reach the goal while avoiding walls ('1')

The goal is directly below my current position and that space is empty ('0').

My next move should be to position (5,6), which will take me to the goal 'G'.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 P
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

(1) The empty spaces form a general "U" shape, with one vertical corridor on the left side, a horizontal corridor at the bottom, and another vertical corridor on the right side.

(2) Here's a new maze with the same "U" shape pattern but with slightly different dimensions of the corridors:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 1 P
1 0 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze maintains:
- The same U-shaped corridor pattern
- A valid path from P to G
- Different specific layout but same general shape
- The same overall dimensions as the original
