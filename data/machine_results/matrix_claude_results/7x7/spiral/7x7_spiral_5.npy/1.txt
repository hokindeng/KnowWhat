You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 G 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,2)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (2,4)
3. Looking at possible moves from current position:
   - Up: blocked by wall
   - Down: empty space at (3,2)
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: blocked by wall

Since we need to reach the goal at (2,4), and we can't move directly right due to the wall, we'll need to find a path around. Looking at the maze, I can see we need to:
1. Go down first
2. Then go right through the bottom path
3. Then go up to reach the goal

For the first move, I'll choose to move DOWN to coordinate (3,2).

My next move coordinates are: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 0 0
1 1 P 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,2), I can see:
- Up: empty space at (2,2)
- Down: empty space at (4,2)
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall

To reach the goal at (2,4), I need to:
1. Go down to access the bottom path
2. Then move right through the open corridor
3. Then move up to reach the goal

Therefore, I'll move DOWN to coordinate (4,2).

My next move coordinates are: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,2), I can see:
- Up: empty space at (3,2)
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: empty space at (4,3)

Now that I've reached the bottom path, I need to:
1. Move right through the corridor
2. Then eventually move up to reach the goal

Therefore, I'll move RIGHT to coordinate (4,3).

My next move coordinates are: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,3), I can see:
- Up: blocked by wall
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: empty space at (4,2)
- Right: empty space at (4,4)

To reach the goal at (2,4), I need to:
1. Continue moving right until I can move up
2. Then move up to reach the goal

Therefore, I'll move RIGHT to coordinate (4,4).

My next move coordinates are: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,4), I can see:
- Up: blocked by wall
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: empty space at (4,3)
- Right: empty space at (4,5)

To reach the goal at (2,4), I need to:
1. Move right one more space
2. Then move up to reach the goal

Therefore, I'll move RIGHT to coordinate (4,5).

My next move coordinates are: (4,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,5), I can see:
- Up: empty space at (3,5)
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: empty space at (4,4)
- Right: empty space at (4,6)

Now that I've moved far enough right, I can start moving up towards the goal. The goal is at (2,4), and I can reach it by moving up and then left.

Therefore, I'll move UP to coordinate (3,5).

My next move coordinates are: (3,5)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a "U" shape - starting from the top, going down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side.

Here's my new maze design with the same U-shape pattern:

1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 G 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This maze:
1. Has the same 7x7 dimensions
2. Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
3. Is different from the original maze
4. Maintains a U-shaped corridor pattern
5. Uses the same encoding (1=wall, 0=empty space, P=player, G=goal)

The main differences from the original are:
- The U-shape is more symmetrical
- The corridors are positioned slightly differently
- The walls are arranged differently while maintaining the U-shape pattern
