You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 G 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,2)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (2,4)
3. Looking at possible moves from current position:
   - Up: blocked by wall
   - Down: empty space at (3,2)
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: blocked by wall

Since we need to reach the goal at (2,4) and we can't move directly right due to the wall, we'll need to find a path around. Looking at the maze, we can see a path that goes:
- Down first
- Then right through the bottom path
- Then up to reach the goal

For the first move, I choose to move DOWN to coordinate (3,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 0 0
1 1 P 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,2)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (2,4)
3. Possible moves from current position:
   - Up: empty space at (2,2)
   - Down: empty space at (4,2)
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: blocked by wall

Since we need to reach the goal at (2,4) and we can't move directly right due to the wall, we need to go down to access the path that will lead us around. 

I choose to move DOWN to coordinate (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,2)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (2,4)
3. Possible moves from current position:
   - Up: empty space at (3,2)
   - Down: blocked by wall
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: empty space at (4,3)

Now that we've reached the bottom path, we can start moving right to get around the wall blocking our direct path to the goal.

I choose to move RIGHT to coordinate (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,3)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (2,4)
3. Possible moves from current position:
   - Up: blocked by wall
   - Down: blocked by wall
   - Left: empty space at (4,2)
   - Right: empty space at (4,4)

Continuing along the bottom path to get around the wall, we should keep moving right.

I choose to move RIGHT to coordinate (4,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,4)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (2,4)
3. Possible moves from current position:
   - Up: blocked by wall
   - Down: blocked by wall
   - Left: empty space at (4,3)
   - Right: empty space at (4,5)

We should continue moving right until we can move up towards the goal.

I choose to move RIGHT to coordinate (4,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,5)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (2,4)
3. Possible moves from current position:
   - Up: empty space at (3,5)
   - Down: blocked by wall
   - Left: empty space at (4,4)
   - Right: empty space at (4,6)

Now that we've gotten around the wall, we can start moving up towards the goal.

I choose to move UP to coordinate (3,5).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 G 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

(1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape, where you need to go down one side of the U, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal.

(2) Here's a new maze with the same U-shaped corridor pattern:

1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 P 1 1 G 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The U-shape is shifted slightly left
- The walls are rearranged while maintaining the U-shaped corridor
- There's still a valid path from P to G following the U shape
- The size is the same (7x7)
- The pattern is different from the original but maintains the same general shape concept
