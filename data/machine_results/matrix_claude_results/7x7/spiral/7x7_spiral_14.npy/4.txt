You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 P 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 G
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,2)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,6)
3. I need to find a path through empty spaces ('0')

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach the goal, I need to:
1. Move up to access the corridor
2. Move right through the corridor
3. Move down to reach the goal

For my first move, I'll move up to position (1,2).

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 G
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (1,2), I can see that I need to move right through the corridor to eventually reach the goal.

I'll move right to position (1,3).

My next move coordinates are: (1,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 G
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving right through the corridor.

From my current position at (1,3), I'll move right to position (1,4).

My next move coordinates are: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 G
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1,4), I need to move down to get closer to the goal.

I'll move down to position (2,4).

My next move coordinates are: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 P 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 G
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,4), I need to move down one more step to get closer to the goal.

I'll move down to position (3,4).

My next move coordinates are: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 P 1 G
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,4), I can now move right to get closer to the goal.

I'll move right to position (3,5).

My next move coordinates are: (3,5)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path requires going up one side of the U, across the top, and down the other side to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "U" shape pattern but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The U-shape is more symmetrical
- The path still requires going up one side, across, and down the other side
- The walls create a clear U-shaped corridor
- The start (P) and goal (G) positions are placed at opposite ends of the U
- It's different from the original maze but maintains the same basic shape concept
