You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 P 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal 'G'.

Current observations:
1. Player 'P' is at position (5,3) (counting from left to right, top to bottom)
2. Goal 'G' is at position (4,5)
3. There's a clear path downward and then left to reach the goal

For my next move, I want to move down one space to position (5,4).

Therefore, my next move coordinates are: (5,4)

This will begin creating a path toward the goal while avoiding walls.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape, with two vertical corridors connected by a horizontal path at the bottom.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "U" shape pattern but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions as the original
- Forms a "U" shape with its corridors
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze
- Maintains the same encoding system (1 for walls, 0 for paths, P for player, G for goal)

The U-shape is formed by having two vertical passages connected by a horizontal path at the bottom, similar to the original but with different specific arrangements of the walls.
