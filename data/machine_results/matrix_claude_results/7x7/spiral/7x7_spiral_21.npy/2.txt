You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

G 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

Current observations:
- Player (P) is at position (4,0)
- Goal (G) is at position (0,0)
- There appears to be a clear path going up along the left edge of the maze

For my next move, I want to move up from position (4,0) to position (3,0).

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

G 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving up along the left edge of the maze towards the goal.

Current observations:
- Player (P) is at position (3,0)
- Goal (G) is at position (0,0)
- The clear path continues upward

For my next move, I want to move up from position (3,0) to position (2,0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

G 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
P 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving up along the left edge of the maze towards the goal.

Current observations:
- Player (P) is at position (2,0)
- Goal (G) is at position (0,0)
- The clear path continues upward

For my next move, I want to move up from position (2,0) to position (1,0).

My next move coordinates are: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

G 0 0 0 0 1 1
P 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now just one step away from the goal.

Current observations:
- Player (P) is at position (1,0)
- Goal (G) is at position (0,0)
- One final move upward will reach the goal

For my next move, I want to move up from position (1,0) to position (0,0).

My next move coordinates are: (0,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces (0s) in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape, with one corridor going up along the left edge and another corridor extending to the right at the top.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shaped corridor pattern but with a slightly different arrangement:

G 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the "L" is still along the left edge
- The horizontal part of the "L" is still at the top
- The main difference is that I've made the vertical corridor straighter and removed the small branch in the middle that was present in the original
- The path from P to G remains valid through empty spaces
- The overall "L" shape is maintained but with a cleaner, more defined form
