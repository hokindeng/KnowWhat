You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

G 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

Current observations:
- Player (P) is at position (4,0)
- Goal (G) is at position (0,0)
- There appears to be a clear path going up along the left edge of the maze

Since I need to reach the goal at (0,0) and I'm currently at (4,0), the best move would be to move up one position.

I choose to move to coordinates (3,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

G 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I need to continue moving up towards the goal position.

Current observations:
- Player (P) is at position (3,0)
- Goal (G) is at position (0,0)
- There is still a clear path going up along the left edge of the maze

I choose to move to coordinates (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

G 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
P 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I need to continue moving up towards the goal position.

Current observations:
- Player (P) is at position (2,0)
- Goal (G) is at position (0,0)
- There is still a clear path going up along the left edge of the maze

I choose to move to coordinates (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

G 0 0 0 0 1 1
P 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now just one step away from the goal!

Current observations:
- Player (P) is at position (1,0)
- Goal (G) is at position (0,0)
- One final move up will reach the goal

I choose to move to coordinates (0,0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape, with one corridor going up along the left edge and another corridor extending to the right at the top.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shaped corridor pattern but with a different arrangement:

G 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the "L" is along the left side
- The horizontal part of the "L" extends along the bottom
- There is a valid path from P to G
- The shape is still recognizable as an "L" but with different proportions
- The maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions as the original
