You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 G 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 P 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (5,2)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (3,4)
3. I need to find a path through empty spaces ('0')

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach the goal, I need to:
1. Move up through the empty spaces
2. Navigate around to reach the goal

The first step should be to move up from my current position at (5,2) to (4,2).

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 G 1 0
1 1 P 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (4,2)
2. The goal 'G' is at (3,4)
3. I need to continue moving upward to eventually reach the path that leads to the goal

From my current position at (4,2), I should continue moving up to (3,2).

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 P 1 G 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (3,2)
2. The goal 'G' is at (3,4)
3. I need to continue moving up to reach the path that will lead to the goal

From my current position at (3,2), I should move up to (2,2), which will allow me to eventually access the path leading to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 G 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (2,2)
2. The goal 'G' is at (3,4)
3. I can now access the path that leads to the goal by moving right through the empty spaces

From my current position at (2,2), I should move right to (2,4) to get closer to the goal. However, I can only move one space at a time, so I'll move to (2,4).

I choose to move to coordinates: (2,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 G 1 0
1 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 1 P 1 1 1 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape, with one vertical corridor on the left and a horizontal corridor at the bottom, connected to another vertical corridor on the right.

2) Here's a new maze with the same "U" shape pattern but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1

This new maze maintains:
- The same 7x7 dimensions
- A "U" shaped corridor pattern
- Valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Different specific layout but same general shape concept
