You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
P 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

Current observations:
- Player (P) is at position (6,0)
- Goal (G) is at position (3,0)
- There's a wall of '1's creating a barrier that requires going around

Looking at the maze, I need to move up to start making my way towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (5,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 1 0
P 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
- I'm now at position (5,0)
- The goal is still at (3,0)
- I need to continue moving up to reach the goal

I choose to move to coordinates (4,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
- I'm now at position (4,0)
- The goal is at (3,0)
- I can move directly up to reach the goal

I choose to move to coordinates (3,0), which is the goal position (G).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path requires going down one side of the U, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a U-shaped corridor pattern but with a different arrangement:

0 0 G 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 P 0 1 0 0 0

This new maze:
- Maintains the U-shape corridor pattern
- Has different wall placements but preserves the general shape
- Provides a valid path from P to G
- Has the same dimensions as the original
- Is not identical to the original maze
- The U-shape is clearly recognizable in the empty spaces
