You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- Current position 'P' is at (0,0)
- Goal position 'G' is at (1,4)
- I need to find a path from P to G through empty spaces (0s)

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach G, I need to:
1. Move right along the top row until I can reach G
2. G is in the second row, so I'll need to move down when I'm above it

For my first move, I'll move right from (0,0) to (0,1), as this is an empty space and brings me closer to the goal.

I choose coordinates: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving right along the top row to get closer to the goal position at (1,4).

From my current position at (0,1), I'll move right to (0,2).

I choose coordinates: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing with my strategy of moving right along the top row to get closer to the goal position at (1,4).

From my current position at (0,2), I'll move right to (0,3).

I choose coordinates: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (0,3) and getting closer to the goal at (1,4). 

From my current position, I'll move right to (0,4), which will position me directly above the goal position.

I choose coordinates: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (0,4) and directly above the goal position at (1,4).

For my final move, I'll move down to reach the goal at (1,4).

I choose coordinates: (1,4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

1) The empty spaces (corridors) form a general "T" shape. The top horizontal line of the T runs along the top row, and the vertical line of the T extends downward from the right side.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a T-shaped corridor pattern but with a slightly different arrangement:

P 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The horizontal part of the T is along the top row
- The vertical part of the T extends downward from the right side
- There's still a valid path from P to G
- The shape is clearly recognizable as a T
- The layout is different from the original while maintaining the same general shape
