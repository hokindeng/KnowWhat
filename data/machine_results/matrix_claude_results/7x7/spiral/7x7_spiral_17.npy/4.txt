You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- Current position 'P' is at (0,0)
- Goal position 'G' is at (1,4)
- I need to find a path through empty spaces ('0')

Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to move right first to eventually reach the goal. The path will need to go right and then down through the empty spaces.

For my first move, I'll move right to coordinate (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving right along the top row to get closer to the goal.

My next move will be to coordinate (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving right along the top row to get closer to the goal.

My next move will be to coordinate (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving right along the top row to reach the space just before the goal.

My next move will be to coordinate (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm directly above the goal, I'll move down to reach it.

My next move will be to coordinate (1,4), which is the goal position 'G'.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a general "L" shape, with one corridor along the top row and another corridor going down vertically on the right side.

Here's my new maze design that maintains this "L" shape pattern:

P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The horizontal part of the "L" is along the top
- The vertical part of the "L" is one column to the left compared to the original
- It still maintains a valid path from P to G
- The overall "L" shape of the corridors is preserved
- The maze dimensions are the same (7x7)
- The walls and empty spaces are distributed differently while maintaining the basic "L" shape concept
