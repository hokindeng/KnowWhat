You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- Current position 'P' is at (0,0)
- Goal position 'G' is at (1,4)
- I need to find a path from P to G through empty spaces (0s)

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach G, I need to:
1. Move right along the top row until I can reach G
2. G is in the second row, so I'll need to move down when I'm above it

For my first move, I'll move right from (0,0) to (0,1), as this is an empty space and brings me closer to the goal.

I choose coordinates: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving right along the top row, as this is the path that will lead me to be above the goal position.

From my current position at (0,1), I'll move right to (0,2).

I choose coordinates: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing with the same strategy, I'll keep moving right along the top row to get above the goal position.

From my current position at (0,2), I'll move right to (0,3).

I choose coordinates: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at (0,3), and I can see that the goal 'G' is at (1,4). I need to move one more space to the right to be directly above the goal position.

From my current position at (0,3), I'll move right to (0,4).

I choose coordinates: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm directly above the goal position. I'm at (0,4) and the goal is at (1,4).

The final move is to move down one space to reach the goal.

From my current position at (0,4), I'll move down to (1,4).

I choose coordinates: (1,4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

1. The empty spaces (corridors) form a general "T" shape. There's a horizontal corridor along the top row and a vertical corridor down the middle of the maze.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "T" shape pattern but with a slightly different arrangement:

P 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The horizontal part of the T is along the top row
- The vertical part of the T extends down from the middle
- P and G are still connected by a valid path
- The overall T shape is maintained but with different wall placements
- The maze has the same dimensions as the original
