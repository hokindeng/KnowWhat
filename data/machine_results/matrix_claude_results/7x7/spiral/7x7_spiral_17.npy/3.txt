You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- Current position 'P' is at (0,0)
- Goal position 'G' is at (1,4)
- I need to find a path from P to G through empty spaces (0s)

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach G, I need to:
1. Move right along the top row until I can reach G
2. G is in the second row, so I'll need to move down when I'm above it

For my first move, I'll move right from (0,0) to (0,1), as this is an empty space and brings me closer to the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving right along the top row to get closer to the goal position at (1,4).

From my current position at (0,1), I'll move right to (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving right along the top row to get closer to the goal position at (1,4).

From my current position at (0,2), I'll move right to (0,3).

My next move coordinates are: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving right along the top row. From my current position at (0,3), I'll move right to (0,4), which will position me directly above the goal 'G'.

My next move coordinates are: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm directly above the goal position, I can move down to reach it.

From my current position at (0,4), I'll move down to (1,4), which is the goal position 'G'.

My next move coordinates are: (1,4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a general "T" shape, with the top horizontal line along row 0 and a vertical line descending from the middle.

Here's my new maze design that maintains a "T" shape pattern of empty spaces:

P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This maze:
1. Has the same 7x7 dimensions
2. Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
3. Is different from the original maze
4. Maintains a "T" shape formed by the corridors:
   - The top horizontal line of the T is along the first row
   - The vertical line of the T runs down from the middle
   - The shape is still clearly recognizable as a T
