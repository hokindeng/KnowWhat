You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
0 G 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal 'G'.

Current position 'P' is at (5,5)
Goal position 'G' is at (6,1)

Looking at the maze, I need to move up first to eventually reach the goal. The best path will be to go up through the empty spaces, then left, and finally down to reach 'G'.

For my first move, I'll move up from (5,5) to (4,5).

My next move coordinates are: (4,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 G 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I need to continue moving up to reach the empty path that will lead me to the goal.

From my current position at (4,5), I'll move up to (3,5).

My next move coordinates are: (3,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 P 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 G 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,5), I need to continue moving up to reach the path that will lead to the goal.

I'll move up to (2,5).

My next move coordinates are: (2,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 P 1
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 G 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,5), I need to move left to start making my way towards the goal.

I'll move left to (2,4).

My next move coordinates are: (2,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
0 G 0 0 0 0 1

1) The empty spaces form a general "U" shape, with one vertical corridor on each side connected by a horizontal corridor at the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size that maintains a "U" shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 G 0 0 0 0 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Maintains a U-shaped corridor pattern
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze
- The empty spaces clearly form a U shape
