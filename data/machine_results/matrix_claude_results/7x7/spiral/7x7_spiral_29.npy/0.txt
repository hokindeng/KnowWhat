You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

Current observations:
- The player (P) is at position (5,3)
- The goal (G) is at position (1,3)
- We need to move upward through the maze to reach the goal

For my next move, I want to move up from the current position (5,3) to (4,3).

However, I can see that position (4,3) is blocked by a wall (1), so I'll need to go around. Looking at the available paths, I can see empty spaces to the left and right of the current position.

I'll choose to move left to position (5,2).

My next move coordinates are: (5,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (5,2). Looking at the maze:
- I need to reach the goal at (1,3)
- I can see there's an empty path going upward from my current position
- Moving up is the best direction as it brings me closer to the goal

I'll move up from (5,2) to (4,2).

However, I can see that position (4,2) has a wall, so I need to move up through the empty space at (3,2).

My next move coordinates are: (4,2)

Oh, I apologize - I made a mistake in my analysis. Looking at the maze again, I can move directly up to position (4,2) as it's actually an empty space (0).

My next move coordinates are: (4,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "U" shape. The corridors create a path that goes down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side, forming a U-shaped pattern.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a U-shaped corridor pattern but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions as the original (7x7)
- Maintains a U-shaped corridor pattern
- Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original maze but preserves the general U shape
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
