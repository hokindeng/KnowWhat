You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,3)
2. Goal 'G' is at (4,0)
3. I need to find a path from P to G moving through empty spaces (0s)

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach G, I need to:
1. Move left towards the open path
2. Eventually make my way down to the bottom
3. Move left to reach G

For my first move, I'll move left from (2,3) to (2,2).

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving left to reach the open path that leads down to the goal.

From my current position at (2,2), I'll move left to (2,1).

My next move coordinates are: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving left to reach the leftmost open path.

From my current position at (2,1), I'll move left to (2,0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've reached the leftmost column, I'll move down towards the goal.

From my current position at (2,0), I'll move down to (3,0).

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
P 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now just one step away from the goal.

From my current position at (3,0), I'll move down to (4,0) to reach the goal 'G'.

My next move coordinates are: (4,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a general "U" shape, with one vertical corridor on the left side and another on the right side, connected by a horizontal corridor at the top.

Here's my new maze design that maintains this "U" shape pattern:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

This new maze:
1. Has the same 7x7 dimensions
2. Maintains the "U" shape of corridors
3. Has a valid path from P to G
4. Is different from the original maze but recognizably has the same general shape
5. Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for paths, P for start, G for goal)

The main differences from the original are:
- The starting position P is moved up
- Some internal walls are rearranged
- The horizontal part of the U is slightly lower
But the fundamental U-shaped corridor system remains intact.
