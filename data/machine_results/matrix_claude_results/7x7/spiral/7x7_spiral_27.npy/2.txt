You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,3)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (4,0)
3. I need to find a path through empty spaces ('0')

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach the goal, I need to move left first to access the path that leads to 'G'.

For my next move, I will move left from (2,3) to (2,2).

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. My current position 'P' is at (2,2)
2. The goal 'G' is at (4,0)
3. I need to continue moving left to reach the path that leads to the goal

For my next move, I will move left from (2,2) to (2,1).

My next move coordinates are: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. My current position 'P' is at (2,1)
2. The goal 'G' is at (4,0)
3. I need to continue moving left to reach the path that leads to the goal

For my next move, I will move left from (2,1) to (2,0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. My current position 'P' is at (2,0)
2. The goal 'G' is at (4,0)
3. I can now move down to reach the goal

For my next move, I will move down from (2,0) to (3,0).

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. My current position 'P' is at (3,0)
2. The goal 'G' is at (4,0)
3. I'm now just one step away from the goal

For my next move, I will move down from (3,0) to (4,0) to reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (4,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 1 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

1) The empty spaces form a general "U" shape, with one vertical corridor on the left side connected to a horizontal corridor at the bottom, and another vertical corridor on the right side.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a "U" shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 G 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms a U-shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
