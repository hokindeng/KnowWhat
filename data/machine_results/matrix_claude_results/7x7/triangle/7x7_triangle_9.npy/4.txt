You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 G 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The player (P) is at position (1,3)
- The goal (G) is at position (1,5)
- There's a clear path from P to G through the empty spaces (0s)

Since we can move in any direction including diagonals, and there's a direct path to the goal through empty spaces, I'll move directly right towards the goal.

My next move should be to position (1,4), which is the empty space between P and G.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P G 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (1,4) and the goal (G) is right next to me at (1,5). Since there's a direct path to the goal, I'll move right one space.

My next move should be to position (1,5), which is the goal position (G).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces (0s) in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape, with one corridor extending horizontally and another vertically.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also contains an "L" shaped corridor, but with a different arrangement while maintaining valid start and goal positions:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces still form an "L" shape
- There's a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The layout is different from the original but maintains the same general shape
- The maze dimensions are the same (7x7)
- The walls (1s) ensure the path maintains the "L" shape
