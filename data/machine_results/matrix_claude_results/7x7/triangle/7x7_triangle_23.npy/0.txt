You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 P 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (3,4)
Goal position 'G' is at (0,5)

Looking at the available moves from the current position:
- Can move left to (3,3) - empty space
- Can move up-left to (2,3) - empty space
- Can move up to (2,4) - wall
- Can move down to (4,4) - wall
- Can move down-left to (4,3) - empty space

Since we need to get to the goal which is at the bottom-left of the maze, we should move towards that direction. The best next move would be to go left to coordinate (3,3).

I choose to move to coordinate: (3,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (3,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (0,5)

Looking at the available moves from the current position:
- Can move left to (3,2) - empty space
- Can move up to (2,3) - empty space
- Can move down to (4,3) - empty space
- Can move down-left to (4,2) - wall
- Can move up-left to (2,2) - wall

Since we need to reach the goal at the bottom-left, we should continue moving in that general direction. Moving left to (3,2) would be the best choice as it brings us closer to our goal.

I choose to move to coordinate: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (3,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (0,5)

Looking at the available moves from the current position:
- Can move left to (3,1) - wall
- Can move right to (3,3) - empty space (but this would be going backwards)
- Can move up to (2,2) - wall
- Can move down to (4,2) - wall
- Can move down-left to (4,1) - empty space

Since we need to reach the goal at the bottom-left, and we can't move directly left, the best option is to move down-left to (4,1), which will help us get closer to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (4,1)
Goal position 'G' is at (0,5)

Looking at the available moves from the current position:
- Can move left to (4,0) - wall
- Can move right to (4,2) - wall
- Can move up to (3,1) - wall
- Can move down to (5,1) - empty space
- Can move down-left to (5,0) - goal position

Since we can reach the goal position directly from here, we should move down-left to (5,0) where 'G' is located.

I choose to move to coordinate: (5,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), with one segment going horizontally at the top, a diagonal segment in the middle, and another horizontal segment at the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern with its empty spaces, but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions as the original (7x7)
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms a "Z" shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
