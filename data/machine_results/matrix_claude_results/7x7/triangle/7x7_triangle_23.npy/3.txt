You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 P 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (3,4)
Goal position 'G' is at (0,5)

Looking at the available moves from the current position:
- Can move left to (3,3)
- Can move up-left to (2,3)
- Can move down-left to (3,5)

Since the goal is at the bottom-left of the maze, I should move towards that direction. The best move would be to go down-left to coordinate (3,5).

I choose to move to coordinate: (3,5)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 P 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1) The empty spaces form a rough "Y" shape, with the bottom of the Y connecting to the left edge where the goal is.

2) Here's a new maze with the same size and a similar Y-shaped corridor pattern:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
G 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Maintains the Y-shape pattern of corridors
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Has different specific wall placements while keeping the general Y shape
- Is the same 7x7 size as the original
