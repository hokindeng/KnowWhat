You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position (P) is at (1,4)
Goal position (G) is at (4,2)

Looking at the available moves:
- We can move to empty spaces (0)
- We need to get closer to G
- The most efficient path would be moving southwest towards G

I can see there's an empty space (0) at (1,5) and another at (2,3) that could help create a path to G.

For the first move, I recommend moving to (2,3) - this diagonal move southwest gets us closer to the goal while staying on empty spaces.

My next move coordinates are: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current position (P) is at (2,3)
Goal position (G) is at (4,2)

Looking at the available moves:
- We can move to empty spaces (0)
- We need to continue moving towards G
- There's an empty space at (3,2) that will get us closer to G

The best move would be to go to (3,2), moving southwest again. This continues our path towards the goal while staying on empty spaces.

My next move coordinates are: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 1 0 1
1 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current position (P) is at (3,2)
Goal position (G) is at (4,2)

Looking at the available moves:
- We can move to empty spaces (0)
- The goal G is directly below us
- We can move straight down to reach G

The obvious best move is to move directly down to the goal position at (4,2).

My next move coordinates are: (4,2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces (0s) in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape, with the path starting at the top right, moving diagonally down to the middle, and then continuing to the bottom left area.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern with its empty spaces, but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 P 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The "Z" shape is still present but slightly modified
- There's still a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- The overall dimensions are maintained (7x7)
- The walls (1s) still form boundaries around the "Z" pattern
- The maze is different from the original but maintains the same general shape concept
