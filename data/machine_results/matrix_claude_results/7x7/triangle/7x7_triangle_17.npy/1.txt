You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position (P) is at (1,4)
Goal position (G) is at (4,2)

Looking at the available moves:
- We can move to empty spaces (0)
- We need to get closer to G
- The most efficient path would be moving southwest towards G

I can see there's an empty space (0) at (1,5) and another at (2,3) that could help create a path to G.

For the first move, I recommend moving to coordinates (2,3) - moving diagonally southwest. This will get us closer to the goal while using an available empty space.

My next move: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:
- Current position (P) is at (2,3)
- Goal position (G) is at (4,2)
- We need to continue moving towards G

From our current position, we can move to:
- (3,2) which is an empty space and gets us closer to G

Moving to (3,2) is the best choice as it continues our path towards the goal while using available empty spaces.

My next move: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 1 0 1
1 0 G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:
- Current position (P) is at (3,2)
- Goal position (G) is at (4,2)
- We're now directly above the goal

From our current position, we can simply move down one space to reach the goal position.

Moving to (4,2) will complete the maze by reaching G.

My next move: (4,2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape. The path starts at the top right, moves diagonally down to the middle, and then continues to the bottom left area where the goal is located.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a slightly different arrangement while maintaining the same general pattern:

1 1 1 1 P 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The "Z" shape is still present
- P and G are positioned to create a valid path
- The empty spaces create a similar diagonal movement pattern
- The overall structure is different from the original while maintaining the "Z" shape concept
- The path from P to G is achievable through empty spaces

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
