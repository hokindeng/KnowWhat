You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal 'G'.

Current position 'P' is at (5,5)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,3)

Looking at the maze, I need to move diagonally up and left to reach the goal. The best first move would be to move one step up and left diagonally to coordinate (4,4).

I choose to move to: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

Current position 'P' is at (4,4)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,3)

I need to continue moving upward and slightly left to reach the goal. The best next move is to go one step up to coordinate (3,3).

I choose to move to: (3,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

Current position 'P' is at (3,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,3)

I'm now directly below the goal position. The simplest move is to go straight up to reach the goal at coordinate (2,3).

I choose to move to: (2,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) In the original maze, the empty spaces form a "T" shape, with the vertical line of the T running down the middle and the horizontal line near the top.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a T shape but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions (7x7)
- Forms a T shape with empty spaces
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze
- The vertical line of the T is straight down the middle
- The horizontal line of the T is at the top
- Both P and G are reachable through the empty spaces
