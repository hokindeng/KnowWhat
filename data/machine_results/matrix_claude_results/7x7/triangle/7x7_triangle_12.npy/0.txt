You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal 'G'.

Current position 'P' is at (5,5)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,3)

Looking at the maze, I need to move diagonally up and left to reach the goal. The best first move would be to move one step up and left diagonally to coordinate (4,4).

I choose to move to: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,4), I need to continue moving up towards the goal at (2,3).

Looking at the available paths, I can move one step up to coordinate (3,4).

I choose to move to: (3,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "Y" shape (or a fork shape), with the bottom part being the stem and two branches splitting at the top.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a Y shape but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The Y shape is still present but slightly more compact
- The stem of the Y starts at P (4,3)
- The Y branches out into two paths at the top
- One branch leads to G (1,3)
- The shape is still recognizable as a Y while being different from the original maze
- All empty spaces are connected and form a valid path from P to G
