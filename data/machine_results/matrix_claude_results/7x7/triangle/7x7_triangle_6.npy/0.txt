You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 P
1 1 1 G 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- Current position 'P' is at (1,6)
- Goal position 'G' is at (2,3)
- I need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls

Since I can move diagonally and there's a clear diagonal path to the goal, I'll move diagonally down-left towards 'G'.

My next move should be to (2,5), which is one step diagonally down-left from the current position.

I choose coordinates: 2,5

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 P
1 1 1 G 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1) The empty spaces form a rough "L" shape, rotated 90 degrees clockwise, with the long part of the L along the top of the maze and the short part descending on the right side.

2) Here's a new maze with the same rotated "L" shape pattern:

0 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The rotated L-shape is preserved
- P and G are still connected via empty spaces
- The maze has the same dimensions
- The pattern is different from the original while maintaining the general L shape
