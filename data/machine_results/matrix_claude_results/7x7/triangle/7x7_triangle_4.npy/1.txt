You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (2,2)
3. We need to move upward to reach the goal
4. We can move diagonally, which makes the solution simpler

Since we can move diagonally and there's a clear path upward, the best next move would be to move directly up to position (3,2).

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm one step closer to the goal.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (3,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (2,2)
3. We can move directly upward to reach the goal

The optimal move is to move straight up to the goal position.

I choose to move to coordinates: (2,2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "T" shape, with the vertical line of the T running from top to bottom in column 2, and the horizontal line of the T spanning across row 4.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a T shape, but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical line of the T is still in column 2
- The horizontal line of the T is now in row 4
- The player (P) starts at the top of the T
- The goal (G) is at the right end of the horizontal line
- The shape is still clearly recognizable as a T
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
