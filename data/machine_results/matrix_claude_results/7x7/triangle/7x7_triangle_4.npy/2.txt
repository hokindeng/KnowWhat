You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. Player position (P) is at (2,4) (counting from 0, going right for x and down for y)
2. Goal position (G) is at (2,2)
3. We need to move upward to reach the goal

The most direct path would be to move up, so I recommend moving to coordinates (2,3).

My next move: (2,3)

This will move the player one step up, getting closer to the goal position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze, they form a "T" shape. The vertical line of the T runs from the bottom to the middle, and the horizontal line spans across the middle.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a T-shape pattern with its empty spaces, but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical line of the T runs up from P to the horizontal line
- The horizontal line of the T spans across the top portion
- The shape is still recognizable as a T
- There is a valid path from P to G
- The maze has the same dimensions as the original
- The pattern is different from the original while maintaining the T shape
