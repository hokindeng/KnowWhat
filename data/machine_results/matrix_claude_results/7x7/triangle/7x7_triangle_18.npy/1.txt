You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the optimal path from P to G.

Current position (P) is at (4,4)
Goal position (G) is at (1,1)

Looking at the maze, I need to move diagonally up and left through the empty spaces (0s) to reach G.

For my next move, I'll move diagonally up-left to coordinate (3,3).

My next move coordinates are: (3,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (1,1).

Looking at the available paths, I can move diagonally up-left again through the empty space to coordinate (2,2).

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,2), I can now move directly to the goal position at (1,1).

My next move coordinates are: (1,1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) In the original maze, the empty spaces (corridors) form an "L" shape.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions (7x7)
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms an "L" shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze (simpler path, fewer empty spaces)
- Maintains the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
