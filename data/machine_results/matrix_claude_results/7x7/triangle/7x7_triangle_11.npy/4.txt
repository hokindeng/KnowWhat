You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- Current position 'P' is at (1,4) - counting from 0, where first number is x-coordinate (column) and second is y-coordinate (row)
- Goal 'G' is at (4,5)
- I need to navigate through empty spaces ('0') to reach the goal

Looking at the available paths, I can see that I need to move up first to access the path that will lead to the goal.

For my next move, I want to move up to coordinates (1,3), which is currently marked as '0'.

I choose coordinates: 1,3

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "U" shape, with one vertical corridor on the left side and another shorter vertical segment on the right, connected by a horizontal passage at the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "U" shape pattern of empty spaces but with slightly different wall placements:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The left vertical corridor is preserved but slightly modified
- The right vertical segment is moved one column to the right
- The horizontal bottom connector is maintained
- P and G positions are adjusted but still connected by a valid path
- The overall "U" shape of the corridors is maintained while being distinct from the original maze
