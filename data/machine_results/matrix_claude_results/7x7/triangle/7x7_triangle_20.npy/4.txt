You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (2,5)
3. There are empty spaces (0) that create a path between P and G
4. We can move in any direction, including diagonally

Looking at the available paths, I can see that we can move directly to the right through the empty space at (2,3).

I choose to move to coordinates (2,3).

This move will:
1. Keep us on a direct path toward the goal
2. Use an available empty space
3. Maintain maximum flexibility for subsequent moves

Please move the player (P) to coordinates (2,3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), starting from the left, moving right, then diagonally down-left, and finally right again to reach the goal.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern with its empty spaces, but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 P 0 1 G 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The "Z" shape is still present but slightly shifted
- There's still a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
- The overall pattern is recognizable as a "Z" but with its own unique arrangement of empty spaces
- The border walls are preserved
- Both P and G positions are connected by a continuous path of empty spaces

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
