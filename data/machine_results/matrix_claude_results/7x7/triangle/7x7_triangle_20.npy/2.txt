You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (2,5)
3. There are empty spaces (0) that create a path between P and G

Looking at the available moves from the current position (2,2), I can move:
- Right to (2,3)
- Diagonally up-right to (1,3)
- Up to (1,2)
- Diagonally up-left to (1,1)
- Left to (2,1)
- Diagonally down-left to (3,1)
- Down to (3,2)
- Diagonally down-right to (3,3)

The most efficient path to reach G would be to move to the right, as this brings us closer to the goal.

I choose to move to position (2,3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), with one horizontal corridor at the top, a diagonal section in the middle, and another horizontal corridor at the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern with its empty spaces, but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The "Z" shape is still present but slightly compressed
- There's a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
- The pattern is different from the original but maintains the same general "Z" shape concept
- The walls (1s) still form a valid boundary around the path
