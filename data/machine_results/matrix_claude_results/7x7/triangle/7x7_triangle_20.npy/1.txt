You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (2,5)
3. There are empty spaces (0) that create a path between P and G
4. We can move in any direction, including diagonally

Looking at the available paths, I can see that we can move directly to the right through the empty space at (2,3).

I choose to move to coordinates (2,3).

This move will:
1. Keep us on a direct path toward the goal
2. Use an available empty space
3. Make progress toward our destination

Please move the player (P) to coordinates (2,3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

(1) The empty spaces form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern).

(2) Here's a new maze with a similar Z-shaped pattern but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Maintains the same 7x7 dimensions
- Creates a Z-shaped path from P to G
- Uses a different positioning than the original
- Preserves the zigzag pattern characteristic of a Z shape
- Provides a valid solution path through empty spaces
