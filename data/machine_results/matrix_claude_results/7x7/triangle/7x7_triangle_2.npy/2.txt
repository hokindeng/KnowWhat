You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 G 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. Player position (P) is at (5,3)
2. Goal (G) is at (5,5)
3. There's a path of empty spaces (0s) that can lead to the goal

Looking at the available moves from the current position (5,3):
- Up: blocked by wall (1)
- Right: blocked by wall (1)
- Down: can move to empty space (0)
- Left: blocked by wall (1)
- Diagonal down-right: can move to empty space (0)

The best move would be to move diagonally down and right to position (6,4), as this brings us closer to the goal while staying on empty spaces.

I choose to move to coordinates: (6,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 0 0 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. Player position (P) is at (6,4)
2. Goal (G) is at (5,5)
3. There are empty spaces (0s) leading to the goal

Looking at the available moves from the current position (6,4):
- Up: blocked by wall (1)
- Right: can move to empty space (0)
- Left: can move to empty space (0)
- Diagonal up-right: can move to empty space (0)

The best move would be to move right to position (6,5), as this brings us closer to the goal while staying on empty spaces.

I choose to move to coordinates: (6,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. Player position (P) is at (6,5)
2. Goal (G) is at (5,5)
3. We're now directly below the goal

From the current position (6,5), we can move:
- Up: This leads directly to the goal (G)
- Left: empty space (0)
- Right: empty space (0)

The obvious best move is to move up to reach the goal position.

I choose to move to coordinates: (5,5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape (or an inverted "L" shape, depending on perspective).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shape pattern of empty spaces, but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces still form an "L" shape
- There's a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The maze has different wall placements while maintaining the same general shape pattern
- The size is 7x7, matching the original
- The "L" shape is rotated 90 degrees compared to the original, but still maintains the characteristic L-shaped corridor pattern
