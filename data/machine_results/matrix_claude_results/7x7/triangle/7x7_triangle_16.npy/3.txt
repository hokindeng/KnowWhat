You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,3)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,3)
3. There is a clear vertical path downward from P to G

Since there is a direct path to the goal, the optimal next move would be to move one step down towards G.

I choose to move to coordinates: (5,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I can see that I'm now at position (5,3) and just one step away from the goal (G) at (6,3).

The path is clear - I can move directly down to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (6,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "T" shape, with the vertical line running from the middle top to bottom, and a horizontal line near the bottom of the maze.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a "T" shape with its corridors, but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical line of the T is centered
- The horizontal line is one row higher than in the original
- P and G are still connected by a valid path
- The overall T shape is preserved but with different proportions
- The maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions as the original
