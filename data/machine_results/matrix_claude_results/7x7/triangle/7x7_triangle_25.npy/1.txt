You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (3,6)
Goal position 'G' is at (5,4)

Looking at the available paths, I need to move towards the goal while staying on empty spaces ('0'). The most direct path would be to move diagonally to the left and down.

I'll move to coordinates (4,5), which is one step diagonally down-left from the current position.

My next move: (4,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 P 1
1 1 1 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (4,5)
Goal position 'G' is at (5,4)

I need to reach the goal 'G', and I can see that I need to move through the empty spaces to get there. From my current position, I should move to the empty space that's directly to the left of the goal.

I'll move to coordinates (4,3), which is two spaces to the left of my current position.

My next move: (4,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "T" shape. The vertical line of the T runs from top to bottom in column 3, and the horizontal line spans across rows 3 and 4.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a T-shape with its empty spaces, but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical line of the T runs down column 3
- The horizontal line of the T spans across row 3
- P and G are placed at opposite ends of the T
- The path between P and G is valid and traversable through empty spaces
- The overall T shape is maintained but with different proportions than the original
