You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 G 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The player (P) is at position (1,3)
- The goal (G) is at position (1,5)
- There's a clear path from P to G through the empty spaces (0s)

Since we can move in any direction including diagonals, and the goal is directly to the right of our current position with an empty space between them, the most efficient move would be to move one step to the right.

I choose to move to coordinates (1,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P G 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now the player (P) is at position (1,4) and the goal (G) is at position (1,5), directly to the right of the current position.

Since we can move directly to the goal position and there are no walls between us and the goal, I choose to move to coordinates (1,5) to reach the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces (0s) in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape, with one corridor extending horizontally and another vertically.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an "L" shape but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The horizontal part of the "L" is along the top
- The vertical part extends downward
- There's still a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The shape is clearly an "L" but arranged differently from the original
- The maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions
