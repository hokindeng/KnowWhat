You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 0 0 0 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (6,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,6)
3. There's a path of empty spaces leading to the goal

Looking at the available moves from the current position (6,2), I can move:
- Right to (6,3)
- Diagonally up-right to (5,3)

Since the goal is to the right, and we need to eventually move rightward to reach it, I'll choose to move right to position (6,3).

My next move coordinates are: (6,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 P 0 0 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6,3), I can see that I need to continue moving right to reach the goal at (6,6).

Looking at the available moves from (6,3), I can move:
- Right to (6,4)
- Diagonally up-right to (5,4)

Since there's a clear path to the right leading to the goal, I'll continue moving right to position (6,4).

My next move coordinates are: (6,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 P 0 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6,4), I can continue moving right towards the goal at (6,6).

Looking at the available moves from (6,4), I can move:
- Right to (6,5)
- Diagonally up-right to (5,5)

Since there's a clear path to the right leading to the goal, I'll continue moving right to position (6,5).

My next move coordinates are: (6,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 0 P G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6,5), I can make the final move to reach the goal at (6,6).

Looking at the available moves from (6,5), I can move:
- Right to (6,6), which is where the goal (G) is located

This will be the final move to complete the maze.

My next move coordinates are: (6,6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape, with a vertical segment coming down from the middle and then turning right at the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an "L" shape but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 G

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions (7x7)
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms an "L" shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
