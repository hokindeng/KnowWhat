You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 0 0 0 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (6,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,6)
3. There's a path of empty spaces (0s) that leads to the goal
4. We can move in any direction (including diagonals)

Looking at the maze, we can move either:
- Up to (5,2)
- Right to (6,3)
- Diagonally up-right to (5,3)

The most efficient path to reach the goal would be to move towards the right, as that brings us closer to the goal position.

I choose to move to position (6,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 P 0 0 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. The player (P) is now at position (6,3)
2. The goal (G) is still at position (6,6)
3. We need to continue moving right through the empty spaces

From the current position, we can move:
- Right to (6,4)
- Diagonally up-right to (5,4)

Since we want to reach the goal which is to the right, and there's a clear path of empty spaces leading to it, the most efficient move would be to continue moving right.

I choose to move to position (6,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 P 0 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. The player (P) is now at position (6,4)
2. The goal (G) is still at position (6,6)
3. We're getting closer to the goal

From the current position, we can move:
- Right to (6,5)
- Diagonally up-right to (5,5)

Since we want to reach the goal which is to the right, and there's a clear path of empty spaces leading to it, the most efficient move would be to continue moving right.

I choose to move to position (6,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 0 P G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. The player (P) is now at position (6,5)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,6)
3. We're just one step away from the goal!

From the current position, we can move:
- Right to (6,6), which is the goal position

This is our final move to reach the goal.

I choose to move to position (6,6).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) Looking at the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape, with the vertical part of the L extending from top to bottom and the horizontal part extending to the right at the bottom.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shape pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 G

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions as the original (7x7)
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms an "L" shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape pattern
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
