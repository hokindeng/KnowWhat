You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 0 0 0 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (6,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,6)
3. There's a path of empty spaces leading to the goal

Looking at the available moves from the current position (6,2), I can move:
- Right to (6,3)
- Diagonally up-right to (5,3)

Since the goal is to the right, and we want to make progress towards it, the best move would be to move right to position (6,3).

I choose to move to coordinates: (6,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 P 0 0 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6,3), I can see that I need to continue moving towards the goal on the right.

Available moves from current position (6,3):
- Right to (6,4)
- Diagonally up-right to (5,4)

Since there's a clear path to the right leading to the goal, and it's the most direct route, I'll move right to position (6,4).

I choose to move to coordinates: (6,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 P 0 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6,4), I can continue moving towards the goal on the right.

Available moves from current position (6,4):
- Right to (6,5)
- Diagonally up-right to (5,5)

Since there's a clear path to the right leading to the goal, and it's the most direct route, I'll move right to position (6,5).

I choose to move to coordinates: (6,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 0 P G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6,5), I can reach the goal with one final move to the right.

Available moves from current position (6,5):
- Right to (6,6), which is the goal position (G)

This is the final move needed to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (6,6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape (or reversed "7" shape), with a vertical corridor going down and then a horizontal corridor going right.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shaped path but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 G

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions (7x7)
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms an "L" shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for paths, P for start, G for goal)

The "L" shape is formed by a short horizontal corridor at the top and a vertical corridor that goes down before turning right to reach the goal.
