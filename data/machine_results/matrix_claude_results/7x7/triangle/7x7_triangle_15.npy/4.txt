You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

Current position 'P' is at (1,4)
Goal position 'G' is at (5,0)

To reach the goal, I need to move towards the left and down. Looking at the available paths, I can see empty spaces ('0') that will help me reach the goal.

For my next move, I'll move diagonally left and down to position (2,3), which is marked as '0'. This will help me progress towards the goal while staying on valid paths.

I choose coordinates: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 P 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current position 'P' is at (2,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (5,0)

I need to continue moving towards the left and down to reach the goal. Looking at the available paths, I can see there's an empty space ('0') at (3,2) that will help me progress.

I'll move diagonally left and down to position (3,2).

I choose coordinates: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 P 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current position 'P' is at (3,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (5,0)

I need to continue moving towards the left and down to reach the goal. Looking at the available paths, I can see there's an empty space ('0') at (4,1) that will help me progress.

I'll move diagonally left and down to position (4,1).

I choose coordinates: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 P 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current position 'P' is at (4,1)
Goal position 'G' is at (5,0)

I'm now very close to the goal. There's an empty path directly to the goal position. I can move diagonally left and down to reach the goal at (5,0).

I choose coordinates: (5,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape, with one segment running vertically along the left side and another segment running horizontally along the top.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shaped corridor but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The horizontal part of the "L" is along the bottom instead of the top
- The vertical part is still along the left side
- The path from P to G is still valid and follows the L-shape
- The overall shape of the corridors is still clearly an "L"
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
- The encoding follows the same rules (1 for walls, 0 for corridors, P for start, G for goal)
