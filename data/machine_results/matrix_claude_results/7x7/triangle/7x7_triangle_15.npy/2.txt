You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

Current position 'P' is at (1,4)
Goal position 'G' is at (5,0)

To reach the goal, I need to move towards the left and down. Looking at the available paths, I can see empty spaces ('0') that will help me reach the goal.

For my next move, I'll move diagonally left and down to position (2,3), which is marked as '0'. This will help me progress towards the goal while staying on valid paths.

I choose coordinates: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 P 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current position 'P' is at (2,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (5,0)

I need to continue moving towards the left and down to reach the goal. Looking at the available paths, I can see there's an empty space ('0') at (3,2) that will help me progress.

I'll move diagonally left and down to position (3,2).

I choose coordinates: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 P 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current position 'P' is at (3,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (5,0)

I need to continue moving towards the left and down to reach the goal. Looking at the available paths, I can see there's an empty space ('0') at (4,1) that will help me progress.

I'll move diagonally left and down to position (4,1).

I choose coordinates: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 P 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current position 'P' is at (4,1)
Goal position 'G' is at (5,0)

I need to make my final move to reach the goal. From my current position, I can see the goal 'G' is directly diagonally down and left at (5,0).

I'll move diagonally left and down to reach the goal position.

I choose coordinates: (5,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a (1) "Z" shape.

Here's (2) my new maze with empty spaces forming a Z shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is not identical to the original maze
- Forms a clear Z shape with its corridors
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)

The Z shape is maintained but rotated slightly differently from the original, and the path is still navigable from P to G.
