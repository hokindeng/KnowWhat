You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (3,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (4,5)

Looking at the available paths:
- Moving directly east is blocked by a wall
- Moving northeast leads to an empty space at (2,4)
- Moving southeast leads to an empty space at (4,4)

Since we need to reach the goal at (4,5), and there's an empty path leading that way, I'll choose to move southeast to position (4,4).

My next move coordinates are: (4,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1) The empty spaces form a general "Y" shape, with:
- One vertical corridor on the right side
- One horizontal corridor at the bottom
- A diagonal corridor connecting from the middle to the right side

2) Here's a new maze with a similar "Y" shape but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 G 1
1 0 0 1 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze maintains the Y-shaped corridor system but with:
- A slightly different vertical corridor placement
- A modified horizontal bottom section
- A different angle for the diagonal connection
- Different but valid P and G positions

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
