You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (3,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (4,5)

Looking at the available paths:
- Moving directly east is blocked by a wall
- Moving northeast leads to an empty space at (2,4)
- Moving southeast leads to an empty space at (4,4)

Since we need to reach the goal at (4,5), and there's an empty path leading that way, I'll choose to move northeast to position (2,4).

My next move coordinates are: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (2,4)
Goal position 'G' is at (4,5)

Looking at the available paths:
- Moving east leads to an empty space at (2,5)
- Moving southeast leads to an empty space at (3,5)

Since we need to reach the goal at (4,5), and moving east and then south would create a clear path to the goal, I'll choose to move east to position (2,5).

My next move coordinates are: (2,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 P 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (2,5)
Goal position 'G' is at (4,5)

Looking at the available paths:
- Moving south leads to an empty space at (3,5)
- This will put us directly above the goal

Since we need to reach the goal at (4,5), and there's a clear vertical path to it, I'll move south to position (3,5).

My next move coordinates are: (3,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 P 1
1 1 0 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (3,5)
Goal position 'G' is at (4,5)

The solution is simple now - we're directly above the goal position. We just need to move south one space to reach it.

My next move coordinates are: (4,5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a rough "Z" shape, with the path starting from the top right, moving diagonally down to the middle, and then extending to the bottom right.

Here's my new maze design that maintains a "Z" shape pattern:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 1 G 1
1 0 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
1. Has the same 7x7 dimensions
2. Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
3. Is different from the original maze
4. Maintains a "Z" shape in its corridors, with:
   - A horizontal segment at the top
   - A diagonal middle section
   - A horizontal segment at the bottom
5. Is fully enclosed by walls (1s) on the perimeter

The path from P to G is still feasible, and the overall "Z" shape of the corridors is preserved while being distinct from the original maze.
