You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (1, 4) - counting from top-left (0,0)
Goal position 'G' is at (3, 3)

Looking at the available moves from the current position:
- Up: blocked by wall
- Up-right: empty space (0)
- Right: empty space (0)
- Down-right: blocked by wall
- Down: blocked by wall
- Down-left: blocked by wall
- Left: empty space (0)
- Up-left: empty space (0)

The best move would be to go up-right diagonally, as this brings us closer to the goal 'G'.

I choose to move to coordinates: (2, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Y" shape, with the bottom of the Y at the current position P, and the two arms of the Y leading up, with the goal G positioned at the end of one arm.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a Y-shaped corridor pattern but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The Y shape is still present
- P is at the bottom of the Y
- G is at one of the upper branches
- The corridors are connected and allow movement from P to G
- The overall shape is similar but not identical to the original
- The maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions
