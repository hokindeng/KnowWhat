You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 P
1 1 1 0 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,6)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,6)
3. We need to move downward and find a path to reach G

Looking at the available moves from the current position (2,6):
- We can move down to (3,6), which appears to be the best option as it brings us closer to the goal

I recommend moving to coordinates (3,6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 P
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (3,6)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,6)
3. We need to continue moving downward, but we'll need to navigate through the available empty spaces

Looking at the available moves from position (3,6):
- We can move down-left to (4,5), which will help us progress towards the goal through the available path

I recommend moving to coordinates (4,5).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape - starting from the top right, moving diagonally down-left through the middle, and then continuing to the bottom right.

Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern with its empty spaces:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
1. Has the same dimensions as the original (7x7)
2. Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
3. Is different from the original maze
4. Maintains a "Z" shape with its corridors, though the Z is slightly more pronounced than in the original
5. Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
