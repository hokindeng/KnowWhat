You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,3)
2. Goal 'G' is at (4,4)
3. I need to reach G by moving through empty spaces ('0')

Looking at the available paths:
- There's an empty space to the left at (3,2)
- There's an empty space to the right at (3,4)
- There's a wall below at (4,3)
- There's an empty space above at (2,3)

To reach the goal at (4,4), I should move right first to position (3,4), and then down to the goal.

For my next move, I choose to move right to coordinates (3,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (3,4), and I can see that:
- The goal 'G' is directly below me at (4,4)
- There's a wall to my right
- There's an empty space to my left
- There's an empty space above me

Since the goal is directly below my current position, I'll move down to coordinates (4,4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a "U" shape, with the vertical parts of the U on the left and right sides, connected by a horizontal path at the bottom.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a U shape but with a different arrangement while maintaining valid P to G connectivity:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The U shape is wider but shallower than the original
- P and G are positioned at opposite ends of the U
- There's still a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The overall U shape is maintained but with different proportions
- The maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions as the original
