You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,6)
2. Goal 'G' is at (5,5)
3. I need to move towards the goal while staying on empty spaces ('0')

Looking at the available moves from my current position (4,6):
- I can move left to (4,5)
- I can move down to (5,6)

Since the goal is at (5,5), I should move left to (4,5) as this will get me closer to the goal.

My next move: (4,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,5)
2. Goal 'G' is at (5,5)
3. Available moves:
   - Up: blocked by wall
   - Down: blocked by wall (1)
   - Left: can move to (4,4)
   - Right: can move to (4,6) (but this would be going backwards)

Since I can't move directly down to the goal due to the wall at (5,5), I need to go around. The best path would be to move left to (4,4), then down to (5,4), and then right to reach the goal.

My next move: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,4)
2. Goal 'G' is at (5,5)
3. Available moves:
   - Up: blocked by wall
   - Down: can move to (5,4)
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: can move to (4,5) (but this would be going backwards)

The best move is to go down to (5,4), which will then allow me to move right to reach the goal at (5,5).

My next move: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 P 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current position 'P' is at (5,4)
2. Goal 'G' is at (5,5)
3. Available moves:
   - Up: can move to (4,4)
   - Down: can move to (6,4)
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: blocked by wall (1)

Since I can't move directly right to the goal due to the wall, I need to go down to (6,4) and then right to reach the goal.

My next move: (6,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 P G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current position 'P' is at (6,4)
2. Goal 'G' is at (6,5)
3. Available moves:
   - Up: can move to (5,4)
   - Down: blocked by wall
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: can move to (6,5) which is the goal!

I can now move right to reach the goal position.

My next move: (6,5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape (or an inverted "L" shape when viewed from top to bottom).

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different placement:

1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 G 0

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is not identical to the original maze
- Forms an "L" shape with its corridors
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
