You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,6)
2. Goal 'G' is at (5,5)
3. I need to move towards the goal while staying on empty spaces ('0')

Looking at the available moves from my current position (4,6):
- I can move left to (4,5)
- I can move down to (5,6)

Since the goal is at (5,5), the best move would be to go left to position (4,5), which will bring me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,5)
2. Goal 'G' is at (5,5)
3. Available moves:
   - Left to (4,4)
   - Down is blocked by a wall at (5,5)

Since I can't move directly down to the goal due to the wall, I need to go around it. I'll move left to (4,4), which will allow me to then move down and eventually reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,4)
2. Goal 'G' is at (5,5)
3. Available moves:
   - Down to (5,4)
   - Right to (4,5)

Since I need to get to the goal at (5,5), and there's a wall at (5,5), I need to go down first and then move right to reach the goal. Moving down to (5,4) is the best choice as it will allow me to then move right to (5,6) and finally left to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 P 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current position 'P' is at (5,4)
2. Goal 'G' is at (5,5)
3. Available moves:
   - Down to (6,4)
   - Up to (4,4)

Since I can't move directly right to the goal due to the wall at (5,5), I need to go down first and then move right to reach the goal. Moving down to (6,4) will allow me to then move right and reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (6,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 P G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current position 'P' is at (6,4)
2. Goal 'G' is at (6,5)
3. Available moves:
   - Right to (6,5)
   - Up to (5,4)

I'm now directly adjacent to the goal position. I can move right to reach it.

I choose to move to coordinates: (6,5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form an "L" shape, with one vertical corridor and one horizontal corridor meeting at a right angle.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different placement than the original:

1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions (7x7)
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms an "L" shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze (the L is larger and positioned differently)
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
