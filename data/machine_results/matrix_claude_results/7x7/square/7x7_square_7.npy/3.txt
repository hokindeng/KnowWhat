You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (1,6)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,6)
3. I can see that there's a path from P to G going down through the empty spaces (0s)

For my next move, I want to move down from (1,6) to (2,6).

I choose coordinates: (2,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 P
1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2,6) and need to reach G at (3,6). The path is clear - I can simply move down one space.

I choose coordinates: (3,6)

This move will take me directly to the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form an "L" shape.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different orientation:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is rotated 90 degrees compared to the original
- P is placed at the start of the "L" at (1,1)
- G is placed at the end of the "L" at (5,4)
- The path from P to G follows the "L" shape
- The maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions
- The empty spaces (0s) clearly form an "L" pattern
