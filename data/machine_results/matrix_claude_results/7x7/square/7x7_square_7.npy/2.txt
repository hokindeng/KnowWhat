You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The player (P) is at position (1,6)
- The goal (G) is at position (3,6)
- There are empty spaces (0) creating a path between P and G

Looking at the available moves from the current position (1,6), I can move:
- Down to (2,6)

Since the goal is below the current position and there's a clear path downward, I'll choose to move down.

My next move coordinates are: (2,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 P
1 1 1 1 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:
- The player (P) is now at position (2,6)
- The goal (G) is at position (3,6)
- I can move down to reach the goal directly

Since the goal is directly below my current position and that space is empty, I'll move down.

My next move coordinates are: (3,6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) In the original maze, the empty spaces form an "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces still form an "L" shape
- There is a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- The maze has the same 7x7 dimensions
- The arrangement is different from the original maze, with the "L" rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise
- The path goes from P, through the horizontal part of the L, then down the vertical part to G
