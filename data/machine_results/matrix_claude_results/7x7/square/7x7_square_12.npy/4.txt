You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 P 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

Current position 'P' is at (1,5)
Goal position 'G' is at (6,0)

Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to move left and then down to reach the goal. The first step should be moving left to position (1,4).

I choose to move to coordinates: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving towards the goal.

Current position 'P' is at (1,4)
Goal position 'G' is at (6,0)

I need to continue moving left to reach the leftmost column and then move down to reach the goal. Therefore, I'll move to position (1,3).

I choose to move to coordinates: (1,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) In the original maze, the empty spaces form a general "U" shape, with two vertical corridors connected by a horizontal corridor at the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "U" shape but with slightly different dimensions:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G
- Forms a "U" shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for paths, P for start, G for goal)

The main differences are:
- The right vertical corridor is shorter
- The horizontal bottom corridor is positioned one row higher
- The walls are arranged differently while maintaining the U-shaped path
