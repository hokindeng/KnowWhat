You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 P 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

Current observations:
- Player (P) is at position (1,5)
- Goal (G) is at position (6,0)
- There's a clear path along the right edge and bottom of the maze

For the next move, I should move left to begin making my way toward the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (1,4), which is one step to the left of the current position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving left to reach the leftmost column, from where I can then move down to reach the goal.

Current position is (1,4), and I'll move to (1,3), which is one step to the left.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing with the same strategy, I'll keep moving left to eventually reach the leftmost column.

Current position is (1,3), and I'll move to (1,2), which is one step to the left.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 1 1 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Almost at the leftmost column. One more step to the left.

Current position is (1,1), and I'll move to (1,0), which is one step to the left.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

G 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've reached the leftmost column, I can move down towards the goal.

Current position is (1,0), and I'll move to (2,0), which is one step down.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) The empty spaces in the original maze form an "L" shape (or inverted "L" shape, depending on orientation).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions as the original (7x7)
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms an "L" shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
