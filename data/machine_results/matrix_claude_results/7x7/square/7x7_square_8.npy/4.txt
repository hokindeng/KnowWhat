You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current player position (P) is at (2,2)
2. Goal position (G) is at (2,3)
3. I need to reach G by moving through empty spaces (0)

Looking at the maze, I can see that the shortest path to reach G is to move down one step.

I choose to move to coordinates (3,2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze, they form a "T" shape.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a "T" shape, but with a different arrangement while maintaining valid P to G connectivity:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The T shape is still present but rotated 90 degrees
- P and G are still connected via empty spaces
- The maze maintains the same dimensions
- The shape is recognizably a "T"
- The layout is different from the original while preserving the core shape concept
