You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 P
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

Current position (P) is at (4, 6)
Goal position (G) is at (1, 0)

To reach the goal, I need to move around the block of walls. Looking at the maze, I can see there's a clear path around the walls by going down, left, and then up.

For my first move, I'll move down to position (5, 6).

My next move coordinates are: (5, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0
G 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 P
0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'll move left, starting to go around the block of walls.

My next move coordinates are: (5, 5)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces (corridors) form a "U" shape around the central block of walls.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a U-shape path, but with a different arrangement:

0 0 0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0
G 1 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0

This new maze:
- Maintains the 7x7 dimensions
- Has a U-shaped corridor around a central block of walls
- Places P and G in different positions but still allows a valid path between them
- Creates the same general U-shape pattern but is not identical to the original
- The path from P to G requires going right, down, left, and then up to reach the goal
