You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,0)
2. Goal 'G' is at (5,0)
3. I need to find a path from P to G moving through empty spaces (0)

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach G, I need to:
1. Move down to reach the empty space at (4,0), but that's blocked by a wall
2. Move right to (3,1), then down and left seems to be a viable path

For my next move, I choose to move right from (3,0) to (3,1).

My next move coordinates are: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I'm now at position (3,1)
2. The goal 'G' is still at (5,0)
3. To reach G, I need to find a path through the empty spaces

From my current position (3,1), I can see that:
1. Moving right leads to an empty space
2. This will allow me to eventually move down and then left towards the goal

Therefore, I choose to move right from (3,1) to (3,2).

My next move coordinates are: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I'm now at position (3,2)
2. The goal 'G' is at (5,0)
3. I need to continue finding a path through empty spaces

From my current position (3,2), I can see that:
1. Moving down leads to an empty space
2. This will allow me to then move left towards the goal

Therefore, I choose to move down from (3,2) to (4,2).

My next move coordinates are: (4,2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I'm now at position (4,2)
2. The goal 'G' is at (5,0)
3. I need to continue finding a path through empty spaces

From my current position (4,2), I can see that:
1. Moving down leads to an empty space
2. This will get me closer to the goal, as I can then move left

Therefore, I choose to move down from (4,2) to (5,2).

My next move coordinates are: (5,2)

1. I'm now at position (5,2)
2. The goal 'G' is at (5,0)
3. I need to continue finding a path through empty spaces

From my current position (5,2), I can see that:
1. Moving left leads to an empty space
2. This will get me closer to the goal 'G'

Therefore, I choose to move left from (5,2) to (5,1).

My next move coordinates are: (5,1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I'm now at position (5,1)
2. The goal 'G' is at (5,0)
3. I'm just one step away from the goal

From my current position (5,1), I can see that:
1. Moving left leads directly to the goal 'G'
2. This is the final move needed to complete the maze

Therefore, I choose to move left from (5,1) to (5,0).

My next move coordinates are: (5,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form:

(1) A general "U" shape, with the vertical parts of the U being slightly different lengths and the bottom part forming the connection between them.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a U shape but with slightly different wall placements:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms a U shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the U-shaped pattern
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for start, G for goal)
