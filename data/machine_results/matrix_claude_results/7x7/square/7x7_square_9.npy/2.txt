You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The player (P) is at position (3,0)
- The goal (G) is at position (5,0)
- I need to find a path from P to G

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach the goal, I need to move down. The path is clear through the empty spaces ('0').

For my next move, I want to move down from position (3,0) to position (4,0).

My next move coordinates are: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1 1 1
P 1 0 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (4,0)
- The goal (G) is at position (5,0)
- I can move down to reach the goal directly

For my next move, I want to move down from position (4,0) to position (5,0) where the goal is located.

My next move coordinates are: (5,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape (or an inverted "L" shape, depending on perspective).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a slightly different arrangement while maintaining a valid path from P to G:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original maze
- Maintains an "L" shape in its corridor pattern
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
