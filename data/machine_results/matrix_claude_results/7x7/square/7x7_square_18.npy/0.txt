You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
P 0 G 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The player 'P' is at position (2,0)
- The goal 'G' is at position (2,2)
- There is a clear path through empty spaces ('0') to reach the goal

For the next move, I should move right towards the goal. Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (2,1).

My next move: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 P G 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I can see that I'm now at position (2,1) and the goal 'G' is right next to me at (2,2). Since I can move directly to the goal, I'll make my next move to coordinates (2,2).

My next move: (2,2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form an "L" shape.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement while maintaining a valid path from P to G:

P 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces still form an "L" shape
- There is a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- The layout is different from the original maze
- The size remains 7x7
- The encoding follows the same format (0 for empty spaces, 1 for walls, P for player, G for goal)
