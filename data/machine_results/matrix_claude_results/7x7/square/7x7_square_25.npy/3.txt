You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The player (P) is at position (1,3)
- The goal (G) is at position (3,3)
- I need to move down to reach the goal

Since I can move up, down, left, or right through empty spaces (0), and I need to reach the goal which is directly below the player position, I'll move down.

My next move coordinates are: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:
- The player (P) is now at position (2,3)
- The goal (G) is at position (3,3)
- I need to move down one more step to reach the goal

Since I can move down to an empty space where the goal is located, I'll make that move.

My next move coordinates are: (3,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze, they form a "T" shape. The vertical line of the T runs from top to bottom in the second column, and the horizontal line spans across positions (1,2), (1,3), and (1,4).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a T shape, but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical line of the T runs down the second column
- The horizontal line of the T spans across the top row of the open space
- P and G are placed at opposite ends of the T
- The path from P to G is still valid through empty spaces
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
- The T shape is clearly recognizable but arranged differently from the original
