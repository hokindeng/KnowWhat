You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 G 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The player 'P' is at position (2,2)
- The goal 'G' is at position (4,2)
- There is a clear path downward from P to G

For my next move, I want to move down one space towards the goal.
I choose coordinates (3,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 P 1 1 1 1
0 0 G 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I can see that I'm now at position (3,2) and the goal 'G' is just one step down at (4,2).

For my next move, I'll move down one space to reach the goal.
I choose coordinates (4,2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Y" shape, with two paths at the top merging into a single vertical path.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a Y-shape pattern with its empty spaces, but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The Y-shape is rotated compared to the original
- The two arms of the Y merge and lead to the goal
- There is still a valid path from P to G
- The overall shape of the corridors maintains the Y pattern
- The maze uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
