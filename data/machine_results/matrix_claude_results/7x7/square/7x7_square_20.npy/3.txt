You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
G 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

Current observations:
1. Player (P) is at position (5,1)
2. Goal (G) is at position (2,0)
3. There's a clear path along the left side and top of the maze

To reach the goal, I need to move up along the left side of the maze.

For my next move, I'll move up from position (5,1) to (4,1).

My next move coordinates are: (4,0)

This will move me one step up along the left wall, which is the correct path toward the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
G 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 0 1
P 1 1 1 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving up along the left side of the maze towards the goal.

From my current position at (4,0), I'll move up to (3,0).

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

This continues the path upward along the left wall, getting closer to the goal at (2,0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form an "L" shape (or inverted "L" shape, depending on orientation). The path consists of a vertical corridor along the left side and a horizontal corridor along the bottom.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an "L" shape but with a different arrangement:

1 0 0 0 0 0 G
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is formed by a vertical corridor on the right side and a horizontal corridor at the bottom
- The player (P) starts at the bottom of the vertical corridor
- The goal (G) is at the top of the vertical corridor
- The maze maintains the same dimensions and encoding scheme as the original
- The path shape is still recognizably an "L", but it's positioned differently than in the original maze
