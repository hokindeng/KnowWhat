You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 G 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,2)
3. We need to navigate through the empty spaces (0s) to reach G
4. Looking at the available paths, we need to move down and then right to reach the goal

For my next move, I choose to move down to coordinate (5,0).

This is a valid move because:
1. It's adjacent to the current position
2. It's an empty space (0)
3. It moves us closer to the goal

Please move to coordinate (5,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1 1 1
P 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 G 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (5,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,2)
3. We need to move down and then right to reach the goal

For my next move, I choose to move down to coordinate (6,0).

This is a valid move because:
1. It's adjacent to the current position
2. It's an empty space (0)
3. It continues our path toward the goal

Please move to coordinate (6,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
P 0 G 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (6,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,2)
3. We can move right to reach the goal

For my next move, I choose to move right to coordinate (6,1).

This is a valid move because:
1. It's adjacent to the current position
2. It's an empty space (0)
3. It moves us closer to the goal, with just one more move needed after this

Please move to coordinate (6,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 P G 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the final move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (6,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,2)
3. We can reach the goal with one final move to the right

For my next move, I choose to move right to coordinate (6,2).

This is a valid move because:
1. It's adjacent to the current position
2. It's the goal position (G)
3. This will complete the maze

Please move to coordinate (6,2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

(1) The empty spaces form an "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation).

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an "L" shape but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms an "L" shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
