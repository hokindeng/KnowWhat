You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 G 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,2)
3. There are empty spaces (0) available to move through
4. We need to find a path from P to G while avoiding walls (1)

Looking at the available moves from the current position (4,0):
- Up: blocked by wall
- Down: empty space at (5,0)
- Left: not possible (edge of maze)
- Right: empty space at (4,1)

Since we need to eventually reach the goal at (6,2), and there's a clear path going down and then right towards the goal, I'll choose to move down.

My next move: (5,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1 1 1
P 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 G 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (5,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,2)
3. Looking at available moves from (5,0):
   - Up: empty space at (4,0)
   - Down: empty space at (6,0)
   - Left: not possible (edge of maze)
   - Right: blocked by wall

Since we need to reach the goal at (6,2), and there's a path through the bottom row that leads to G, I'll choose to move down.

My next move: (6,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
P 0 G 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (6,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,2)
3. Looking at available moves from (6,0):
   - Up: empty space at (5,0)
   - Down: not possible (edge of maze)
   - Left: not possible (edge of maze)
   - Right: empty space at (6,1)

Since we need to reach the goal at (6,2), and it's just two spaces to the right of us, I'll move right towards the goal.

My next move: (6,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
0 P G 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (6,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,2)
3. Looking at available moves from (6,1):
   - Up: blocked by wall
   - Down: not possible (edge of maze)
   - Left: empty space at (6,0)
   - Right: goal space at (6,2)

We're right next to the goal! I'll move right to reach it.

My next move: (6,2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form an "L" shape, with one corridor going vertically and another horizontally, meeting at a right angle.

Here's my new maze design with the same "L" shape pattern but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1

This maze:
1. Has the same 7x7 dimensions as the original
2. Contains an "L" shaped corridor
3. Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
4. Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape
5. Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for corridors, P for player, G for goal)

The L-shape is formed by a vertical corridor that connects to a horizontal corridor at a right angle, just like in the original maze, but I've positioned it differently within the grid.
