You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 G 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. The maze is 7x7
2. Current position 'P' is at (1,2)
3. Goal 'G' is at (4,2)
4. There's a clear path from P to G through the empty spaces (0s)

Looking at the maze, I can see that the shortest path to the goal is to move right through the empty spaces.

For my next move, I want to move one step right from position (1,2) to (2,2).

I choose coordinates: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 G 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I can see that I'm now at position (2,2) and need to continue moving toward the goal at (4,2).

There's an empty space to my right, and this continues to be the most direct path to the goal.

I choose to move right to coordinates: (3,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

1. The empty spaces (corridors) form a "U" shape, with:
- A horizontal path at the top (connecting P and G)
- Two vertical paths down the sides
- A horizontal path at the bottom connecting the vertical paths

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a U-shaped corridor pattern but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same U-shaped corridor pattern
- Places P and G at different positions but still connected by the U-shaped path
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for corridors, P for player, G for goal)
- Maintains the same overall size
- Creates a valid, solvable path from P to G
