You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 G 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The maze is 7x7
- Current position 'P' is at (1,2)
- Goal position 'G' is at (4,2)
- There's a clear path from P to G through the empty spaces

For my next move, I want to move right from the current position (1,2) to coordinate (2,2), as this moves me closer to the goal.

I choose coordinates: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 G 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I can see that I'm now at position (2,2) and need to continue moving towards the goal at (4,2).

Looking at the maze, I can move right to coordinate (3,2) to continue on the path toward the goal.

I choose coordinates: (3,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "U" shape, with the vertical parts of the U on both sides and the horizontal part at the bottom connecting them.

2) Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming a U shape, but with a different arrangement than the original:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms a U shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the U shape pattern
- Is surrounded by walls (1s) on the border
- Has a valid solution (player can reach the goal)
