You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

Current observations:
- The player (P) is at position (2,3)
- The goal (G) is at position (5,5)
- There is a clear path around the central block of walls

For the next move, I want to move right towards the goal.
The coordinates for my next move are: (2,4)

This move will:
1. Keep me in the empty space
2. Move me closer to the goal
3. Allow me to continue down the right side of the maze to reach the goal

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:
- I am now at position (2,4)
- The goal (G) is at position (5,5)
- I need to move towards the right side of the maze and then down to reach the goal

For the next move, I want to move right to reach the rightmost empty path.
The coordinates for my next move are: (2,5)

This will position me in the rightmost empty corridor, from where I can then move downward towards the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:
- I am now at position (2,5)
- The goal (G) is at position (5,5)
- I need to move down along the right side of the maze to reach the goal

For the next move, I want to move down one step.
The coordinates for my next move are: (3,5)

This continues my path downward along the right side of the maze, bringing me closer to the goal position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:
- I am now at position (3,5)
- The goal (G) is at position (5,5)
- I need to continue moving down along the right side of the maze

For the next move, I want to move down one more step.
The coordinates for my next move are: (4,5)

This continues my path downward along the right side of the maze, bringing me just one step away from the goal position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:
- I am now at position (4,5)
- The goal (G) is at position (5,5)
- I am just one step away from the goal

For the next move, I want to move down one final step to reach the goal.
The coordinates for my next move are: (5,5)

This move will complete the path and reach the goal position (G).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "U" shape. The path goes from the top, down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "U" shaped corridor but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The U-shape is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise compared to the original
- The path still forms a clear U-shape
- The player (P) starts at the top left of the U
- The goal (G) is at the end of the U
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The layout is different from the original while maintaining the U-shape concept
