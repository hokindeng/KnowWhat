You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. The player 'P' is at position (2,3)
2. The goal 'G' is at position (5,5)
3. There are empty spaces '0' around the player position

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach the goal, I need to move right first and then navigate around the walls to reach 'G'.

For my next move, I'll move right from position (2,3) to position (2,4).

My next move coordinates are: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I'm now at position (2,4)
2. The goal 'G' is still at position (5,5)
3. I can see that I need to go around the walls to reach the goal

The best path would be to move right and then go down around the walls through the empty spaces.

For my next move, I'll move right from position (2,4) to position (2,5).

My next move coordinates are: (2,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I'm now at position (2,5)
2. The goal 'G' is at position (5,5)
3. I need to move down through the empty spaces to reach the goal

From my current position, I can move down to the empty space below me, which will allow me to continue navigating around the walls to reach the goal.

For my next move, I'll move down from position (2,5) to position (3,5).

My next move coordinates are: (3,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I'm now at position (3,5)
2. The goal 'G' is at position (5,5)
3. I need to continue moving down to reach the goal

From my current position, I can move down to the empty space below me, which will put me one step closer to the goal.

For my next move, I'll move down from position (3,5) to position (4,5).

My next move coordinates are: (4,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 P 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I'm now at position (4,5)
2. The goal 'G' is at position (5,5)
3. I'm just one step away from the goal

From my current position, I can move down one last time to reach the goal position.

For my next move, I'll move down from position (4,5) to position (5,5), which is where 'G' is located.

My next move coordinates are: (5,5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a "U" shape, with the open end at the top and the bottom of the U running along the bottom edge of the maze.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a U-shaped corridor but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions as the original (7x7)
- Maintains a U-shaped corridor
- Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original maze
- The U-shape is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise compared to the original, with the open end on the right and the bottom of the U running along the left edge
