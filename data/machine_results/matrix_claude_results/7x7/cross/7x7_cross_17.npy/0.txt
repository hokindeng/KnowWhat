You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,3)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,5)
3. Looking at possible paths:
   - Direct path to the right is blocked by a wall at (3,4)
   - There's an empty space at (2,4) which could help reach the goal
   - We can move diagonally up-right to (2,4)

I'll move to position (2,4), which is diagonally up and to the right from the current position.

My next move coordinates are: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (2,4), and I can see that:
1. The goal 'G' is at (3,5)
2. I can move diagonally down-right to reach the goal directly since there's no wall blocking this path

Therefore, I'll move diagonally down and right to reach the goal position.

My next move coordinates are: (3,5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

1. The empty spaces (corridors) form a "Z" shape, with:
   - A horizontal line at the top (at row 1)
   - A diagonal line in the middle
   - A horizontal line at the bottom (at row 3)

2. Here's my new maze with a "Z" shaped corridor:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a clear "Z" shaped path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze
- Maintains the same general "Z" shape pattern with the corridors
- Allows valid movement from P to G through empty spaces
