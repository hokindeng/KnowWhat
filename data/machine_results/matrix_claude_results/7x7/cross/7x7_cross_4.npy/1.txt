You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

Current position (P) is at (5,0)
Goal position (G) is at (3,2)

Looking at the maze, I need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. Since diagonal moves are allowed, I can move diagonally up-right to position (4,1), which is an empty space (0).

My next move coordinates are: (4,1)

This move will:
1. Get me closer to the goal
2. Use an allowed diagonal movement
3. Move to an empty space
4. Avoid walls

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current position (P) is at (4,1)
Goal position (G) is at (3,2)

From my current position, I can see that moving diagonally up-right to position (3,2) will take me directly to the goal position (G). This is an allowed move since diagonal movements are permitted.

My next move coordinates are: (3,2)

This move will:
1. Take me directly to the goal
2. Use an allowed diagonal movement
3. Reach the target position G

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

1. The empty spaces (corridors) form a "Z" shape. The path starts at the bottom left, moves diagonally up to the middle, and then continues diagonally up to the top right.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern with its empty spaces, but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 G 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Maintains the same 7x7 dimensions
- Has a clear "Z" pattern in its empty spaces
- Provides a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze but preserves the same general shape concept
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
