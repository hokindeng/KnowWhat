You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 P 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (0,4)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (2,4)
3. I need to move from P to G
4. Looking at the available paths, I can see that I can move directly down since there's a clear vertical path

For my next move, I choose to move one step down to coordinates (1,4).

This will get me closer to the goal position while staying on a valid path.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 P 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (including P and G positions) is a "Y" shape, with the vertical line of the Y at column 4 and the two arms branching out to the right.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with a Y-shaped corridor:

1 1 1 1 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, I've maintained the Y shape but modified the right branch pattern while keeping it recognizable as a Y. The vertical line remains the same, but the arms of the Y are now more uniform in their extension to the right.

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
