You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 G 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The player (P) is at position (2,1)
- The goal (G) is at position (0,1)
- I can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally

Looking at the available paths:
- Moving directly up to (1,1) is blocked by a wall
- Moving up-right to (1,2) is possible through the empty space ('0')
- Moving right to (2,2) is blocked by a wall
- Other directions are either blocked by walls or would move away from the goal

The most efficient path to reach the goal would be to first move up-right to position (1,2), which is an empty space that gets me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 G 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:
- I am now at position (1,2)
- The goal (G) is at position (0,1)
- I need to find a way to move towards the goal

Looking at the available moves:
- Moving up-left to (0,1) would take me directly to the goal (G)
- Moving up to (0,2) is blocked by a wall
- Moving right to (1,3) is blocked by a wall
- Other directions are either blocked or would take me away from the goal

Since I can move diagonally and there's a clear path to the goal, I'll move up-left to reach the goal position.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze (0s and the positions of P and G), they form a "Z" shape. The path starts at the bottom, moves up diagonally to the middle, and then moves up diagonally again to reach the top.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern with its empty spaces, but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces still form a "Z" shape
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The maze has different positions for P, G, and the empty spaces compared to the original
- The overall "Z" shape is still recognizable in the pattern of empty spaces
