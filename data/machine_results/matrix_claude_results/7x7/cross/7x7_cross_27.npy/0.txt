You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (1,3)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (1,1)
3. We need to move from P to G
4. Looking at possible moves:
   - Moving diagonally up-left would get us closer to G
   - The space at (0,2) is a wall
   - The space at (2,2) is empty

Since we can move diagonally and the goal is to the left and slightly up from our current position, I'll suggest moving to (2,2) as our first move. This will help us create a path towards G.

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,2)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (1,1)
3. We need to continue moving towards G
4. Looking at possible moves:
   - Moving up-left would get us closer to G
   - The space at (1,2) is empty
   - This would position us one step away from G

I'll suggest moving to (1,2), which will put us in a position to reach G in the next move.

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze:

1. The general shape formed by the corridors appears to be a "Z" shape (or reversed "S"). The path starts at the top, moves diagonally down through the middle, and then continues at the bottom.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern with its corridors, but with a different arrangement of walls:

0 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Maintains the same dimensions (7x7)
- Has a clear "Z" shaped corridor
- Provides a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original maze
- The empty spaces form a recognizable "Z" pattern

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
