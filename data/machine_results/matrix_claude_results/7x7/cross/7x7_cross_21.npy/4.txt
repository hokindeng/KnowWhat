You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The player (P) is at position (3,0)
- The goal (G) is at position (3,2)
- There's an empty space at (1,0) and (1,2)
- There's also an empty space at (2,1)

Looking at the possible paths, I can see that to reach the goal (G), I need to:
1. Move up to (2,1) through the empty spaces

Therefore, for my next move, I choose to move to coordinates (2,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
- I'm now at position (2,1)
- The goal (G) is at position (3,2)
- There's an empty space at (1,0) and (1,2)

To reach the goal (G), I should:
1. Move to the empty space at (1,2)

Therefore, for my next move, I choose to move to coordinates (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
- I'm now at position (1,2)
- The goal (G) is at position (3,2)
- I can move directly down to the goal since they share the same column

Therefore, for my next move, I choose to move to coordinates (3,2), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), with the path starting at the bottom left, moving up, then across, and then down to the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The Z-shape is still present but shifted slightly right
- The path still requires moving up, across, and down to reach the goal
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
- The pattern is recognizable as a Z but is not identical to the original maze
