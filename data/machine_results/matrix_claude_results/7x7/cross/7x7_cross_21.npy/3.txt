You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The player (P) is at position (3,0)
- The goal (G) is at position (3,2)
- There's an empty space at (1,0) and (1,2)
- There's also an empty space at (2,1)

Looking at the possible paths, I can see that to reach the goal (G), I need to:
1. Move up to (2,1) diagonally
2. Then move right to reach G

For my first move, I'll move diagonally up-right to position (2,1).

My next move coordinates are: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (2,1), and I can see the goal (G) is just one step to the right at (3,2).

I'll move diagonally down-right to reach the goal position.

My next move coordinates are: (3,2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze (0, P, G positions), they form a rough "Z" shape, moving from top to bottom:
- Starting at (1,0)
- Going right to (1,2)
- Diagonally down-left through (2,1)
- Ending at (3,0) and (3,2)

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern with its corridors but is not identical to the original:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 G 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The "Z" shape is slightly larger but maintains the same basic form
- It still provides a valid path from P to G
- The empty spaces create a clear "Z" pattern
- The maze uses the same encoding system as the original
