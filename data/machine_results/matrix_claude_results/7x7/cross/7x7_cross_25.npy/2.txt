You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. Player (P) is at position (2,3)
2. Goal (G) is at position (0,5)
3. Looking at possible paths, I need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls
4. There's an empty space (0) at (1,4) that can help create a path to the goal

The most efficient path would be to move diagonally up-right to position (1,4), as this is an empty space that will get me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (1,4), and I can see:
1. The goal (G) is at (0,5)
2. There's an empty space (0) at (0,3) that can help me reach the goal

From my current position (1,4), I should move to the empty space at (0,3) which will put me in position to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 P 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,3), and I can see:
1. The goal (G) is at (0,5), just two spaces to my right
2. There's an empty space (0) at (1,4) that I can use to get around the wall at (0,4)

Since I can't move directly right to the goal due to the wall at (0,4), I need to go back down to (1,4) first, which will then allow me to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 0 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm back at position (1,4), and I can see:
1. The goal (G) is at (0,5)
2. From my current position, I can move diagonally up-right to reach the goal

Since I'm now positioned at (1,4), I can make the final move diagonally up-right to reach the goal at (0,5).

I choose to move to coordinates: (0,5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces (0s) and the path from P to G form a rough "Z" shape, where you need to move up-right, then up-left, then up-right again to reach the goal.

Here's my new maze with a similar "Z" shape pattern, but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 1 1 0 G 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
1. The "Z" shape is still present but shifted slightly left
2. The path follows the same zigzag pattern: up-right, up-left, up-right
3. The maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions
4. The path from P to G is valid through empty spaces
5. The layout is different from the original while maintaining the same general shape concept
