You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. Player position (P) is at (4,4)
2. Goal position (G) is at (0,5)
3. We need to move upward and slightly to the right to reach the goal

Looking at the available moves from position (4,4):
- Up: (3,4) is blocked by a wall (1)
- Up-right: (3,5) is blocked by a wall (1)
- Right: (4,5) is an empty space (0)
- Down-right: (5,5) is blocked by a wall (1)
- Down: (5,4) is blocked by a wall (1)
- Down-left: (5,3) is blocked by a wall (1)
- Left: (4,3) is blocked by a wall (1)
- Up-left: (3,3) is an empty space (0)

The best move appears to be right to position (4,5), as this will get us closer to the goal while keeping our options open for subsequent moves.

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current observations:
1. Player position (P) is at (4,5)
2. Goal position (G) is at (0,5)
3. We need to continue moving upward to reach the goal

Looking at the available moves from position (4,5):
- Up: (3,5) is an empty space (0)
- Up-right: (3,6) is blocked by a wall (1)
- Right: (4,6) is blocked by a wall (1)
- Down-right: (5,6) is blocked by a wall (1)
- Down: (5,5) is blocked by a wall (1)
- Down-left: (5,4) is blocked by a wall (1)
- Left: (4,4) is blocked by a wall (1)
- Up-left: (3,4) is an empty space (0)

The best move is up to position (3,5), as this brings us closer to the goal and provides access to the upper portion of the maze.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,5)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 0 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

(1) The empty spaces form a general "S" shape, starting from the bottom and winding up to the goal.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size with a similar "S" shape pattern, but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 0 1 1 G 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Maintains the 7x7 dimensions
- Has a valid S-shaped path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze
- Preserves the general S-shape pattern of corridors
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for paths, P for player, G for goal)
