You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (5,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. There are empty spaces (0) that can form a path

Looking at the available moves from the current position (5,2), I can see that moving upward to position (4,3) would be the best next move, as it gets us closer to the goal while following a valid path through empty spaces.

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,3)
2. The goal (G) is still at position (3,4)
3. I can see an empty space (0) at (3,2) that will help me get closer to the goal

From my current position (4,3), I should move up and slightly left to the empty space at (3,2), which will then allow me to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. The player (P) is now at position (3,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I can reach the goal by moving right through the empty space at (3,3)

From my current position (3,2), I should move right to position (3,4) to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze, they form a "Z" shape. The path starts at the bottom, goes up diagonally to the middle, and then continues diagonally up to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a "Z" shape with its corridors, but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces still form a "Z" shape
- The path is valid and reachable
- The shape is recognizable but positioned differently from the original
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
