You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The player (P) is at position (1,4)
- The goal (G) is at position (1,6)
- There is a path through empty spaces (0) that connects them

Looking at the available moves from the current position (1,4), I can see that moving right and slightly down through the empty space at (2,5) would be the best path towards the goal.

For my next move, I choose to move to coordinates: (2,5)

This will move me one step closer to the goal while staying on valid empty spaces.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,5), I can see that I can move directly up to reach the goal (G) at (1,6).

For my next move, I choose to move to coordinates: (1,6)

This will take me directly to the goal position and complete the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), with a vertical line connecting the top and bottom segments.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern of empty spaces while being different from the original:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces still form a "Z" shape
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The maze has the same 7x7 dimensions
- The pattern is recognizably different from the original while maintaining the same general shape
- The path follows the characteristic three segments of a "Z": horizontal top, diagonal middle, and horizontal bottom
