You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,4)
2. The goal (G) is at position (0,6)
3. We need to find a path from P to G moving through empty spaces (0)

Looking at the possible moves from the current position (2,4):
- Up: blocked by wall
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: there's an empty space at (1,4)
- Right: blocked by wall
- Diagonals: all blocked by walls

The best move appears to be to the left, to position (1,4), as this will help us get closer to the goal while using an available empty space.

I choose to move to coordinates: (1,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern) from the goal at the bottom left, moving up and right, then down and right.

Here's my new maze with the same Z-shaped pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 0 1 1

This new maze:
1. Maintains the same 7x7 dimensions
2. Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
3. Is different from the original maze (changed some wall positions while maintaining the Z pattern)
4. Preserves the Z-shaped corridor pattern from bottom left to top right and back down

The key difference from the original maze is mainly in the top rows, where I adjusted some wall positions while ensuring the Z-shape connectivity remains intact.
