You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. Player (P) is at position (6,6)
2. Goal (G) is at position (4,6)
3. There is a path of empty spaces (0s) that connects P to G

Looking at the maze, I need to move upward and slightly left to reach the goal. The best next move would be to move diagonally up-left to the empty space at position (5,5).

I choose coordinates: (5,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
1. Player (P) is now at position (5,5)
2. Goal (G) is at position (4,6)
3. There is an empty space (0) at position (4,4) that will help me reach the goal

From my current position, I need to move up and then right to reach the goal. The best next move would be to move diagonally up-left to the empty space at position (4,4).

I choose coordinates: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
1. Player (P) is now at position (4,4)
2. Goal (G) is at position (4,6)
3. I can reach the goal by moving right through the empty space at (4,5)

From my current position, I need to move right to reach the goal. The best next move would be to move right to position (4,6), which is the goal position.

I choose coordinates: (4,6)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), with one segment going diagonally from bottom right to middle, and another segment going from middle to top right.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern with its empty spaces, but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 G
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 P

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions as the original
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms a "Z" shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general pattern
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
