You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (1,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (5,1)
3. We need to navigate from P to G while avoiding walls (1's)
4. We can move in any direction, including diagonals

Looking at the maze, I can see that we need to move downward to eventually reach G. The most direct path appears to be going down.

I recommend moving to coordinates (2,2), which is an empty space (0) diagonally down and to the right from the current position.

My next move: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,2)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (5,1)
3. We need to continue moving downward and leftward to reach G

Looking at the available paths, I can see that we can move to the empty space (0) at (3,3), which will help us progress toward the goal.

I recommend moving to coordinates (3,3).

My next move: (3,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (3,3)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (5,1)
3. We need to continue moving down and left to reach G

Looking at the available paths, I can see that we can move to the empty space (0) at (4,2), which will help us get closer to the goal.

I recommend moving to coordinates (4,2).

My next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,2)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (5,1)
3. We're very close to the goal now

From our current position, we can move directly to the goal position since it's adjacent to our current position (diagonally down and to the left).

I recommend moving to coordinates (5,1), which is the goal position.

My next move: (5,1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces (0's) in the original maze, they form a rough "X" or "cross" shape, with corridors extending from corner to corner of the maze.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "X" shape pattern with its empty spaces, but with a slightly different arrangement:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 G 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

This new maze:
- Maintains the same 7x7 dimensions
- Has empty spaces forming an "X" shape
- Provides a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original maze but preserves the general "X" pattern
- Has empty spaces at the corners like the original
- Places P and G in positions that can be connected through the empty spaces
