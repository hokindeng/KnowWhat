You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (1,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (5,1)
3. We need to navigate from P to G while avoiding walls (1's)
4. We can move in any direction, including diagonally

Looking at the maze, I can see that we need to move downward to eventually reach G. The best next move would be to move diagonally down-right to position (2,2), which is an empty space (0).

I choose to move to coordinates: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,2)
2. The goal (G) is still at position (5,1)
3. We need to continue moving downward and leftward to reach G

Looking at the available paths, I can see that we can move to the empty space (0) at position (3,3). This will help us progress towards the goal by moving diagonally down-right.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (3,3)
2. The goal (G) is still at position (5,1)
3. We need to continue moving down and left to reach G

Looking at the available paths, I can see that we can move to the empty space (0) at position (4,2). This diagonal move down-left will help us get closer to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (5,1)
3. We're very close to the goal now

From our current position, we can move directly to the goal with one diagonal move down-left.

I choose to move to coordinates: (5,1) where G is located.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces (0's) in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape, with the path zigzagging from top to bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shaped corridor but with a slightly different arrangement:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 0

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions (7x7)
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms a "Z" shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general pattern
- Preserves the outer frame structure of the original
- Has P and G in the same positions as the original

The "Z" shape is still visible, moving from top-right, diagonally through the center, and then to the bottom-left where G is located.
