You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,4)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (2,2)
3. We need to move from P to G
4. Looking at the available paths, I can see that we can move diagonally to the left and up through the empty space at (1,3)

Since we can move diagonally and there's an empty space at (1,3), I'll move to that position.

My next move coordinates are: (1,3)

This will get us closer to the goal while staying on valid empty spaces.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (1,3)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (2,2)
3. We can move diagonally down and left to reach the goal directly

Since we can move diagonally and the goal position is immediately accessible from our current position, I'll move directly to the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

This will complete the path to the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1) The empty spaces form a "Z" shape (when considering the path from P to G).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a Z shape:

1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 1 1 1
1 1 G 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is not identical to the original
- Forms a clear Z shape with its corridors
- Maintains the same encoding system (1=wall, 0=empty space, P=player, G=goal)
