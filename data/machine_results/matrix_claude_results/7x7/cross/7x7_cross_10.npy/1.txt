You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (5,5)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,3)
3. We need to navigate through empty spaces (0) to reach the goal

Looking at the available paths:
- There's an empty space (0) at (5,3)
- There's an empty space (0) at (4,4)
- There's an empty space (0) at (3,5)

To get closer to the goal, the best move would be to move to position (4,4), as this brings us closer to the goal while using available empty spaces.

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,4)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,3)
3. We need to continue moving through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the available paths:
- There's an empty space (0) at (5,3)
- There's an empty space (0) at (3,5)
- Most importantly, we can move diagonally to (3,3) where the goal (G) is

Since we can reach the goal directly from our current position with a diagonal move to the upper-left, this is clearly the best move.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces (0) and the path from P to G form a rough "Z" shape.

(1) The general shape formed by the corridors is a "Z"

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a Z shape, but with a different arrangement than the original:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces clearly form a Z pattern
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The shape is similar to the original but positioned differently in the grid
- The maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions as the original
