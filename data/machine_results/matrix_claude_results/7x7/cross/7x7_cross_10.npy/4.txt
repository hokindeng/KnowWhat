You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (5,5)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,3)
3. We need to navigate through empty spaces (0) to reach the goal

Looking at the available moves from the current position (5,5):
- There's an empty space (0) at (5,3)
- There's an empty space (0) at (4,4)

To get closer to the goal, the best move would be to move to position (4,4), as this brings us diagonally closer to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,4)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,3)
3. From the current position, I can see:
   - There's an empty space (0) at (3,3) - which is the goal
   - There's an empty space (0) at (5,3)

Since I can move diagonally and the goal (G) is directly accessible from my current position, I'll move diagonally to the goal position.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), with empty spaces connecting from the bottom right, through the middle, to the top left where the goal is.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions (7x7)
- Forms a "Z" shape with its empty spaces
- Provides a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze
- Maintains the recognizable "Z" pattern in its corridors

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
