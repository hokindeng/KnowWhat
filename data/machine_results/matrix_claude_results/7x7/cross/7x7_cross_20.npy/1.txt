You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal 'G'.

Current position 'P' is at (4,4)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,6)

Looking at the maze, I can see that there's a path from P to G through the empty spaces ('0').
The optimal path would be to move diagonally up-right to the empty space at (3,5), then up-right again to (2,5), and finally right to reach G at (2,6).

For my first move, I choose to move diagonally up-right to coordinates (3,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,5), I can see that I need to move up-right to reach the goal.

I choose to move diagonally up-right to coordinates (2,6), which is the goal position 'G'.

This move will complete the path to the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), starting from P, going up-right diagonally through the empty spaces, and reaching G.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but positioned differently while maintaining the same basic concept:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The "Z" shape is more traditional (less diagonal)
- It still provides a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- The shape is clearly recognizable as a "Z"
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
- The path follows the same principle of connecting P to G through a zigzag pattern
