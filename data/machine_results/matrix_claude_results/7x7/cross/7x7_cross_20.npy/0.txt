You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal 'G'.

Current position 'P' is at (4,4)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,6)

Looking at the maze, I can see that there's a path from P to G through the empty spaces ('0').
The optimal path would be to move diagonally up-right to the empty space at (3,5), then up-right again to (2,5), and finally right to reach G.

For my first move, I choose to move to coordinates (3,5), which is diagonally up and to the right from the current position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,5), I can see that I need to move up to reach the empty space that leads to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (2,5), which is directly up from my current position. This will put me in position to make the final move to reach the goal 'G'.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), starting from P, going up-right diagonally, and then right to G.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The "Z" shape is still present but shifted slightly to the left
- The path still requires diagonal and horizontal movements
- The start (P) and goal (G) positions are still connected through empty spaces
- The overall shape of the path maintains the characteristic angles of a "Z"
