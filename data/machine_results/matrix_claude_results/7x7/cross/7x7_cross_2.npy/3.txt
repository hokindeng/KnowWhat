You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,3) - counting from 0, where first number is column, second is row
2. The goal (G) is at position (0,5)
3. I need to find a path from P to G through the empty spaces (0s)

Looking at the available paths:
- There's an empty space at (1,4) that can be reached diagonally
- This will help create a path towards the goal

I recommend moving to coordinates (1,4) - this is a diagonal move down-left from the current position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form:

(1) A zigzag or "Z" shape pattern, where the empty spaces create a diagonal line that connects the top and bottom through a series of alternating turns.

(2) Here's a new maze with the same Z-shaped pattern but slightly modified:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze maintains the Z-shaped pattern of empty spaces but shifts the pattern slightly while still providing a valid path from P to G through connected empty spaces. The path still requires diagonal movements to navigate from P to G, following the characteristic zigzag pattern of the original maze.
