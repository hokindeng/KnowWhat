You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,3)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (4,1)
3. I need to find a path from P to G through empty spaces (0)

Looking at the available moves:
- There's an empty space at (3,2) which can be reached diagonally from P
- This empty space can then connect to another empty space at (2,2)
- From there, we can reach G at (4,1)

For my next move, I'll move diagonally up-left to position (3,2).

My next move coordinates are: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. I am now at position (3,2)
2. The goal 'G' is at (4,1)
3. I can see an empty space at (2,1) that will help me get closer to G

The best path from here is to move diagonally up-left to the empty space at (2,1).

My next move coordinates are: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. I am now at position (2,1)
2. The goal 'G' is at (4,1)
3. I can move directly down to reach G

From my current position, I can move straight down two spaces to reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (4,1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), with one segment going horizontally at the top, a diagonal segment in the middle, and another horizontal segment at the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern with its empty spaces, but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The top horizontal segment is formed by the empty spaces at row 1
- The diagonal segment goes from top-right to bottom-left
- The bottom horizontal segment connects to the goal
- The path from P to G follows the Z shape
- The overall structure maintains the same zigzag/Z pattern as the original, but with a slightly different implementation
