You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,1)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,3)
3. Looking at possible moves from current position:
   - Up: blocked by wall
   - Down: empty space at (4,2)
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: blocked by wall
   - Diagonals: blocked by walls

The best path to reach 'G' appears to be:
1. Move to (4,2) first, which is the empty space below and slightly to the right
2. This will allow us to eventually reach the goal through the available empty spaces

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,2)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,3)
3. Looking at possible moves from current position:
   - Up: empty space at (3,1)
   - Down: blocked by wall
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: blocked by wall
   - Diagonals: blocked by walls

To reach the goal, I need to move up first and then find a path to the right. The empty space at (3,1) is the only valid move available.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,1)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,3)
3. Looking at possible moves from current position:
   - Up: blocked by wall
   - Down: empty space at (4,2)
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: blocked by wall
   - Diagonals: blocked by walls

I notice we've returned to a previous position. Looking at the maze structure, to reach the goal 'G', we need to:
1. Move down to (4,2)
2. Then find a path that leads to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4,2).

This creates a cycle, but let me try this path again as there might be a solution I'm missing from this position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize, but I now realize we're entering a loop. Let me carefully analyze the situation:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,2)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,3)
3. Looking at all possible moves and the overall maze structure:
   - We can move up to (3,1), but we've already tried that path
   - We can't move directly to the goal due to the wall at (4,3)
   - Looking at the entire maze structure, there doesn't appear to be any path that would allow us to reach the goal position (3,3)

After this analysis, I must conclude that this maze is unsolvable. There is no valid path from the starting position to the goal position as they are separated by walls with no traversable path between them.

Should I still make a move, or would you like to confirm that this maze is indeed unsolvable?

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces (0s) in the original maze, they form a "U" shape, but the shape is broken/disconnected by a wall, which is why the maze is unsolvable.

Here's my answer:

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "U" shape.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size with a connected "U" shape that allows reaching G from P:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form a clear, connected "U" shape
- P can reach G by following the "U" path
- The maze maintains the same dimensions (7x7)
- The shape is similar to the original but is now properly connected
- The path is recognizable as a "U" shape when looking at the empty spaces
