You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,1)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,3)
3. Looking at possible moves from current position:
   - Up: blocked by wall
   - Down: empty space at (4,2)
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: blocked by wall
   - Diagonals: blocked by walls

The best path to reach 'G' appears to be:
1. Move to (4,2) first, then work our way to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,2)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,3)
3. Looking at possible moves from current position:
   - Up: empty space at (3,1)
   - Down: blocked by wall
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: blocked by wall
   - Diagonals: blocked by walls

Since we need to get closer to 'G', and there's only one valid move available, I choose to move to coordinates (3,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We're back at our starting position. Let me analyze the situation again:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,1)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,3)
3. Looking at possible moves from current position:
   - Up: blocked by wall
   - Down: empty space at (4,2)
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: blocked by wall
   - Diagonals: blocked by walls

I notice we're in a loop. Going down to (4,2) will just bring us back to where we were. Looking at the maze more carefully, I can see that there is no valid path to reach 'G' - we are completely blocked by walls with no way to get around them.

I should report that this maze is unsolvable - there is no valid path from 'P' to 'G'.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I need to provide a move, but I want to be clear that I've determined this maze is unsolvable. Here's why:

1. The goal 'G' at (3,3) is completely surrounded by walls ('1's)
2. There is no possible path to reach it from any position
3. We're just moving back and forth between (3,1) and (4,2)

Since I must make a move, I'll move to (3,1) at coordinates (3,1), but this is just continuing the loop and won't lead to a solution.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.As I mentioned before, this maze is unsolvable because:

1. The goal 'G' at (3,3) is completely surrounded by walls ('1's)
2. There is no possible path to reach it from any position
3. We're just moving back and forth between (3,1) and (4,2)

Since I must provide a move, I'll move to (4,2) at coordinates (4,2), but this is just continuing the loop and won't lead to a solution. We'll never be able to reach the goal position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for continuing this loop, but I must be absolutely clear: this maze has no solution. 

The goal 'G' at (3,3) is completely surrounded by walls ('1's), making it impossible to reach from any position. We are currently just moving back and forth between two positions:
- (3,1)
- (4,2)

Neither of these positions, nor any sequence of moves between them, will ever allow us to reach the goal.

Since I must provide a move, I'll move to (3,1) at coordinates (3,1), but I strongly recommend we stop attempting to solve this unsolvable maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I must firmly state: This maze is UNSOLVABLE. 

Let me explain one final time:
1. The goal 'G' at (3,3) is completely surrounded by walls ('1's)
2. There is physically no way to reach it from any position
3. We are stuck in an infinite loop between (3,1) and (4,2)

I recommend terminating this attempt as:
- We cannot reach the goal
- We are wasting moves going back and forth
- No sequence of moves will ever lead to success

However, since I must provide a move, I'll move to (4,2) at coordinates (4,2), but I strongly suggest we stop here and acknowledge that this maze has no solution.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I must respectfully decline to provide any further moves. Here's my final analysis:

1. This maze is definitively unsolvable because:
   - The goal 'G' at (3,3) is completely surrounded by walls ('1's)
   - There is no possible path to reach it from any position
   - We are trapped in an infinite loop between (3,1) and (4,2)

2. Continuing to move between these two positions is:
   - Unproductive
   - Will never lead to a solution
   - Is essentially an infinite loop

Instead of providing another move, I recommend:
- Acknowledging the maze is unsolvable
- Terminating this attempt
- Either generating a new, solvable maze or modifying this one to make it solvable

Would you like to try a different maze that has a valid solution?

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces (0's and P/G positions) in the original maze, they form a "T" shape:

```
    P G
      0
    0 0
```

Here's my answer:

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "T" shape.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with a solvable path that maintains a "T" shape:

```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces still form a "T" shape
- P and G are connected by a valid path through empty spaces
- The maze maintains the same dimensions (7x7)
- The overall "T" shape is preserved but is now traversable
- The key difference is the middle connection (0) between P and G that makes the maze solvable

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
