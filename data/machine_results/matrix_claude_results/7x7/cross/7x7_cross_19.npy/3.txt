You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,1)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,3)
3. Looking at possible moves from current position:
   - Up: blocked by wall
   - Down: empty space at (4,2)
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: blocked by wall
   - Diagonals: blocked by walls

The best path to reach 'G' appears to be:
1. Move to (4,2) first, which is the only available move
2. This will allow us to navigate around the wall between P and G

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,2)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,3)
3. Looking at possible moves from current position:
   - Up: empty space at (3,1)
   - Down: blocked by wall
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: blocked by wall
   - Diagonals: blocked by walls

The best path to reach 'G' appears to be:
1. Move back up to (3,1)
2. This will allow us to try a different route to reach G

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I notice we've returned to our original position and need to reconsider our strategy. Let me analyze the maze again:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,1)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,3)
3. Looking at possible moves from current position:
   - Up: blocked by wall
   - Down: empty space at (4,2)
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: blocked by wall
   - Diagonals: blocked by walls

I realize that going down to (4,2) led us to a dead end before. Looking at the maze more carefully, I can see that there might be a path through the bottom of the maze:

1. Move down to (5,1) where there's an empty space
2. This might allow us to find a path around the bottom

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (5,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, I can see that:

1. The shape formed by the empty spaces (0s, P, and G) appears to be a "U" shape, with one vertical segment on the left side and another on the right, connected by a horizontal segment at the bottom.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a U-shaped corridor but is not identical to the original:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions (7x7)
- Contains a valid U-shaped path from P to G
- Is not identical to the original
- Maintains the U-shape pattern of corridors
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for corridors, P for start, G for goal)
