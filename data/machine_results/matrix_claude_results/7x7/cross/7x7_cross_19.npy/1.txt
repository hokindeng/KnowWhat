You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,1)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,3)
3. Looking at possible moves from current position:
   - Up: blocked by wall
   - Down: empty space at (4,2)
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: blocked by wall
   - Diagonals: blocked by walls

The best path to reach 'G' appears to be:
1. Move to (4,2) first, which is the empty space below and slightly to the right
2. This will allow us to eventually reach the goal through the available empty spaces

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,2)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,3)
3. Looking at possible moves from current position:
   - Up: empty space at (3,1)
   - Down: blocked by wall
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: blocked by wall
   - Diagonals: blocked by walls

Since we need to get closer to 'G', and there's only one available move, I choose to move to (3,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.We seem to have returned to our starting position at (3,1), and we're now in a loop. Looking at the maze structure more carefully:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,1)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,3)
3. Looking at all possible paths:
   - The only empty spaces accessible from our position are (4,2)
   - We've already tried going through (4,2) and it led us back here
   - There appears to be no valid path to reach 'G'

After this analysis, I must conclude that this maze is unsolvable - there is no valid path from the current position 'P' to the goal 'G'. All potential paths are blocked by walls.

Should I still make a move? If required to move, I would move to (4,2), but this would just continue the loop we've discovered.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.You're right - I need to continue providing moves. Looking at the current state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,2)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,3)
3. Available moves:
   - Up: empty space at (3,1)
   - Down: blocked by wall
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: blocked by wall
   - Diagonals: blocked by walls

Even though we've been here before, I must provide a move. I choose to move to coordinates (3,1).

However, I want to note that we are in a loop between (3,1) and (4,2), and there appears to be no valid path to reach the goal position 'G' as all other paths are blocked by walls.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can now see that:

(1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape, but it's an incomplete/broken U because there's a wall blocking the right side, making it impossible to reach the goal.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size with a complete "U" shape that allows reaching the goal:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form a complete "U" shape
- There is a valid path from P to G
- The shape is recognizable as a "U"
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
- The overall structure is similar but not identical to the original maze
