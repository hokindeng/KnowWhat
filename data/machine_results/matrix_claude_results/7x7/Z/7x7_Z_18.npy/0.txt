You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,3)
3. We need to navigate through the empty spaces (0s) to reach G

Looking at the available moves from the current position (2,1):
- We can move right to (2,2)
- We can move diagonally down-right to (3,2)

Since we need to ultimately reach the goal which is in the lower part of the maze, I'll choose to move right to position (2,2) as this keeps our options open and moves us closer to the goal.

My next move: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,2)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. We need to continue moving towards the goal through empty spaces

Looking at the available moves from (2,2):
- We can move right to (2,3)
- We can move left to (2,1)

Since we need to reach the goal which is below and to the right, moving right keeps us on the optimal path.

My next move: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,3)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. We need to continue moving towards the goal through empty spaces

Looking at the available moves from (2,3):
- We can move right to (2,4)
- We can move left to (2,2)

The goal is below us, and we can see there's a path that goes through position (2,4), then down to (3,4), and eventually to the goal.

My next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,4)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. We need to continue moving towards the goal through empty spaces

Looking at the available moves from (2,4):
- We can move right to (2,5)
- We can move left to (2,3)
- We can move down to (3,4)

Since we need to get to the goal which is below us, and there's a clear path through (3,4), the best move is to go down.

My next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (3,4)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. We need to continue moving towards the goal through empty spaces

Looking at the available moves from (3,4):
- We can move up to (2,4)
- We can move left to (3,3) through the diagonal
- We can move down to (4,3) through the diagonal

Since we need to get to the goal which is below and slightly to the left, and there's a path that leads down and left, moving diagonally down-left to (4,3) is the best choice.

My next move: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,3)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. We need to continue moving towards the goal through empty spaces

Looking at the available moves from (4,3):
- We can move up-right to (3,4)
- We can move left to (4,2) through the diagonal
- We can move down to (5,2) through the diagonal

Since we need to get to the goal which is directly below us but we can't move straight down due to a wall, we need to go around. Looking at the available paths, moving diagonally down-left to (5,2) will get us closer to the goal.

My next move: (5,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (5,2)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. We need to continue moving towards the goal through empty spaces

Looking at the available moves from (5,2):
- We can move diagonally down-right to (6,3), which is the goal position!

We can reach the goal directly from here with one diagonal move.

My next move: (6,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze and the path of empty spaces (corridors), I can observe that:

(1) The empty spaces form an "S" shape (or reverse "S" shape, depending on perspective). The path starts from the top, curves to the right, then curves back to the left as it goes down.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "S" shape pattern but with a slightly different implementation:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The "S" shape is still present but positioned slightly differently
- The path still requires similar curved navigation
- The start and end points (P and G) are positioned to follow the S-curve
- The walls (1s) and empty spaces (0s) create the same general shape pattern
- It's a valid maze with a possible solution from P to G
