You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,3)
3. We need to navigate through the empty spaces (0s) to reach G

Looking at the available moves from the current position (2,1):
- We can move right to (2,2)
- We can move diagonally down-right to (3,2)

Since we need to ultimately reach the goal at (6,3), moving right would be the most efficient next move as it brings us closer to the goal while keeping our options open.

I choose to move to position (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,2)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. From our current position, we can move:
   - Right to (2,3)
   - Diagonally down-right to (3,3)

Since we need to reach (6,3), and there's a path leading down through the maze, moving right to position (2,3) would be the best choice as it continues our progress toward the goal.

I choose to move to position (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,3)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. From our current position, we can move:
   - Right to (2,4)
   - Diagonally down-right to (3,4)

Looking at the overall path to the goal, we need to eventually make our way down to row 6. Moving to (2,4) would be the best choice as it will allow us to use the empty spaces to navigate down toward the goal.

I choose to move to position (2,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,4)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. From our current position, we can move:
   - Down to (3,4)

Looking at the path to the goal, we need to make our way down through the maze. There's a clear path going down through position (3,4) that will eventually lead us to the goal.

I choose to move to position (3,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (3,4)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. From our current position, we can move:
   - Left to (3,3)
   - Down to (4,4)

Looking at the path to the goal, we need to get to position (6,3). Moving left to (3,3) would be the better choice as it brings us closer to the goal's column (column 3), and there appears to be a path that continues downward from there.

I choose to move to position (3,3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

(1) The empty spaces form a general "Z" shape, starting from the top with a horizontal line, then a diagonal line down, and ending with another horizontal line at the bottom.

(2) Here's a new maze with a similar "Z" shape but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze maintains:
- The same 7x7 size
- A "Z" shaped corridor
- A valid path from P to G
- A different specific arrangement than the original
- The same basic shape concept with a top horizontal, diagonal middle, and bottom horizontal segments
