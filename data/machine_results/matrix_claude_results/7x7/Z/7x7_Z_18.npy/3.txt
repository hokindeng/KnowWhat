You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,3)
3. We need to navigate through the empty spaces (0s) to reach G

Looking at the available moves from the current position (2,1):
- We can move right to (2,2)
- We can move diagonally down-right to (3,2)

Since we need to ultimately reach the goal which is in the lower part of the maze, I'll choose to move right to position (2,2) as this keeps our options open and moves us closer to the goal.

My next move: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,2)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. We need to continue moving towards the goal through empty spaces

Looking at the available moves from (2,2):
- We can move right to (2,3)
- We can move left to (2,1)

Since we need to reach the goal which is below and to the right, the best move is to continue moving right to position (2,3), which will keep us progressing towards the goal.

My next move: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,3)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. We need to continue moving towards the goal through empty spaces

Looking at the available moves from (2,3):
- We can move right to (2,4)
- We can move left to (2,2)

The goal is below us, and we can see there's a path that goes through position (2,4) and then down through the empty spaces. Moving right to (2,4) is our best option as it will allow us to eventually reach the goal.

My next move: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,4)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. We need to continue moving towards the goal through empty spaces

Looking at the available moves from (2,4):
- We can move right to (2,5)
- We can move left to (2,3)
- We can move down to (3,4)

From our current position, we need to get down to reach the goal. Looking at the path, we can move down to position (3,4), which will allow us to continue our path towards the goal.

My next move: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (3,4)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. We need to continue moving towards the goal through empty spaces

Looking at the available moves from (3,4):
- We can move up to (2,4)
- We can move left to (3,3)

Since we need to reach the goal which is below and to the left of our current position, and there's a path through the empty spaces that leads there, we should move left to position (3,3).

My next move: (3,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

(1) The empty spaces form a general "Z" shape, with a horizontal line at the top, a diagonal line in the middle, and a horizontal line at the bottom.

(2) Here's a new maze with the same "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 1 1

This new maze:
- Maintains the same 7x7 dimensions
- Has a clear "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces
- Provides a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze but preserves the essential "Z" shape pattern
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
