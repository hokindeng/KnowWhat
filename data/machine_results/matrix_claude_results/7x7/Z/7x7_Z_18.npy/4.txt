You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (6,3)
3. We need to navigate through the empty spaces (0s) to reach G

Looking at the available moves from the current position (2,1):
- We can move right to (2,2)
- We can move diagonally down-right to (3,2)

Since we need to ultimately reach the goal at (6,3), moving right would be the most efficient next move as it brings us closer to the goal while keeping our options open.

I choose to move to position (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,2)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. We need to continue moving through empty spaces to reach G

Looking at the available moves from (2,2):
- We can move right to (2,3)
- We can move left to (2,1) (but this would be going backwards)

Since we need to reach the goal at (6,3), moving right to (2,3) is the clear choice as it continues our progress toward the goal.

I choose to move to position (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,3)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. We need to continue moving through empty spaces to reach G

Looking at the available moves from (2,3):
- We can move right to (2,4)
- We can move left to (2,2) (but this would be going backwards)

The path to the goal will require us to eventually move down, but we can't move down directly from our current position due to the wall at (3,3). However, we can see that there's an empty space at (3,4), which we can reach by first moving right.

I choose to move to position (2,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,4)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. We need to continue moving through empty spaces to reach G

Looking at the available moves from (2,4):
- We can move right to (2,5)
- We can move down to (3,4)
- We can move left to (2,3) (but this would be going backwards)

Since we need to get to the goal at (6,3), we need to start moving downward. There's a clear path down through (3,4) that will help us progress toward the goal.

I choose to move to position (3,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (3,4)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. We need to continue moving through empty spaces to reach G

Looking at the available moves from (3,4):
- We can move up to (2,4) (but this would be going backwards)
- We can move down to (4,3)

To reach the goal at (6,3), we need to continue moving downward and then left. There's a path through (4,3) that will lead us closer to the goal.

I choose to move to position (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Looking at the available moves from (4,3):
- We can move up to (3,4) (but this would be going backwards)
- We can move down to (5,2)

To reach the goal at (6,3), we need to continue moving down and then right. There's a path through (5,2) that will lead us to the goal.

I choose to move to position (5,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

2. The goal (G) remains at position (6,3)
3. We need to continue moving through empty spaces to reach G

Looking at the available moves from (5,2):
- We can move up to (4,3) (but this would be going backwards)
- We can move down to (6,2)
- We can move down-right to (6,3) - this is where the goal is!

Since we can move directly to the goal position with a diagonal move, this is clearly our best option.

I choose to move to position (6,3) to reach the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze and the path of empty spaces (corridors), I can observe that:

(1) The empty spaces form a general "Z" shape, starting from the top, moving horizontally right, then diagonally down-left, and finally horizontally right again at the bottom.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 1

This new maze:
- Maintains the same 7x7 dimensions
- Has a clear "Z" pattern in its empty spaces
- Provides a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze but preserves the characteristic Z-shape of the corridors
- The Z-shape is formed by a horizontal path at the top, a diagonal descent, and another horizontal path at the bottom
