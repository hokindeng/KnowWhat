You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,4)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I need to find a path from P to G through empty spaces (0s)

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach G, I need to move towards the left side first, using the empty spaces (0s) in row 2, and then find a way down.

For my first move, I'll move one step to the left.

Next position coordinates: (2,3)

This is a diagonal move from the current position and will get me closer to the goal while staying on empty spaces.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. I am now at (2,3)
2. The goal 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I need to continue moving left to get closer to the goal

I'll move one more step to the left.

Next position coordinates: (2,2)

This move keeps me on the path of empty spaces and continues to bring me closer to the goal position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. I am now at (2,2)
2. The goal 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I'm now directly above the goal position

Since I'm directly above the goal 'G', but there's a wall at (3,2) blocking direct downward movement, I need to find an alternate path. Looking at the available empty spaces, I can see I need to move down through the right side path.

I'll move one step to the right.

Next position coordinates: (2,3)

This will allow me to use the empty space at (3,3) in my next move to eventually reach the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. I am now at (3,3)
2. The goal 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I need to find a path around to reach the goal

From my current position, I can see that I need to go around to reach the goal. Looking at the available paths, I can see empty spaces leading to the left side of the maze through the bottom.

I'll move diagonally down-left.

Next position coordinates: (4,2)

This diagonal move will take me directly to the goal position 'G'.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

1. The empty spaces (corridors) form a rough "U" shape, starting from the top, going down one side, and coming back up the other side.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "U" shape pattern with its empty spaces, but with a different specific arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces still form a U-shape
- There's a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The layout is different from the original maze
- The U-shape is more clearly defined, with one vertical corridor on the right and another on the left, connected by a horizontal corridor at the bottom
