You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,4)
2. Goal 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I need to find a path from P to G through empty spaces (0s)

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach G, I need to move towards the left first, using the empty spaces (0s) in row 2.

For my first move, I'll move one step to the left.

Next position coordinates: (2,3)

This is a diagonal move from the current position and will get me closer to the goal while staying on empty spaces.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,3)
2. Goal 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I need to continue moving left to get closer to the goal

I'll move one more step to the left.

Next position coordinates: (2,2)

This move continues along the path of empty spaces and brings me closer to the goal position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,2)
2. Goal 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I'm now directly above the goal position

Since I'm directly above the goal 'G', but there's a wall at (3,2) blocking direct downward movement, I need to find another path. I can see that there's a path that goes left, down, and then right to reach the goal.

I'll move one step to the left.

Next position coordinates: (2,1)

This will allow me to eventually circle around to reach the goal position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,1)
2. Goal 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I need to continue finding a path around to reach the goal

I can see that I need to continue moving left and then down to eventually circle around to the goal.

I'll move one more step to the left.

Next position coordinates: (2,0)

This will allow me to use the path along the left side of the maze to eventually reach the goal position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,0)
2. Goal 'G' is at (4,2)
3. Now I can start moving down along the left edge

I can see that I can move down to the bottom row and then work my way back towards the goal.

I'll move diagonally down and right to position (3,1).

Next position coordinates: (6,0)

This will get me to the bottom path that I can use to eventually reach the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape, with one horizontal corridor at the top, another at the bottom, and a vertical connection on the left side.

2) Here's a new maze with the same "U" shape pattern but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 G 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1

This new maze maintains:
- The U-shaped corridor pattern
- Same 7x7 size
- Valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Different specific layout from original
- Recognizable U-shape formed by the corridors
