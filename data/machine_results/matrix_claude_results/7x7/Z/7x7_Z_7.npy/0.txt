You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,4)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I need to find a path from P to G through empty spaces (0s)

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach G, I need to move towards the left side first, using the empty spaces (0s) in row 2, and then find a way down.

For my first move, I'll move one step to the left.

Next position coordinates: (2,3)

This is a diagonal move from the current position and will get me closer to the goal while staying on empty spaces.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. I am now at (2,3)
2. The goal 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I need to continue moving left to get closer to the goal

I'll move one more step to the left.

Next position coordinates: (2,2)

This move keeps me on the path of empty spaces and continues to bring me closer to the goal position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. I am now at (2,2)
2. The goal 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I'm now directly above the goal position, but there's a wall at (3,2) blocking direct downward movement

Since I can move diagonally and I see that there's a path that goes down through the right side, I'll move back to the right.

Next position coordinates: (2,3)

This move will allow me to then move downward and eventually reach the goal through the available path.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. I am now at (2,3)
2. The goal 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I can see that I need to use the empty space below me to continue my path

I'll move one step down.

Next position coordinates: (3,3)

This move will put me in position to then move diagonally towards the goal position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. I am now at (3,3)
2. The goal 'G' is at (4,2)
3. From my current position, I can move diagonally up-left to reach the goal

I'll move diagonally up and left.

Next position coordinates: (2,2)

This move will put me back in position directly above the goal, but this time I have created a different path to reach it.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. I am now at (2,2)
2. The goal 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I need to find a way around the wall at (3,2)

Let me analyze the possible paths...
I see that I can go to the left side of the maze and use the empty spaces there to reach the bottom, then move right to reach the goal.

I'll move one step to the left.

Next position coordinates: (2,1)

This will start our path around the left side of the wall to eventually reach the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. I am now at (2,1)
2. The goal 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I can continue moving left and then down to find a path around

I'll move one more step to the left.

Next position coordinates: (2,0)

This will allow me to use the leftmost column of empty spaces to move downward and eventually reach the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. I am now at (2,0)
2. The goal 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I can see a path that goes down to the bottom row and then right

I'll move down to the bottom row.

Next position coordinates: (6,0)

This diagonal move will get me to the bottom row of empty spaces, from where I can then move right and up to reach the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1

1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape, with one horizontal corridor at the top, another at the bottom, and a vertical connection on the left side.

2) Here's a new maze with the same U-shape pattern:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze maintains the U-shape pattern of corridors but with a different specific arrangement. It still allows for a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces, and the U-shape is clearly recognizable.
