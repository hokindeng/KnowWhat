You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- Current position 'P' is at (0,4)
- Goal position 'G' is at (3,4)
- I need to reach the goal by moving through empty spaces ('0')

Looking at the available paths, I can see that I need to move downward towards the goal. The best next move would be to move one step down to coordinates (1,4), which is an empty space ('0').

I choose to move to: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at (1,4)
- The goal 'G' is at (3,4)
- I need to find a path through the empty spaces

I can see that I can't move directly down due to a wall at (2,4). However, I notice there's an empty space at (2,3) that I can reach by moving diagonally down-left. This will help me create a path to the goal.

I choose to move to: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at (2,3)
- The goal 'G' is at (3,4)
- I can see that I can move down to an empty space

From my current position, I can move down to (3,3), which will put me right next to the goal. This is the optimal next move as it will allow me to reach the goal in one more move after this.

I choose to move to: (3,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 P G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at (3,3)
- The goal 'G' is at (3,4)
- I'm right next to the goal!

I can simply move one step to the right to reach the goal position.

I choose to move to: (3,4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape - starting from the top right, moving diagonally down to the left, and then moving right again at the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern with its empty spaces, but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 0 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The "Z" shape is still present but slightly modified
- There's a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
- The pattern is different from the original but still recognizably forms a "Z"
- The walls (1s) ensure the integrity of the shape
