You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (4,3) (counting from 0, row then column)
Goal position 'G' is at (4,5)

Looking at the available moves:
- Can't move up (wall)
- Can move down and right to (5,4)
- Can move right to (4,5)
- Can move down to (5,3)
- Can move left to (3,3)
- Can move left and down to (3,4)

The most direct path to the goal would be to move down and right to position (5,4), as this gets us closer to 'G'.

I choose to move to coordinates: (5,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "Y" shape (or a fork pattern), with two paths at the top merging into a single path that leads to the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a Y shape, but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The Y shape is more symmetrical
- The two arms of the Y are equal in length
- The stem of the Y leads straight down to G
- The empty spaces still form a clear Y pattern
- P and G are positioned along the Y pattern
- It maintains valid pathfinding possibilities from P to G
