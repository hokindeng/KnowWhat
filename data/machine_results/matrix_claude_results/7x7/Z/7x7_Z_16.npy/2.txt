You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 P 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (0,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (0,5)

Looking at the maze, I can see that:
1. The goal 'G' is two spaces to the right of 'P' on the same row
2. There's an empty space (0) between P and G
3. Moving directly right is the most efficient path

Therefore, I choose to move one step right to coordinate (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 P G 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,4) and the goal 'G' is at (0,5), directly to my right.

Since there's a clear path to the goal with just one more move, I'll move right to coordinate (0,5) to reach the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

1. The empty spaces (corridors) form a rough "L" shape, with a horizontal segment at the top and a vertical segment on the right side of the maze.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shaped corridor but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 P 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The horizontal part of the "L" is at the top row
- The vertical part of the "L" runs down the second-to-last column
- The path from P to G is still valid and follows the L-shape
- The overall shape is the same as the original but with a cleaner, more defined L-pattern
