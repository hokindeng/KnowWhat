You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 P 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

I can see that:
- The current position 'P' is at (0,3)
- The goal 'G' is at (0,5)
- There's a clear path between P and G through the empty spaces (0s) in the top row

Since I can move in any direction including diagonals, and there's a direct path along the top row, the best move would be to move directly right towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,4), which is the empty space between P and G.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 P G 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,4) and the goal 'G' is right next to me at (0,5).

Since I can move directly to the goal position and there are no walls between my current position and the goal, I'll move to coordinates (0,5) to reach the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

(1) The empty spaces (corridors) form a rough "L" shape, with one segment along the top row and another segment going down vertically on the right side of the maze.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shaped corridor but with slightly different positioning:

1 P 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The horizontal part of the "L" is along the top row
- The vertical part of the "L" is one column to the left compared to the original
- The path from P to G is still valid and follows the L-shape
- The overall structure is recognizable as an "L" shape
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
