You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (2,5)
Goal position 'G' is at (4,3)

Looking at the maze, I need to move towards the goal by going through the available empty spaces ('0'). The most direct path would be to move diagonally down and left.

I'll move to coordinates (3,4), which is one step down and one step left from the current position. This is a valid move since it's an empty space ('0') and adjacent to the current position.

My next move coordinates are: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (3,4)
Goal position 'G' is at (4,3)

From my current position, I need to move towards the goal 'G'. The goal is one step down and one step left from my current position. Since diagonal moves are allowed and there's a direct path to the goal, I can move directly to it.

I'll move to coordinates (4,3), which is the goal position.

My next move coordinates are: (4,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "T" shape. The horizontal part of the T is formed by the three consecutive zeros in row 2, and the vertical part is formed by the zeros going down through the middle.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a T shape with its empty spaces, but with a slightly different arrangement while maintaining valid P-to-G connectivity:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The horizontal part of the T is formed by the three zeros in row 2
- The vertical part of the T goes straight down through the middle
- There's a valid path from P to G
- The overall T shape is preserved but with different proportions than the original
- The maze uses the same encoding system (1 for walls, 0 for corridors, P for player, G for goal)
