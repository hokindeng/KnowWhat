You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (2,5)
Goal position 'G' is at (4,3)

Looking at the maze, I need to move towards the goal by going through the available empty spaces ('0'). The most direct path would be to move diagonally down and left.

I'll move to coordinates (3,4), which is one step down and one step left from the current position. This is a valid move since it's an empty space ('0') and adjacent to the current position.

My next move coordinates are: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:

Current position 'P' is at (3,4)
Goal position 'G' is at (4,3)

From my current position, I need to move one step down and one step left to reach the goal. Since diagonal moves are allowed, I can move directly to the goal position in one move.

My next move coordinates are: (4,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "T" shape. The horizontal line of the T is formed by the three empty spaces at the top, and the vertical line is formed by the empty spaces leading down to the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a T shape, but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The horizontal bar of the T is formed by the empty spaces in row 2
- The vertical bar of the T goes down from the center of the horizontal bar to the goal
- The path from P to G is still valid and follows the T shape
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
- While the T shape is preserved, the specific arrangement of walls and spaces is different from the original maze
