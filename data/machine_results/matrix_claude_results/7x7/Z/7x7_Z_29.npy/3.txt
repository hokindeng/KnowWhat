You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (6,0)
Goal position 'G' is at (3,3)

Looking at the maze, I need to move towards the goal while staying on empty spaces ('0'). I can see there's a path going up through the empty spaces.

The best next move would be to move diagonally up-right to coordinate (5,1), as this gets me closer to the goal while staying on an empty space ('0').

I choose coordinates: (5,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:

I am now at position (5,1)
The goal 'G' is still at (3,3)

I need to continue moving upward through the available path of empty spaces ('0'). From my current position, I can see that I need to get to the row of empty spaces at row 3 that leads to the goal.

Looking at the available moves, I can move up-right to coordinate (4,2) which is an empty space ('0') and gets me closer to the goal.

I choose coordinates: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:

I am now at position (4,2)
The goal 'G' is at (3,3)

From my current position, I can see that I need to move up to reach the row of empty spaces that leads to the goal. There is an empty space directly above me.

The best move is to go up to coordinate (3,2), which puts me on the same row as the goal, and from there I can move right to reach it.

I choose coordinates: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:

I am now at position (3,2)
The goal 'G' is at (3,3)

I'm now on the same row as the goal, and it's directly to my right. The final move is simple - I just need to move right one space to reach the goal.

I choose coordinates: (3,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form:

1) A general "L" shape (or reversed "7" shape), with one segment running horizontally and another segment running vertically.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shaped corridor but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical segment of the "L" runs down from the goal
- The horizontal segment runs left from the bottom of the vertical segment
- The path is still navigable from P to G
- The overall "L" shape is maintained but rotated and positioned differently from the original
- The maze has the same 7x7 dimensions as the original
