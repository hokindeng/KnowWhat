You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- Current position 'P' is at (2,2)
- Goal 'G' is at (0,4)
- I need to find a path from P to G through empty spaces (0s)

Looking at the available paths:
1. I can move up-right diagonally to (1,3), which is an empty space (0)
2. From there, I can move up-right diagonally again to reach (0,4), which is the goal

For my next move, I choose to move to coordinates (1,3), which is the up-right diagonal move from the current position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1,3), I can now move up-right diagonally to reach the goal at (0,4).

I choose to move to coordinates (0,4), which will complete the path to the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a rough "L" shape, with one corridor going from top to bottom on the left side, and another corridor going from left to right at the top.

Here's my new maze with the same "L" shape pattern:

0 0 0 0 G 1 1
0 1 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 P 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
1. The empty spaces still form an "L" shape
2. There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
3. The maze has the same dimensions (7x7)
4. The pattern is different from the original but maintains the "L" shape characteristic
5. Both P and G are placed in positions that allow for a solution
