You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 P 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to move from the current position 'P' (at coordinates (2,2)) towards the goal 'G' (at coordinates (2,0)). Since diagonal moves are allowed and there's a clear path diagonally to the left, I'll move one step diagonally up-left.

My next move coordinates are: (2,1)

This will move me one step closer to the goal while staying on the empty path.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (2,1) and the goal 'G' is right next to me at (2,0). Since I can move directly left to reach the goal, that's what I'll do.

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

This will take me directly to the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces (corridors) form:

1) A general "L" shape, with one segment running horizontally at the bottom and another segment running vertically on the left side.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shaped corridor but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the "L" runs along the second column
- The horizontal part runs along the second-to-last row
- The "L" shape is still clearly visible
- There's a valid path from P to G
- The maze has the same 7x7 dimensions as the original
- The pattern is different from the original while maintaining the "L" shape concept
