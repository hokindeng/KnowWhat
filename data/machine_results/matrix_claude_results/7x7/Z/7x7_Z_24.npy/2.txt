You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. Player (P) is at position (0,3)
2. Goal (G) is at position (0,1)
3. There is a clear path between P and G through empty spaces (0s)

Since we can move in any direction including diagonals, and the goal is to the left of our current position, the most efficient move would be to move directly left to position (0,2).

I choose to move to coordinates: (0,2)

This will get us one step closer to the goal while staying on empty spaces.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G P 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now we're at position (0,2), and the Goal (G) is just one step to our left at (0,1).

Since we can move directly left to reach the goal, I choose to move to coordinates: (0,1)

This will complete the maze by reaching the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a rough "L" shape, with one segment running horizontally along the top and another segment running vertically down.

Here's my answer:

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces is an "L" shape.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shape pattern of empty spaces but with a slightly different arrangement:

P 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is still present but slightly modified
- There is still a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
- The layout is different from the original while preserving the "L" shape concept
