You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (3,1)
Goal position 'G' is at (0,4)

Looking at the available moves from the current position:
- Up: blocked by wall
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: empty space at (3,2)
- Up-right: empty space at (2,2)
- Up-left: blocked by wall
- Down-right: blocked by wall
- Down-left: blocked by wall

The goal is northeast of our current position, so we should try to move in that general direction. The best move appears to be moving up-right to coordinate (2,2), as this will help us get closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

I choose to move to coordinate (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (2,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (0,4)

Looking at the available moves from the current position:
- Up: empty space at (1,2)
- Down: empty space at (3,2)
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall
- Up-right: empty space at (1,3)
- Up-left: blocked by wall
- Down-right: empty space at (3,3)
- Down-left: blocked by wall

Since the goal is northeast of our current position, we should continue moving upward and to the right when possible. The best move appears to be moving up-right to coordinate (1,3), as this will get us closer to the goal while avoiding walls.

I choose to move to coordinate (1,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (1,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (0,4)

Looking at the available moves from the current position:
- Up: empty space at (0,3)
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall
- Up-right: goal at (0,4)
- Up-left: empty space at (0,2)
- Down-right: blocked by wall
- Down-left: blocked by wall

We're very close to the goal now! Since we can see the goal diagonally up and to the right, and that move is available to us, that's clearly our best option.

I choose to move to coordinate (0,4) where the goal 'G' is located.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape (or reversed "7" shape), with one corridor going up and another extending to the right.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shaped corridor but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the "L" is moved one column to the right compared to the original
- The horizontal part remains similar but slightly modified
- It still maintains a valid path from P to G
- The overall "L" shape of the corridor is preserved
- The maze dimensions are the same (7x7)
- The start and end positions create a similar traversal challenge
