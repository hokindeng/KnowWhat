You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (3,1)
Goal position 'G' is at (0,4)

Looking at the available moves from the current position:
- Up: blocked by wall
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: empty space at (3,2)
- Up-right: empty space at (2,2)
- Up-left: blocked by wall
- Down-right: blocked by wall
- Down-left: blocked by wall

The goal is northeast of our current position, so we should try to move in that general direction. The best move appears to be moving right to coordinate (3,2), as this will give us access to the path leading up to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (3,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current position 'P' is at (3,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (0,4)

Looking at the available moves from the current position:
- Up: empty space at (2,2)
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: empty space at (3,1)
- Right: empty space at (3,3)
- Up-right: blocked by wall
- Up-left: blocked by wall
- Down-right: blocked by wall
- Down-left: blocked by wall

Since we need to get to the goal which is above and to the right of our current position, and we have an empty space above us that will help us progress upward, the best move is to go up to coordinate (2,2).

I choose to move to coordinate (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current position 'P' is at (2,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (0,4)

Looking at the available moves from the current position:
- Up: blocked by wall
- Down: empty space at (3,2)
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall
- Up-right: blocked by wall
- Up-left: empty space at (1,1)
- Down-right: empty space at (3,3)
- Down-left: empty space at (3,1)

We need to reach the goal which is up and to the right. Looking at the maze, we can see that we need to go up-left to eventually access the path that leads to the goal. The empty space at (1,1) will allow us to progress in that direction.

I choose to move to coordinate (1,1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1) The empty spaces form a general "Z" shape (or reverse "Z" shape, depending on perspective). The path starts at the bottom, goes right, then diagonally up to the left, and then right again at the top to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze with a similar "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 0 0 G 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze, the "Z" shape is maintained but shifted slightly, while still providing a valid path from P to G through empty spaces.
