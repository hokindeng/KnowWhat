You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The player (P) is at position (1,3)
- The goal (G) is at position (3,2)
- I need to find a path from P to G

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach the goal, I need to move down and left. The best first move would be to move down to the empty space at (2,3).

I choose to move to coordinates: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (2,3), and I need to reach G at (3,2). Looking at the available moves, I can move diagonally down-left to reach the goal position directly.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "T" shape, with the vertical line of the T running from top to bottom in the middle, and the horizontal line crossing it near the top.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a T shape but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical line of the T runs down the middle
- The horizontal line of the T is at the top
- P and G are placed along the T shape
- The path between P and G is valid through empty spaces
- The overall T shape is maintained but with different proportions than the original
