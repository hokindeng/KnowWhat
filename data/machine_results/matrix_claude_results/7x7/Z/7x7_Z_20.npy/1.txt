You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (5,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (5,4)
3. There are empty spaces (0) that create a path between P and G

Looking at the available moves from the current position (5,1), I can move:
- Right to (5,2) which is an empty space
- Up-right diagonally to (4,2) which is an empty space

Since the goal is to the right of the current position, moving right would be the most direct path.

I choose to move to position (5,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current position (5,2), I can see that:
1. The goal (G) is at position (5,4)
2. I can move:
   - Right to (5,3) which is an empty space
   - Up-right diagonally to (4,3) which is an empty space

Since the goal is to the right, and there's a clear path to it, the most direct route would be to continue moving right.

I choose to move to position (5,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current position (5,3), I can see that:
1. The goal (G) is at position (5,4)
2. I can move right to (5,4), which is the goal position

Since I'm directly adjacent to the goal, I'll make the final move.

I choose to move to position (5,4), which is the goal position (G).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "U" shape, with the bottom of the U being where the solution path is, and the vertical parts of the U extending upward in the second and fifth columns.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a U-shaped corridor pattern but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 P 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The U shape is more symmetrical
- The vertical parts of the U are in columns 1 and 5
- The bottom of the U is in row 4
- The path from P to G requires going up, following the U shape, and then coming back down
- The maze maintains the same dimensions and encoding scheme as the original
