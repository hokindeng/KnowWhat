You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

Current observations:
- Player (P) is at position (5,5)
- Goal (G) is at position (1,5)
- There appears to be a path going up through the empty spaces (0s)

For the next move, I should move upward to get closer to the goal. The space directly above the player at (4,5) is a wall (1), but there is an empty space at (5,4).

I choose to move to coordinates (5,4), which is one step to the left of the current position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
- Player (P) is now at (5,4)
- Goal (G) remains at (1,5)
- I need to continue moving upward through the available path

I can see there's an empty space (0) directly above my current position at (4,3).

I choose to move to coordinates (4,3), which will help me progress toward the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
- Player (P) is now at (4,3)
- Goal (G) remains at (1,5)
- I need to continue moving upward and then right to reach the goal

From my current position, I can see an empty space (0) at (3,4) which will help me progress toward the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (3,4), moving up and right diagonally.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
- Player (P) is now at (3,4)
- Goal (G) remains at (1,5)
- I need to continue moving upward to reach the goal

From my current position, I can see an empty space (0) at (2,4), which will help me progress toward the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (2,2), moving up and left diagonally to the empty space at (2,2). This will give me a clear path to the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

1) The empty spaces (corridors) form a rough "Z" shape, starting from the bottom right, moving left, then diagonally up to the right, and finally left again at the top.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Maintains the same 7x7 dimensions
- Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms a "Z" shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze but preserves the essential shape pattern
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for paths, P for player, G for goal)
