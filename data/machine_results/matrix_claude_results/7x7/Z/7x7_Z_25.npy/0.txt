You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 G 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. Player (P) is at position (6,5)
2. Goal (G) is at position (0,3)
3. Need to move diagonally up-left to reach the goal through the empty spaces

From position (6,5), I can move to any adjacent empty space. Looking at the available options, I can see empty spaces at:
- Up: (5,5) - blocked by wall
- Left: (6,4) - empty space
- Right: (6,6) - empty space
- Up-left: (5,4) - empty space
- Up-right: (5,6) - blocked by wall
- Left: (6,4) - empty space
- Down-left: not relevant (outside maze)
- Down-right: not relevant (outside maze)

The best move would be to go up-left diagonally to position (5,4), as this brings us closer to the goal while staying on the path of empty spaces.

I choose to move to coordinates: (5,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), starting from the top row, moving diagonally down-right, and then across the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern with its empty spaces, but with a different arrangement of walls:

0 0 0 G 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 0 0

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions (7x7)
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms a "Z" shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general pattern
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
