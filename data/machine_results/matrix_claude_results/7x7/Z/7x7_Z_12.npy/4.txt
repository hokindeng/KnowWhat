You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,3)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,5)
3. I need to find a path from P to G through empty spaces (0s)

Looking at the available moves from the current position (2,3):
- I can move right to (2,4), which is an empty space
- This would get me closer to the goal

The best next move would be to position (2,4), moving right from the current position.

I choose coordinates: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,4)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,5)
3. I can see that I need to continue moving towards the goal

From my current position (2,4), I can:
- Move right to (2,5), which is an empty space
- This continues to move me closer to the goal position

The best next move would be to position (2,5), moving right from the current position.

I choose coordinates: (2,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,5)
2. Goal 'G' is at (3,5)
3. I need to move down to reach the goal

From my current position (2,5), I can:
- Move down to (3,5), which is where the goal 'G' is
- This is a direct move to the goal position

The best next move would be to position (3,5), moving down to reach the goal.

I choose coordinates: (3,5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form:

(1) A backwards "L" shape (or an inverted "7" shape)

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a backwards "L" shape, but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces still form a backwards "L" shape
- There is a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- The shape is recognizable but positioned differently than in the original
- The maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions
- The path follows the vertical and horizontal segments of the backwards "L"

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
