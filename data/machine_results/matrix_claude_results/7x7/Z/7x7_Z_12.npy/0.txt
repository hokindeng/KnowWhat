You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- Current position 'P' is at (2,3)
- Goal position 'G' is at (3,5)
- I can move through empty spaces '0'
- I need to reach 'G' using the shortest possible path

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach the goal, I need to move towards the right and then down. The best next move would be to move right to coordinate (2,4), which is an empty space ('0').

I choose to move to coordinates: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2,4) and need to continue moving towards the goal at (3,5).

Looking at the available moves, I can see that moving right to (2,5) is the best option as it gets me closer to the goal position.

I choose to move to coordinates: (2,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2,5) and the goal 'G' is at (3,5), directly below me.

Since I can move diagonally and the goal is right below my current position, I can move directly to it.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape, with one corridor going from left to right and another going down.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an "L" shape but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The horizontal part of the "L" is at the top
- The vertical part of the "L" goes down
- There's a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The shape is still recognizably an "L"
- The maze has different empty space positions while maintaining the same general shape
- The size remains 7x7

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
