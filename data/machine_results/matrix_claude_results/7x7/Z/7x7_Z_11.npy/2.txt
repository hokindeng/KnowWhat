You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 0 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- Current position P is at (4,3)
- Goal position G is at (5,0)
- I can move through empty spaces (0)
- I can move in any direction (including diagonals)

Looking at the available paths, I can see that I need to move upward and then right to reach the goal. The best next move would be to move up-right diagonally to position (3,4), which is an empty space (0).

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape (or an inverted "7" shape), with one corridor going up and another extending to the right.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shaped corridor but with slightly different wall placements:

1 1 1 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is still present
- The path from P to G is still valid
- The layout is different from the original but maintains the same general shape
- The walls and corridors are arranged differently while preserving the basic "L" structure
- The maze size remains 7x7
