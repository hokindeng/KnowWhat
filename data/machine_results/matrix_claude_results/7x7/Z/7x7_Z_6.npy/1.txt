You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the optimal path.

Current position 'P' is at (6,0)
Goal position 'G' is at (1,3)

Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to move upward and right to reach the goal. Since diagonal moves are allowed, I'll start by moving diagonally up-right.

I choose to move to coordinates (5,1), which is currently marked as '0'.

This diagonal move will get me closer to the goal while staying on a valid path.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5,1), I need to continue moving upward and right to reach the goal at (1,3).

Looking at the available paths, I can see that I need to use the path of '0's that leads up to the goal. I'll move diagonally up-left to position (4,0), which is currently marked as '0'.

I choose to move to coordinates (4,0).

This move will keep me on a valid path while getting closer to the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 0 1

1) The empty spaces form a "Y" shape (or fork shape), with:
- A horizontal base at the bottom
- Two branching paths that split upward
- One branch leading to the goal

2) Here's a new maze with a similar Y-shaped corridor pattern:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 1

This new maze maintains:
- The Y-shape pattern of corridors
- A valid path from P to G
- The same dimensions as the original
- A different wall arrangement while keeping the basic Y-shape concept
