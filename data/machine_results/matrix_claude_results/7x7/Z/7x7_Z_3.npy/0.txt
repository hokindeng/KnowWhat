You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (5,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (1,0)
3. We need to move towards the top-left of the maze

Looking at the possible moves from the current position (5,1):
- Up: (4,1) - blocked by wall
- Up-right: (4,2) - blocked by wall
- Right: (5,2) - empty space
- Down-right: (6,2) - blocked by wall
- Down: (6,1) - blocked by wall
- Down-left: (6,0) - blocked by wall
- Left: (5,0) - empty space
- Up-left: (4,0) - blocked by wall

Since we need to get to the top-left where the goal is, and there's an empty path leading left, I choose to move to position (5,0).

My next move coordinates are: 5,0

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (5,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (1,0)
3. We need to continue moving upward to reach the goal

Looking at the possible moves from the current position (5,0):
- Up: (4,0) - blocked by wall
- Up-right: (4,1) - blocked by wall
- Right: (5,1) - empty space
- Down-right: (6,1) - blocked by wall
- Down: (6,0) - blocked by wall
- Down-left: (6,-1) - out of bounds
- Left: (5,-1) - out of bounds
- Up-left: (4,-1) - out of bounds

Since we need to get to the top where the goal is, and there's an empty path leading right and then up through the maze, I'll move right to begin navigating that path.

My next move coordinates are: 5,1

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "U" shape, with one vertical corridor on the left side, one on the right side, and a horizontal corridor at the bottom connecting them.

Here's my new maze design that maintains this U-shape pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 0 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
1. Has the same 7x7 dimensions
2. Maintains a U-shaped corridor pattern
3. Has a valid path from P to G
4. Is different from the original but recognizably similar in its overall shape
5. Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for corridors, P for player, G for goal)

The main differences are:
- The vertical corridors are straighter
- The connecting horizontal corridor at the bottom is similar
- The wall configuration between the vertical corridors is different
- The path to the goal is more direct
