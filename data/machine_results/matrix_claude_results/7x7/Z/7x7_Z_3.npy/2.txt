You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. Player position (P) is at (5,1)
2. Goal position (G) is at (1,0)
3. We can move in any direction (including diagonals) through empty spaces

Looking at the maze, we need to move towards the goal which is in the upper-left corner. The best path appears to be moving upward and then left through the available empty spaces.

From the current position (5,1), I recommend moving to coordinate (5,0) - which is the empty space directly to the left of the current position. This will begin our path towards the goal while staying on empty spaces.

My next move: (5,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (5,0), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (1,0).

Looking at the available paths, I can see that I need to move upward through the empty spaces. The next logical move would be to the empty space at (4,0), which is directly above my current position.

My next move: (4,0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "U" shape, with one vertical corridor on the left side, one on the right side, and a horizontal corridor at the bottom connecting them.

Here's my answer:

1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "U" shape.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a U-shaped corridor pattern but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The U shape is more symmetrical
- The vertical corridors are straighter
- The horizontal bottom corridor is similar
- There's still a valid path from P to G
- The overall shape of the empty spaces clearly forms a U
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
