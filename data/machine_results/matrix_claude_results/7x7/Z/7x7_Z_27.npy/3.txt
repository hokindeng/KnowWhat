You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (3,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (6,4)

Looking at the available moves from the current position (3,3):
- Right (3,4): empty space '0'
- Down-right (4,4): wall '1'

Since we need to get to the goal at (6,4), and we can only move through empty spaces, I'll move to the right to position (3,4).

My next move coordinates are: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current position 'P' is at (3,4)
Goal position 'G' is at (6,4)

Looking at the available moves from (3,4):
- Right (3,5): empty space '0'
- Left (3,3): empty space '0'

Since we need to reach (6,4), and there's a path through the bottom of the maze, I'll move right to position (3,5).

My next move coordinates are: (3,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current position 'P' is at (3,5)
Goal position 'G' is at (6,4)

Looking at the available moves from (3,5):
- Right (3,6): empty space '0'
- Down (4,5): wall '1'
- Left (3,4): empty space '0'

Since we need to reach (6,4), and there's a path that goes down through the right side, I'll move right to position (3,6).

My next move coordinates are: (3,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current position 'P' is at (3,6)
Goal position 'G' is at (6,4)

Looking at the available moves from (3,6):
- Down (4,6): wall '1'
- Left (3,5): empty space '0'

Since we need to reach (6,4), and there's a path that goes through the middle of the maze using the empty spaces, I'll move left to position (3,5) to access that path.

My next move coordinates are: (3,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current position 'P' is at (3,5)
Goal position 'G' is at (6,4)

Looking at the available moves from (3,5):
- Right (3,6): empty space '0'
- Down (4,5): wall '1'
- Left (3,4): empty space '0'

I notice that to reach the goal at (6,4), we need to use the empty space at (5,4) to get there. From my current position, I can see that there's a path down through (4,5) that will lead us to the goal. 

I'll move down-right to position (4,6) where there's an empty space '0'.

My next move coordinates are: (4,6)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

(1) The empty spaces form a "Z" shape. Starting from the top right, there's a horizontal corridor, then a diagonal corridor going down-left, and finally another horizontal corridor at the bottom.

(2) Here's a new maze with a "Z" shaped path:

1 1 1 1 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 1 1 1

This new maze maintains:
- The 7x7 dimensions
- A "Z" shaped corridor of empty spaces
- A valid path from P to G
- A different arrangement from the original while keeping the "Z" shape recognizable
