You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position (P) is at (3,3)
Goal position (G) is at (6,4)

Looking at the available paths:
- There are empty spaces ('0') to the right of P
- We need to move towards the goal which is down and to the right

The most efficient path would be to move to the empty space at (3,4), which is directly to the right of the current position.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the path to the goal.

Current position (P) is at (3,4)
Goal position (G) is at (6,4)

Looking at the available paths:
- There are empty spaces ('0') to the right
- We need to continue moving towards the goal which is down and slightly to the right
- There's an empty space at (5,4) that will lead us directly to the goal

The best next move would be to the empty space at (3,5), continuing to move right to maintain a path to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the path to the goal.

Current position (P) is at (3,5)
Goal position (G) is at (6,4)

Looking at the available paths:
- There's an empty space ('0') to the right
- We need to get to the goal which is down and slightly to the left
- There's an empty space at (5,4) that leads to the goal
- We can move to (4,5) which is the empty space directly below us

The best next move would be to move down to (4,5), as this gets us closer to the path that leads to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the path to the goal.

Current position (P) is at (4,5)
Goal position (G) is at (6,4)

Looking at the available paths:
- There's an empty space ('0') at (5,4) that will lead us to the goal
- We can move diagonally down-left to reach this space

The best next move would be to move diagonally down and left to (5,4), which will put us right next to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the path to the goal.

Current position (P) is at (5,4)
Goal position (G) is at (6,4)

We're now directly above the goal position. The simplest move is to go straight down to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (6,4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

(1) The empty spaces form a general "Z" shape, with a horizontal line at the top, a diagonal line in the middle, and a horizontal line at the bottom.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size with a similar "Z" shape pattern, but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 1 1 1

This new maze maintains:
- The same 7x7 dimensions
- A "Z" shape formed by empty spaces
- A valid path from P to G
- A different arrangement from the original while keeping the same general shape
