You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (3,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (6,4)

Looking at the available moves from the current position (3,3):
- Right: (3,4) is an empty space '0'
- Down-right: (4,4) is a wall '1'

Since we need to get to the goal at (6,4), and we can only move through empty spaces, the best next move is to move right to coordinate (3,4).

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current position 'P' is at (3,4)
Goal position 'G' is at (6,4)

Looking at the available moves from (3,4):
- Right: (3,5) is an empty space '0'
- Left: (3,3) is an empty space '0'

Since we need to reach (6,4), and we can see there's a path going down through empty spaces that leads to the goal, moving right to (3,5) will bring us closer to that path.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current position 'P' is at (3,5)
Goal position 'G' is at (6,4)

Looking at the available moves from (3,5):
- Right: (3,6) is an empty space '0'
- Down: (4,5) is a wall '0'
- Left: (3,4) is an empty space '0'

Since we need to reach (6,4), and we can see there's a path that goes right and then down through empty spaces that will lead to the goal, moving right to (3,6) is the best choice.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current position 'P' is at (3,6)
Goal position 'G' is at (6,4)

Looking at the available moves from (3,6):
- Down: (4,6) is a wall '1'
- Left: (3,5) is an empty space '0'

We need to get to (6,4), and I can see that we need to go through the empty space at (4,5) to reach the goal. Since we can't move directly down from our current position due to the wall, we should move back left to (3,5) to find a path down.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current position 'P' is at (3,5)
Goal position 'G' is at (6,4)

Looking at the available moves from (3,5):
- Right: (3,6) is an empty space '0'
- Down: (4,5) is an empty space '0'
- Left: (3,4) is an empty space '0'

Now we can move down through the empty space at (4,5), which will get us closer to the goal position at (6,4).

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current position 'P' is at (4,5)
Goal position 'G' is at (6,4)

Looking at the available moves from (4,5):
- Up: (3,5) is an empty space '0'
- Down: (5,5) is a wall '1'
- Left: (4,4) is a wall '1'
- Right: (4,6) is a wall '1'
- Down-left: (5,4) is an empty space '0'

We need to reach (6,4), and there's an empty space at (5,4) that will bring us closer to the goal. Moving down-left is the best option.

I choose to move to coordinates: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0

1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current position 'P' is at (5,4)
Goal position 'G' is at (6,4)

Looking at the available moves from (5,4):
- Up: (4,4) is a wall '1'
- Down: (6,4) is the goal 'G'
- Left: (5,3) is a wall '1'
- Right: (5,5) is a wall '1'

We can move directly down to reach the goal position at (6,4).

I choose to move to coordinates: (6,4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze and the path of empty spaces:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

(1) The empty spaces form a general "Z" shape, with a horizontal line at the top, a diagonal line in the middle, and a horizontal line at the bottom.

(2) Here's a new maze with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1 1
1 G 0 0 1 1 1

This new maze maintains:
- The same 7x7 size
- A "Z" shape formed by empty spaces
- A valid path from P to G
- A different arrangement from the original while keeping the "Z" shape recognizable
