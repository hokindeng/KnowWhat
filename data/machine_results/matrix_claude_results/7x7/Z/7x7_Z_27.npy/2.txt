You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position (P) is at (3,3)
Goal position (G) is at (6,4)

Looking at the available paths:
- There are empty spaces ('0') to the right of P
- We need to move towards the goal which is down and to the right

The most efficient path would be to move to the empty space at (3,4), which is directly to the right of the current position.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the path to the goal.

Current position (P) is at (3,4)
Goal position (G) is at (6,4)

Looking at the available paths:
- There are empty spaces ('0') to the right
- We need to continue moving towards the goal which is down and slightly to the right
- We can see that we'll need to go through the empty space at (5,4) to reach the goal

The best next move would be to move to the empty space at (3,5), continuing to the right.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the path to the goal.

Current position (P) is at (3,5)
Goal position (G) is at (6,4)

Looking at the available paths:
- There's an empty space ('0') to the right
- We need to get to the goal which is down and slightly to the left
- We can see that we need to use the empty space at (5,4) to reach the goal
- The path through (4,5) to (5,4) looks most efficient

The best next move would be to move to the empty space at (4,5), moving down.

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the path to the goal.

Current position (P) is at (4,5)
Goal position (G) is at (6,4)

Looking at the available paths:
- There's an empty space ('0') at (5,4) which leads to the goal
- We need to move down and left to reach the goal
- The empty space at (5,4) is crucial as it connects to the goal position

The best next move would be to move to the empty space at (5,4), moving down and left diagonally.

I choose to move to coordinates: (5,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the path to the goal.

Current position (P) is at (5,4)
Goal position (G) is at (6,4)

Looking at the available paths:
- The goal (G) is directly below our current position
- We can move straight down to reach it

The best (and final) move would be to move to the goal position at (6,4).

I choose to move to coordinates: (6,4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape, with one corridor extending horizontally and another vertically.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement while maintaining the same basic concept:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 G 1

In this new maze:
- The horizontal part of the "L" is at the top
- The vertical part of the "L" extends downward
- P and G are positioned at opposite ends of the "L"
- The path is still navigable
- The overall dimensions are maintained at 7x7
- The "L" shape is clearly recognizable but distinct from the original maze's implementation
