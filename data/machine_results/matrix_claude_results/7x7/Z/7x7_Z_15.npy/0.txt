You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (5,4)
3. There are empty spaces (0) connecting these positions

Looking at the available moves from the current position (4,2):
- We can move up: blocked by wall
- We can move down: there's an empty space at (5,2)
- We can move left: blocked by wall
- We can move right: blocked by wall
- We can move diagonally down-right: there's an empty space at (5,3)

The most efficient path to reach the goal would be to move towards the empty spaces that lead to G.

I choose to move to position (5,2), as this will give us access to the horizontal path leading to the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (5,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. The player (P) is now at position (5,2)
2. The goal (G) remains at position (5,4)
3. There's a clear horizontal path to the goal

From the current position (5,2), I can:
- Move right: there's an empty space at (5,3), which will bring me closer to the goal

The most efficient move is to continue moving right along the horizontal path towards the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (5,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. The player (P) is now at position (5,3)
2. The goal (G) is right next to us at position (5,4)
3. We can reach the goal in one move

From the current position (5,3), the obvious move is to go right to reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (5,4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a rough "T" shape, with:
- A horizontal line at the bottom
- A vertical line extending upward from the middle of the horizontal line
- The top of the T reaching the top edge of the maze

Here's my new maze design that maintains this T-shape pattern:

1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
1. Has the same 7x7 dimensions
2. Maintains a T-shaped corridor pattern
3. Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
4. Is different from the original maze but preserves the general T-shape
5. Places P at the top of the T and G along the horizontal base
6. Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for paths, P for player, G for goal)
