You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the optimal path from P to G.

Current position (P) is at (4,0)
Goal position (G) is at (2,2)

Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to move upward and then right to reach the goal. The best path would be to first move diagonally up-right to utilize the empty spaces efficiently.

For my first move, I'll move diagonally up-right to coordinate (3,1).

My next move coordinates are: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (3,1), and I need to reach G at (2,2).

Looking at the available moves, I can see that I need to move up and then right to reach the goal. The best path would be to first move up to the empty space in the second row.

I'll move up to coordinate (1,1).

My next move coordinates are: (1,1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

1) The empty spaces (corridors) form a rough "L" shape, with one segment running horizontally along the bottom and another segment running vertically up the left side.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shaped corridor but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical segment of the "L" is positioned more towards the middle
- The horizontal segment remains at the bottom
- There is still a valid path from P to G
- The overall "L" shape of the corridors is preserved
- The maze is different from the original but maintains the same basic concept
