You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (3,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (0,5)

Looking at the available moves from the current position (3,3):
- Up is blocked by a wall (1)
- Down is blocked by a wall (1)
- Left has an empty space (0)
- Right is blocked by a wall (1)
- Diagonals are mostly blocked

The best path to reach the goal appears to be:
1. Move left to the empty space
2. Then move up through the empty spaces
3. Finally move right to reach the goal

Therefore, for my first move, I choose to move left to coordinates (3,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
Current position 'P' is at (3,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (0,5)

From my current position (3,2), I can see:
- Up is blocked by a wall (1)
- Down has an empty space (0)
- Left is blocked by a wall (1)
- Right is blocked by a wall (1)
- Some diagonals are open

The best path to reach the goal is to:
1. Move down to access the open corridor
2. Then move right and up through the empty spaces
3. Finally reach the goal

Therefore, I choose to move down to coordinates (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
Current position 'P' is at (4,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (0,5)

From my current position (4,2), I can see:
- Up is blocked
- Down is blocked by a wall (1)
- Left is blocked by a wall (1)
- Right has an empty space (0)
- Some diagonals are blocked

The best path to reach the goal is to:
1. Move right through the open corridor
2. Then move up through the empty spaces
3. Finally reach the goal

Therefore, I choose to move right to coordinates (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1

Goal position 'G' is at (0,5)

From my current position (4,3), I can see:
- Up is blocked by a wall (1)
- Down is blocked by a wall (1)
- Left has an empty space (0)
- Right has an empty space (0)
- Some diagonals are blocked

The best path to reach the goal is to:
1. Continue moving right through the corridor
2. Then move up through the empty spaces
3. Finally reach the goal

Therefore, I choose to move right to coordinates (4,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1

From my current position (4,4), I can see:
- Up is blocked by a wall (1)
- Down is blocked by a wall (1)
- Left has an empty space (0)
- Right has an empty space (0)
- Some diagonals are blocked

The best path to reach the goal is to:
1. Continue moving right to the last empty space in this corridor
2. Then move up through the empty spaces
3. Finally reach the goal

Therefore, I choose to move right to coordinates (4,5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
Current position 'P' is at (4,5)
Goal position 'G' is at (0,5)

From my current position (4,5), I can see:
- Up is blocked by a wall (1)
- Down is blocked by a wall (1)
- Left has an empty space (0)
- Right is blocked by a wall (1)
- The diagonal up-left leads to an empty space (0)

The best path to reach the goal is to:
1. Move diagonally up and left to access the empty space
2. Then continue up to reach the goal

Therefore, I choose to move diagonally up-left to coordinates (3,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form:

(1) A "U" shape (or horseshoe shape), where there's a corridor that goes down, across, and back up.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size with a U-shaped path:

1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms a U shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
- The U shape is rotated 90 degrees compared to the original, but still maintains the characteristic down-across-up pattern
