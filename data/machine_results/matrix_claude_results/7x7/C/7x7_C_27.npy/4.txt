You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,3)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (1,3)
3. I need to move up to reach the goal

Since I can move up, down, left, or right to any adjacent empty space (0), and I can see that there's a clear path upward to reach the goal, I'll move up.

My next move coordinates are: (2,3)

This will move the player one step up from the current position, getting closer to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I can see that I'm now at (2,3) and the goal 'G' is just one step up at (1,3).

Since there's a clear path upward and this will lead directly to the goal, I'll move up one more space.

My next move coordinates are: (1,3)

This move will take me directly to the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "T" shape, with the vertical line running from the bottom to the top-center, and the horizontal line across the top.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a "T" shape but with a slightly different arrangement while maintaining a valid path from P to G:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions (7x7)
- Forms a "T" shape with its corridors
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze (the vertical part of the T is longer)
- Maintains the same encoding where 1=wall, 0=empty space, P=player, G=goal
