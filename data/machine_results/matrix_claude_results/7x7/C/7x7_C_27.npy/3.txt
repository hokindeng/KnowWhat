You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,3)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (1,3)
3. I need to move up to reach the goal

Since I can move up, down, left, or right (when there are empty spaces), and I can see that there's a clear path upward to reach the goal, I'll move up.

My next move should be to coordinate (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 0 0 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2,3) and the goal 'G' is at (1,3). 

Looking at the maze, I can see that I can move up one more space to reach the goal position.

My next move should be to coordinate (1,3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "T" shape, with the vertical line running from the bottom to the middle, and the horizontal line at the top extending to the right.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a "T" shape, but with slightly different positioning while maintaining the same basic structure:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical line of the T runs from the bottom up
- The horizontal line of the T is at the top
- There's still a valid path from P to G
- The T shape is maintained but positioned differently than in the original
- The maze has the same 7x7 dimensions
