You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,6) (counting from top-left, 0-based)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (0,4)
3. I need to move through empty spaces ('0') to reach the goal

Looking at the maze, I can see that there's a path of empty spaces leading from the current position towards the goal. The best first move would be to move left, as that's the direction that will lead us towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (2,6), which is one space to the left of the current position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 P 1 1 1

(1) The empty spaces form an "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation).

(2) Here's a new maze with the same size and an "L" shaped corridor:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 P 0

This new maze maintains:
- The same 7x7 dimensions
- An L-shaped corridor of empty spaces
- A valid path from P to G
- A different arrangement from the original while keeping the L shape
- The same encoding system (1 for walls, 0 for paths, P for player, G for goal)
