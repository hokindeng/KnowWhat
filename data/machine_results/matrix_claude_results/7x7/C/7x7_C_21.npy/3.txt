You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (5,4)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (3,5)
3. I need to move upward to reach the goal

Looking at the available paths:
- I can move up from my current position as there's an empty space '0' at (4,4)
- This will get me closer to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move UP to coordinates (4,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,4)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (3,5)
3. I need to move up and then right to reach the goal

Looking at the available paths:
- I can move up from my current position as there's an empty space '0' at (3,4)
- This will get me closer to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move UP to coordinates (3,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 P G 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,4)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (3,5)
3. I'm now directly to the left of the goal

Looking at the available paths:
- I can move right from my current position to reach the goal at (3,5)
- This will complete the maze

Therefore, I choose to move RIGHT to coordinates (3,5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form an "L" shape (or an inverted "L" shape when viewed from top to bottom).

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different configuration:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is rotated 90 degrees compared to the original
- The path still connects P to G through empty spaces
- The maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions
- The shape is still recognizable as an "L"
- The starting position P and goal G are placed at different positions but are still connected via the L-shaped corridor
