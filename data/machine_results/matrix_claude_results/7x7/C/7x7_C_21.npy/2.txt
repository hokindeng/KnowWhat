You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (5,4)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (3,5)
3. I need to move upward to reach the goal

Looking at the available paths, I can see that I need to move up through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

I'll make my first move upward from (5,4) to (4,4).

My next move coordinates are: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,4)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (3,5)
3. I need to move up and then right to reach the goal

From my current position (4,4), I'll move up to (3,4) to get closer to the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 P G 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,4)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (3,5)
3. I'm right next to the goal

From my current position (3,4), I'll move right to (3,5) to reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (3,5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

1. The empty spaces form an "L" shape (or an inverted "L" shape, depending on perspective)
2. The path requires moving up and then right to reach the goal

Here's my answer:

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces is an "L" shape.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with an "L" shaped corridor:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is rotated 90 degrees compared to the original
- The path still requires two moves (right then down)
- The shape is still clearly recognizable as an "L"
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
