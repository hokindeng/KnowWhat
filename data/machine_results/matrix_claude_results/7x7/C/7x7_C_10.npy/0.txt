You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 P 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (5,5)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (2,4)
3. There's a clear path going up through the empty spaces ('0')

To reach the goal, I need to move upward through the available path. The first move should be to move one space up from my current position.

I choose to move to coordinates (5,4), which is the empty space directly above the current position 'P'.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 P 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I need to continue moving upward to reach the goal. From my current position at (5,4), I'll move one space up to coordinates (4,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a "T" shape, with the vertical line of the T running from the bottom to the middle, and the horizontal line at the top spanning left to right.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a T shape, but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 P 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical line of the T is shifted one column to the left compared to the original
- The horizontal line of the T remains at the same height but extends further to the left
- The path from P to G is still valid and follows the T shape
- The overall dimensions are maintained (7x7)
- The T shape is clearly recognizable in the empty spaces
