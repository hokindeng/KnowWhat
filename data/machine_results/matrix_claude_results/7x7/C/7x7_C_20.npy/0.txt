You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

P 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal 'G'.

Current observations:
1. The player 'P' is at position (0,0)
2. The goal 'G' is at position (4,3)
3. There appears to be a clear path down the left side and then right to reach the goal

For my next move, I want to move down to position (1,0), as this is clearly part of the path to reach the goal.

I choose coordinates: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue following the path down the left side of the maze.

From my current position at (1,0), I want to move down to position (2,0) to continue making progress toward the goal.

I choose coordinates: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving down along the left side of the maze.

From my current position at (2,0), I want to move down to position (3,0) to continue making progress toward the goal.

I choose coordinates: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue following the path, now moving down to the last position before turning right.

From my current position at (3,0), I want to move down to position (4,0) to reach the bottom row where I can then move right toward the goal.

I choose coordinates: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've reached the bottom row, I'll start moving right toward the goal.

From my current position at (4,0), I want to move right to position (4,1) to continue making progress toward the goal.

I choose coordinates: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving right toward the goal.

From my current position at (4,1), I want to move right to position (4,2) to get closer to the goal.

I choose coordinates: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now right next to the goal position.

From my current position at (4,2), I want to move right to position (4,3) to reach the goal 'G'.

I choose coordinates: (4,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) The empty spaces in the original maze form an "L" shape - starting from the top, going down along the left side, and then turning right at the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an "L" shape but with a slightly different arrangement:

P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Maintains the same 7x7 dimensions
- Has an "L" shaped corridor
- Provides a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original (the top row is mostly walls instead of empty spaces)
- The "L" shape is clearly recognizable in the pattern of empty spaces
