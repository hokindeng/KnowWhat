You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (5,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (1,0)
3. There appears to be a clear path up along the leftmost column

Since I need to reach the goal at (1,0) and I'm currently at (5,0), the optimal move would be to move up one space.

I choose to move to coordinates (4,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving up along the leftmost column towards the goal.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (1,0)
3. The path up along the leftmost column remains clear

Since I need to reach the goal at (1,0) and I'm currently at (4,0), I should continue moving up.

I choose to move to coordinates (3,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving up along the leftmost column towards the goal.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (3,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (1,0)
3. The path up along the leftmost column remains clear

Since I need to reach the goal at (1,0) and I'm currently at (3,0), I should continue moving up.

I choose to move to coordinates (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting very close to the goal now.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (1,0)
3. Just one more step up to reach the goal

Since I need to reach the goal at (1,0) and I'm currently at (2,0), I should make one final move up.

I choose to move to coordinates (1,0), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) In the original maze, the empty spaces form an "L" shape, with a vertical corridor along the left side and a horizontal corridor along the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an "L" shape but with a different arrangement:

1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions as the original
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms an "L" shape with its corridors (vertical portion down the middle, horizontal portion along the bottom)
- Is different from the original maze (the "L" is positioned differently)
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
