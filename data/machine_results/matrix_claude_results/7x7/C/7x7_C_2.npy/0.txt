You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (0,4)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (2,4)
3. Looking at the available paths:
   - I can move down through empty spaces to reach 'G'

For my next move, I want to move down from (0,4) to (1,4).

I choose coordinates: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (1,4) and need to move down one more space to reach the goal at (2,4).

I choose coordinates: (2,4)

This move will take me directly to the goal position 'G'.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "T" shape, with the vertical line running from the top and intersecting with a horizontal line at the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a "T" shape with its corridors, but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical line of the "T" runs down the middle
- The horizontal line of the "T" is at the top
- P and G are still connected by a valid path
- The overall "T" shape is maintained but positioned differently than in the original maze
