You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G 0 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,3)
2. Goal 'G' is at (2,4)
3. I need to find a path from P to G
4. Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach G, I need to:
   - Move up to the empty space
   - Then move right to reach G

For my next move, I want to move up to position (2,2).

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 G 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (2,2) and need to move right to reach the goal 'G' at (2,4).

I can see there's an empty space at (2,3) between my current position and the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P G 0 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2,3) and the goal 'G' is directly to my right at (2,4).

My next move coordinates are: (2,4)

This move will take me to the goal position and complete the maze!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a "T" shape, with the vertical line of the T running along the left side and the horizontal line crossing near the top.

Here's my new maze design with the same T-shape pattern:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 P 1 G 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1

This maze:
1. Maintains the same 7x7 dimensions
2. Forms a T-shape with its corridors
3. Has a valid path from P to G (up and right)
4. Is different from the original but preserves the T-shape pattern
5. Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
