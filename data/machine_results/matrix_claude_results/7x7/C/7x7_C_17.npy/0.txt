You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 P 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,4)
2. Goal 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I need to move down and left to reach the goal
4. Looking at available paths, I can see there's a path through the empty spaces ('0')

For my next move, I should move left to position (2,3), as this will get me closer to the goal while staying on valid empty spaces.

I choose to move to coordinates: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (2,3)
2. The goal 'G' is still at (4,2)
3. I need to continue moving left and then down to reach the goal
4. There is an empty path available through the '0' spaces

For my next move, I should move left again to position (2,2), continuing on the path toward the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (2,2)
2. The goal 'G' is at (4,2)
3. I can now move directly down to reach the goal
4. There is an empty path ('0') available downward

For my next move, I should move down to position (3,2), which will put me one step away from the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 P 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (3,2)
2. The goal 'G' is at (4,2), directly below me
3. I can move down one space to reach the goal

For my next move, I should move down to position (4,2), which will take me to the goal position.

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a general "L" shape (or an inverted "L" shape, depending on orientation).

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement while maintaining valid start and goal positions:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions (7x7)
- Contains an "L" shaped corridor
- Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original maze (P and some walls are in different positions)
- Maintains the general "L" shape of the corridor system

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
