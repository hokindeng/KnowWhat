You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,0)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (5,3)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces ('0') to reach the goal

Looking at the maze, I can see that there's a path of empty spaces leading up and then right towards the goal.

For my first move, I'll move up to coordinate (3,0), as this is part of the path of empty spaces that will eventually lead to the goal.

My next move coordinates: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (3,0)
2. The goal 'G' is still at (5,3)
3. I can see a clear path going up through the empty spaces and then right towards the goal

For my next move, I'll continue moving up to coordinate (2,0), following the path of empty spaces that will eventually allow me to move right towards the goal.

My next move coordinates: (2,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form an "L" shape, with one corridor going down the left side and another corridor along the bottom, meeting at a right angle.

Here's my new maze design with the same "L" shape pattern:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 G 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
1. The "L" shape is preserved
2. The vertical part of the "L" is along the left side
3. The horizontal part of the "L" is along the bottom
4. P and G are placed at different positions than in the original, but are still connected by the "L" shaped path
5. The maze has the same 7x7 dimensions as the original

The key difference from the original is that I've placed P near the top and G near the right side, but the fundamental "L" shape of the corridors remains the same.
