You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,0)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (5,3)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces ('0') to reach the goal

Looking at the maze, I can see that there's a path of empty spaces leading up and then right towards the goal.

For my first move, I'll move up to coordinate (3,0), as this is part of the path of empty spaces that will eventually lead to the goal.

My next move coordinates: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (3,0)
2. The goal 'G' is still at (5,3)
3. I can see a clear path going up to the empty spaces that will lead to the goal

For my next move, I'll move up again to coordinate (2,0), continuing along the path of empty spaces that will allow me to eventually reach the goal.

My next move coordinates: (2,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form:

1) A general "L" shape, with one corridor running vertically along the left side and another corridor running horizontally along the bottom, meeting at a right angle.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an "L" shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is not identical to the original maze
- Maintains the "L" shape pattern of empty spaces
- The vertical part of the L is along the left side
- The horizontal part of the L is along the bottom
- P and G are positioned so they can be reached through the L-shaped corridor
