You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,0)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (5,3)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces ('0') to reach the goal

Looking at the maze, I can see that there's a path of empty spaces leading up and then right towards the goal.

For my first move, I'll move up to coordinate (3,0), which is an empty space.

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (3,0)
2. The goal 'G' is still at (5,3)
3. I can see a clear path going up and then right towards the goal

For my next move, I'll move up again to coordinate (2,0), continuing along the path of empty spaces.

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (2,0)
2. The goal 'G' is at (5,3)
3. I can see I need to move right along the empty spaces in row 2 to make progress towards the goal

For my next move, I'll move right to coordinate (2,1), following the path of empty spaces.

My next move coordinates are: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (2,1)
2. The goal 'G' is at (5,3)
3. I need to continue moving right along the empty spaces in row 2

For my next move, I'll move right to coordinate (2,2), continuing along the path of empty spaces.

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (2,2)
2. The goal 'G' is at (5,3)
3. I need to continue moving right to reach the last empty space in row 2

For my next move, I'll move right to coordinate (2,3), reaching the last empty space in this row.

My next move coordinates are: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (2,3)
2. The goal 'G' is at (5,3)
3. I need to move down to reach the goal, which is directly below me

For my next move, I'll move down to coordinate (3,3), making my way towards the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (3,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

1) The empty spaces form an "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an "L" shape:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces still form an "L" shape
- There's a valid path from P to G
- The shape is rotated compared to the original
- The maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions
- The path follows the "L" shape corridor
