You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- Current position 'P' is at (2,1)
- Goal 'G' is at (0,4)
- I need to find a path through empty spaces ('0')

Looking at the available moves from my current position (2,1):
- Up: (1,1) is empty ('0')
- Down: (3,1) is empty ('0')
- Left: (2,0) is a wall ('1')
- Right: (2,2) is a wall ('1')

The goal is in the top row, so I should try to move upward when possible. Since (1,1) is an empty space, I'll move up.

My next move is to position (1,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves:
- Current position 'P' is at (1,1)
- Goal 'G' is at (0,4)
- Available moves:
  - Up: (0,1) is empty ('0')
  - Down: (2,1) is empty ('0')
  - Left: (1,0) is a wall ('1')
  - Right: (1,2) is a wall ('1')

Since the goal is in the top row and I can move up through an empty space, I'll continue moving upward.

My next move is to position (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 P 0 0 G 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves:
- Current position 'P' is at (0,1)
- Goal 'G' is at (0,4)
- Available moves:
  - Up: not possible (out of bounds)
  - Down: (1,1) is empty ('0')
  - Left: (0,0) is a wall ('1')
  - Right: (0,2) is empty ('0')

I'm now in the top row where the goal is. Since the goal is to the right at (0,4) and there's an empty path leading to it, I'll move right.

My next move is to position (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 P 0 G 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves:
- Current position 'P' is at (0,2)
- Goal 'G' is at (0,4)
- Available moves:
  - Up: not possible (out of bounds)
  - Down: (1,2) is a wall ('1')
  - Left: (0,1) is empty ('0')
  - Right: (0,3) is empty ('0')

I'm in the top row and can continue moving right toward the goal through empty spaces. The goal is two spaces to the right.

My next move is to position (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 0 P G 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves:
- Current position 'P' is at (0,3)
- Goal 'G' is at (0,4)
- Available moves:
  - Up: not possible (out of bounds)
  - Down: (1,3) is a wall ('1')
  - Left: (0,2) is empty ('0')
  - Right: (0,4) is the goal ('G')

I'm right next to the goal position! I can move right one space to reach it.

My next move is to position (0,4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form an "L" shape - there's a vertical corridor down the left side and a horizontal corridor across the top that connects to it.

Here's my new maze design with the same "L" shape pattern but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 1 1 G 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains an "L" shaped corridor
- Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original maze (the horizontal part of the L is in the second row instead of the first)
- Maintains the same basic "L" shape concept as the original

The path from P to G in this new maze requires moving down to access the vertical part of the L, then back up and right to reach the goal.
