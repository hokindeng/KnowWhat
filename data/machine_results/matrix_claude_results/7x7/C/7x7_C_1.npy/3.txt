You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 P 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,5)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (4,5)
3. Looking at the available paths:
   - There's a clear vertical path downward to reach 'G'
   - The position (3,5) is blocked by a wall
   - However, I can go around using the empty spaces ('0')

The best move would be to go right first, to position (2,6), and then I can move down through the empty spaces to eventually reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (2,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 G 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2,6), I need to move down to position (4,6) and then left to reach the goal.

Looking at the available moves:
1. Current position is (2,6)
2. I can move down to (3,6)
3. This will allow me to continue towards the goal

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,6)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a "U" shape, with the vertical parts of the U on the right side of the maze and the horizontal part connecting them at the bottom.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a U shape, but positioned differently:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 G 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The U shape is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise compared to the original
- The path still forms a valid U shape
- P and G are positioned at opposite ends of the U
- The maze has the same 7x7 dimensions
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The layout is different from the original while maintaining the U shape pattern
