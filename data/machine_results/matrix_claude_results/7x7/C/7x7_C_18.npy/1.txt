You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- Current position 'P' is at (1,0)
- Goal position 'G' is at (3,1)
- I need to reach the goal by moving through empty spaces (0s)

Looking at the available paths:
- I can move up to (0,0) since it's an empty space
- From there, I can move right through the empty spaces until I need to move down
- Eventually, I can reach the goal at (3,1)

For my next move, I will move UP from (1,0) to (0,0).

My next move coordinates are: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0,0), I can see that:
- I need to move right through the empty spaces to get closer to the goal
- After that, I'll need to move down to reach the goal at (3,1)

For my next move, I will move RIGHT from (0,0) to (0,1).

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1 1 1

0 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0,1), I can see that:
- I need to continue moving right through the empty spaces
- Then I'll need to move down to reach the goal at (3,1)

For my next move, I will move RIGHT from (0,1) to (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0,2), I can see that:
- I need to continue moving right through the last empty space
- Then I'll need to move down to reach the goal at (3,1)

For my next move, I will move RIGHT from (0,2) to (0,3).

My next move coordinates are: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0,3), I can see that:
- I need to start moving down through the empty spaces on the left side
- The goal is at (3,1), so I'll need to move down and then right to reach it

For my next move, I will move DOWN from (0,3) to (1,3).

However, I notice that position (1,3) is a wall (1). Let me correct my move.

I should move LEFT to (0,2) and then start moving down through the leftmost column of empty spaces.

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0,2), I can see that:
- I need to move left to access the leftmost column of empty spaces
- Then I can move down to reach the goal at (3,1)

For my next move, I will move LEFT from (0,2) to (0,1).

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0,1), I can see that:
- I need to move left one more time to access the leftmost column of empty spaces
- Then I can move down to reach the goal at (3,1)

For my next move, I will move LEFT from (0,1) to (0,0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can see that:

1) The empty spaces form an inverted "L" shape (or backwards "7" shape). The path requires going right along the top row, then down the leftmost column to reach the goal, forming this characteristic shape.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains the inverted "L" shape but with slight variations:

P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The inverted "L" shape is maintained but rotated 90 degrees clockwise
- The path goes right along the top row, then down the fifth column to reach G
- It's different from the original maze but maintains the same basic shape concept
- The path from P to G is valid and reachable through empty spaces
