You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- I'm currently at position P (0,1)
- The goal G is at position (1,3)
- I need to find a path avoiding walls (1's) and only moving through empty spaces (0's)

Looking at the available moves from my current position (0,1):
- Up: (0,0) - This is a valid move as it's an empty space (0)
- Down: (0,2) - This is a valid move as it's an empty space (0)
- Left/Right: Blocked by walls

Since I need to eventually reach G at (1,3), and I can see that I'll need to go down to reach it, I'll choose to move down to position (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: 0,2

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape - starting from the top, going down, and then turning right.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also has an "L" shaped corridor, but with a slightly different arrangement while maintaining a valid path from P to G:

P 0 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The L-shape is still present but rotated/flipped compared to the original
- There's a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- The maze maintains the same dimensions
- The general L-shape of the corridor is clearly recognizable
- The layout is different from the original maze while maintaining the same basic shape concept
