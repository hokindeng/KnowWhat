You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- Current position 'P' is at (1,0)
- Goal position 'G' is at (3,1)
- I need to reach the goal by moving through empty spaces (0s)

Looking at the available paths:
- I can move up to (0,0) since it's an empty space
- From there, I can move right through the empty spaces until I need to move down
- Eventually, I can reach the goal at (3,1)

For my next move, I will move up from (1,0) to (0,0).

My next move coordinates are: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0,0), I can see that:
- I need to move right through the empty spaces to get closer to the goal
- After that, I'll need to move down to reach the goal at (3,1)

I will move right to position (0,1).

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0,1), I can continue moving right to get closer to the goal position. After that, I'll need to move down to reach the goal.

I will move right to position (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0,2), I can continue moving right one more time before I need to start moving down towards the goal.

I will move right to position (0,3).

My next move coordinates are: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 1 1 1

0 G 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0,3), I need to start moving down to reach the goal. Looking at the available paths:
- I can't go right (wall)
- I need to go down through the empty spaces on the left side
- This will lead me to the goal at (3,1)

I will move down to position (1,3).

However, I notice that position (1,3) is a wall (1). Let me correct my strategy:
I need to move left first, then down along the leftmost column to reach the goal.

I will move left to position (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form:

1) An "L" shape - there's a horizontal corridor along the top and a vertical corridor on the left side that meet to form an L.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an L-shape but with a different arrangement:

P 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The horizontal part of the L is at the top row
- The vertical part of the L is in the fifth column
- The path from P to G follows the L shape
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
- The L shape is clearly recognizable but different from the original maze's L
