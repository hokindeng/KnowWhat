You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The player (P) is at position (1,4)
- The goal (G) is at position (4,4)
- There is a clear path downward through empty spaces

Since I need to reach the goal which is directly below the player position, and there are empty spaces connecting them, I'll move down one step.

My next move coordinates are: (2,4)

This will move the player one step down towards the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving down towards the goal since there's a clear path.

The player (P) is currently at (2,4), and the goal (G) is at (4,4). There's an empty space directly below the player.

My next move coordinates are: (3,4)

This will move the player one step down, getting closer to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now just one step away from the goal. The player (P) is at (3,4) and the goal (G) is directly below at (4,4).

My next move coordinates are: (4,4)

This final move will take the player to the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) In the original maze, the empty spaces form an "L" shape, with a vertical corridor that connects to a horizontal segment at the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also features an "L" shaped path, but with the L oriented differently:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the L is longer
- The horizontal part is at the bottom
- The path from P to G is still valid and follows the L shape
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
- The L shape is clearly recognizable in the pattern of empty spaces
