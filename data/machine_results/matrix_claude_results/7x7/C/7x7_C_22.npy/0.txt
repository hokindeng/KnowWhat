You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current player position (P) is at (1,4)
2. Goal position (G) is at (4,4)
3. Looking at the available paths:
   - I can move down through the empty spaces (0)
   - The goal is directly below the current position

Since the goal is directly below my current position and there's a clear path downward, I should move down.

My next move coordinates are: (2,4)

This will move the player (P) one step down towards the goal (G).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current player position (P) is at (2,4)
2. Goal position (G) is at (4,4)
3. Looking at the available paths:
   - I can move down through the empty space (0)
   - The goal is still directly below my current position

The best move is to continue moving down towards the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (3,4)

This will move the player (P) one step down, getting closer to the goal (G).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current player position (P) is at (3,4)
2. Goal position (G) is at (4,4)
3. Looking at the available paths:
   - I can move down through to the goal position
   - The goal is directly below me, just one step away

The final move should be down to reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (4,4)

This will move the player (P) to the goal position (G), completing the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form an inverted "T" shape. The vertical line of the T runs from top to bottom in column 4, and the horizontal line spans across the top row from columns 4 to 6.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an inverted "T" shape, but with the horizontal part at the bottom instead of the top:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions as the original (7x7)
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms an inverted T shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze (the horizontal part is at the bottom)
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
