You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,0)
2. Goal 'G' is at (6,3)
3. I can see there's a path going up through the empty spaces (0s) and then right to reach the goal

For my next move, I should move up to coordinate (2,0), as this is part of the clear path that will eventually lead to the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (2,0)
2. The goal 'G' is still at (6,3)
3. I can see I need to move right along the empty spaces in row 2 to make progress toward the goal

For my next move, I should move right to coordinate (2,1).

My next move coordinates are: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 G 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (2,1)
2. The goal 'G' is still at (6,3)
3. I should continue moving right along the empty spaces in row 2 to make progress toward the goal

For my next move, I should move right to coordinate (2,2).

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (2,2)
2. The goal 'G' is still at (6,3)
3. I should continue moving right along the empty spaces in row 2 to reach the last available space before the wall

For my next move, I should move right to coordinate (2,3).

My next move coordinates are: (2,3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

1. I am now at position (2,3)
2. The goal 'G' is at (6,3)
3. I can see that I need to move down to reach the goal, as there's a wall to my right and I need to get to the bottom row

For my next move, I should move down to coordinate (3,3).

My next move coordinates are: (3,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

1. The empty spaces form an "L" shape - there's a vertical corridor on the left side and a horizontal corridor at the bottom that meets it, forming a 90-degree angle.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an "L" shape, but with the corridors in different positions:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the "L" runs down the fifth column
- The horizontal part is at the top in the second row
- The path from P to G is clear and follows the L-shape
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
- The L-shape is clearly recognizable but positioned differently from the original
