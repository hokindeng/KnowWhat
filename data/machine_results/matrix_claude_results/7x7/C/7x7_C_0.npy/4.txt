You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The player (P) is at position (2,1)
- The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
- I need to find a path from P to G through empty spaces (0)

Looking at the maze, I can see that there's a clear path going down through the empty spaces on the left side of the maze, and then right towards the goal.

For my first move, I want to move down to coordinate (2,2). This is a valid move because:
1. It's adjacent to the current position
2. It's an empty space (0)
3. It moves me closer to the goal

So, my next move coordinates are: (2,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape - going down vertically and then turning right horizontally.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also has an "L" shaped corridor, but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is still present but shifted to the right
- There's still a valid path from P to G
- The maze maintains the same dimensions
- The empty spaces form a recognizable "L" shape
- The layout is different from the original while maintaining the same general shape pattern

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
