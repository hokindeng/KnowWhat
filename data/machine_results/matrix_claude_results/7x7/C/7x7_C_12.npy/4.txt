You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- The player 'P' is at position (4,1)
- The goal 'G' is at position (5,4)
- I need to find a path through the empty spaces ('0')

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach the goal:
1. I need to move up through the empty spaces
2. Then move right along the empty corridor
3. Finally move down to reach the goal

For my first move, I should move UP from (4,1) to (3,1), as this is the only valid move that will help me progress toward the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (3,1)
- The goal 'G' is still at position (5,4)
- I need to continue finding a path through the empty spaces ('0')

From my current position, I can see that I need to:
1. Move up to the corridor of empty spaces
2. Then move right along this corridor
3. Finally move down to reach the goal

Therefore, I should move UP from (3,1) to (2,1) to reach the horizontal corridor.

My next move coordinates are: (2,1)

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (2,1)
- The goal 'G' is still at position (5,4)
- I can see a clear path through the empty spaces ('0')

From my current position, I should:
1. Move right along the horizontal corridor of empty spaces
2. This will get me closer to being above the goal position
3. Later I'll need to move down to reach the goal

Therefore, I should move RIGHT from (2,1) to (2,2).

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (2,2)
- The goal 'G' is still at position (5,4)
- I need to continue moving along the empty corridor

From my current position, I should:
1. Continue moving right along the horizontal corridor
2. This will get me closer to being above the goal position
3. Later I'll need to move down to reach the goal

Therefore, I should move RIGHT from (2,2) to (2,3).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (2,3)
- The goal 'G' is still at position (5,4)
- I need to continue moving along the empty corridor

From my current position, I should:
1. Move right one more time to reach the position above the path to the goal
2. This will be my last horizontal move before I need to find a way down

Therefore, I should move RIGHT from (2,3) to (2,4).

My next move coordinates are: (2,4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (2,4)
- The goal 'G' is at position (5,4)
- I need to find a way down to the goal

From my current position, I can see that:
1. I can't move directly down as there are walls
2. I need to go back to the left side and use the path there
3. Then I can move down and right to reach the goal

Therefore, I should move LEFT from (2,4) to (2,3) to start making my way to the available downward path.

My next move coordinates are: (2,3)

From my current position, I should:
1. Continue moving left to reach the leftmost column of empty spaces
2. This will allow me to move down and then right to the goal

Therefore, I should move LEFT from (2,3) to (2,2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape. The vertical part of the L is on the left side, and the horizontal parts are at the top and bottom of the maze.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an L-shape pattern with its corridors, but with a slightly different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 G 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The L-shape is rotated 90 degrees compared to the original
- The vertical part of the L is on the right side
- The horizontal parts are at the top and bottom
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The outer walls are preserved
- The maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions as the original
