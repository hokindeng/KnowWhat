You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,1)
2. Goal 'G' is at (5,4)
3. Available moves from current position:
   - Up to (3,1)
   - Down to (5,1)

Looking at the overall maze structure, I can see that we need to:
1. Move down to access the bottom path
2. Then move right along the bottom path to reach the goal

Therefore, I choose to move down to coordinate (5,1).

My next move: (5,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5,1), I can see that I need to move right along the bottom path to reach the goal at (5,4).

I can move right to (5,2), which will bring me one step closer to the goal.

My next move: (5,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5,2), I can continue moving right along the bottom path towards the goal at (5,4).

I'll move right to (5,3).

My next move: (5,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5,3), I can see the goal 'G' directly to my right at (5,4).

I'll make my final move right to reach the goal.

My next move: (5,4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form an "L" shape, with a vertical corridor on the left side and a horizontal corridor along the bottom.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an "L" shape but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions as the original
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms an "L" shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze (P and G are in new positions)
- Maintains the same encoding system (1=wall, 0=empty space, P=player, G=goal)
