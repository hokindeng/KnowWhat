You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (1,4)
2. Goal 'G' is at (4,5)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces ('0')
4. Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to:
   - Move up to access the path that leads to the goal
   - Then move right through the empty spaces to reach 'G'

For my next move, I should move UP from (1,4) to (1,3), as this is the only viable path that will eventually lead to the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (1,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape (or inverted "L" shape, depending on orientation).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an "L" shape but with a different arrangement while maintaining a valid path from P to G:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is rotated 90 degrees compared to the original
- There's still a valid path from P to G
- The maze maintains the same dimensions
- The empty spaces clearly form an "L" shape
- The walls (1's) still form a valid boundary around the path
