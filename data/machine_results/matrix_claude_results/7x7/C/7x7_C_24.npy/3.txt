You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 G 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal 'G'.

Current observations:
- Player 'P' is at position (5,3)
- Goal 'G' is at position (1,1)
- There's a clear path going up through the empty spaces ('0')

To reach the goal, I need to move up through the empty corridor on the left side of the maze.

For my next move, I'll move up one position.

My next move coordinates are: (4,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape. The vertical part of the L runs along the left side of the maze, and the horizontal part runs along the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also contains an L-shaped corridor, but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1 G 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The L-shape is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise compared to the original
- The horizontal part of the L is now at the top of the maze
- The vertical part is still on the left side
- P and G are positioned at opposite ends of the L-shaped corridor
- The path from P to G is still valid and follows the L-shape

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
