You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 P 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

Current observations:
- Player (P) is at position (5,5)
- Goal (G) is at position (4,0)
- There's a clear path along the left side and bottom of the maze

To reach the goal, I need to move left along the bottom row and then up along the leftmost column.

For my next move, I'll move left from position (5,5) to (5,4).

My next move coordinates are: (5,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape - with one vertical corridor along the left side and one horizontal corridor along the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an "L" shape but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 0 1 1
G 0 0 0 0 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions as the original
- Forms an "L" shape with its corridors
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze
- Places the vertical corridor on the fifth column instead of the first
- Places P at the top and G at the bottom left
- Maintains the "L" shape pattern while being a distinct configuration
