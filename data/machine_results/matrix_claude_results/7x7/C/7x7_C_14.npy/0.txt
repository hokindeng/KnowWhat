You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 P 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- Current position 'P' is at (0,1)
- Goal position 'G' is at (3,3)
- I need to reach the goal by moving through empty spaces ('0')
- I can see there's a path going down the left side and then right to the goal

Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to move down first to eventually reach the goal.
The available move is to position (1,0), which is the empty space below and to the left of my current position.

I choose to move to coordinates: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (1,0)
- The goal 'G' is still at (3,3)
- I need to continue moving down through the empty spaces on the left side of the maze

The best move is to continue downward to position (2,0), which is the empty space directly below my current position.

I choose to move to coordinates: (2,0)

- I am now at position (2,0)
- The goal 'G' is still at (3,3)
- I need to continue moving down through the empty spaces on the left side of the maze

The best move is to continue downward to position (3,0), which is the empty space directly below my current position.

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (3,0)
- The goal 'G' is at (3,3)
- I need to continue moving down to reach the bottom row where I can then move right towards the goal

The best move is to continue downward to position (4,0), which is the empty space directly below my current position.

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (4,0)
- The goal 'G' is at (4,3)
- I'm on the same row as the goal, so I need to move right to reach it

The best move is to move right to position (4,1), which is the empty space directly to my right.

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,1)

- I am now at position (4,1)
- The goal 'G' is at (4,3)
- I need to continue moving right to reach the goal

The best move is to continue right to position (4,2), which is the empty space directly to my right.

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (4,2)
- The goal 'G' is at (4,3)
- I'm just one step away from the goal

The final move is to move right to position (4,3), which will take me to the goal position.

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape - starting from the top, going down along the left side, and then making a right turn at the bottom to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an "L" shape but with a slightly different arrangement:

P 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions (7x7)
- Maintains an "L" shape pattern for the empty spaces
- Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original maze but preserves the "L" shape concept
- Places P at the top and G at the end of the horizontal part of the "L"
