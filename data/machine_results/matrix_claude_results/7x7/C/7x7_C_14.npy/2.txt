You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 P 0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:
- Current position 'P' is at (0,1)
- Goal position 'G' is at (3,3)
- I need to reach the goal by moving through empty spaces ('0')
- I can see there's a path going down the left side and then right to the goal

Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to:
1. Move down through the empty spaces on the left side
2. Then move right to reach the goal

For my next move, I should move down from (0,1) to (1,0).

My next move coordinates are: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Following the path down the left side of the maze, I should continue moving down from my current position at (1,0) to (2,0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1 1 1

0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing down the left side of the maze, I should move from my current position at (2,0) to (3,0).

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1 1 1

0 0 0 G 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing my path, I should now move down from my current position at (3,0) to (4,0).

My next move coordinates are: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I've reached the bottom of the vertical path, I need to move right towards the goal. From my current position at (4,0), I should move to (4,1).

My next move coordinates are: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing to move right towards the goal, from my current position at (4,1), I should move to (4,2).

My next move coordinates are: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now one step away from the goal. From my current position at (4,2), I should move right to reach the goal at (4,3).

My next move coordinates are: (4,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape - with a vertical corridor down the left side and a horizontal corridor at the bottom that leads to the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an "L" shape but is not identical to the original:

P 0 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 G 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions (7x7)
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms an "L" shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original (the horizontal part of the L is longer)
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for start, G for goal)
