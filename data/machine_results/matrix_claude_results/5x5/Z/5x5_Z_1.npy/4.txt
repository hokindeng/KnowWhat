You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position (P) is at (1,3)
Goal position (G) is at (1,0)

Since we can move in any direction including diagonals, and we need to reach the goal which is to the left, the most efficient path would be to move diagonally up-left or straight left through the empty spaces.

Looking at the available moves:
- Left: (1,2) is empty
- Diagonal up-left: (0,2) is a wall
- Diagonal down-left: (2,2) is empty

The most direct path to the goal would be to move left first, staying on row 1.

I choose to move to position (1,2), which means moving left one space.

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

Current position (P) is at (1,2)
Goal position (G) is at (1,0)

We need to continue moving towards the goal which is two spaces to the left. The path is clear with empty spaces leading to the goal.

Looking at the available moves:
- Left: (1,1) is empty and would get us closer to the goal
- Diagonal up-left: (0,1) is a wall
- Diagonal down-left: (2,1) is a wall

The best move is to continue moving left through the empty space.

I choose to move to position (1,1).

My next move coordinates are: (1,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

Current position (P) is at (1,1)
Goal position (G) is at (1,0)

We're now right next to the goal position, which is one space to the left.

Looking at the available moves:
- Left: (1,0) is the goal position 'G'

This is a straightforward choice - we can reach the goal in one move by moving left.

I choose to move to position (1,0).

My next move coordinates are: (1,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

1) The empty spaces in this maze form an "L" shape. The main corridor runs horizontally along row 1, then turns downward in the last row to form the vertical part of the L.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming an L shape, but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 G
1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 0 0 1 1

In this new maze:
- The L shape is rotated 90 degrees compared to the original
- P and G are placed at different positions but are still connected by the L-shaped corridor
- The maze maintains the same 5x5 dimensions
- The empty spaces clearly form an L shape
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The maze is distinct from the original while maintaining the L shape pattern
