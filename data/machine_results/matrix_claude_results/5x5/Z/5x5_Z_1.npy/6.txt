You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position (P) is at (1,3)
Goal position (G) is at (1,0)

Since we can move in any direction including diagonals, and we need to reach the goal which is to the left, the most efficient path would be to move diagonally up-left or straight left through the empty spaces.

Looking at the maze:
- Moving straight left is possible through the empty spaces
- Moving diagonally up-left would hit a wall

Therefore, I choose to move left to coordinate (1,2).

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

Current position (P) is at (1,2)
Goal position (G) is at (1,0)

We need to continue moving left to reach the goal. There is a clear path of empty spaces leading to the goal position.

I choose to move left to coordinate (1,1).

My next move coordinates are: (1,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:

Current position (P) is at (1,1)
Goal position (G) is at (1,0)

We are now right next to the goal position, with just one more move needed to reach it.

I choose to move left to coordinate (1,0) to reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (1,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

1) The empty spaces form an "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation). The main corridor runs horizontally along row 1, then turns and continues vertically down the rightmost portion of the maze.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming an "L" shape:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions (5x5)
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original maze
- Maintains an "L" shape pattern in its empty spaces
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
