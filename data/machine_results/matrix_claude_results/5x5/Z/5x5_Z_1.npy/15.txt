You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position (P) is at (1,3)
Goal position (G) is at (1,0)

Since we can move in any direction including diagonals, and we need to reach the goal which is to the left, the most efficient path would be to move diagonally up-left or straight left through the empty spaces.

Looking at the available moves:
- Left: (1,2) is empty
- Diagonal up-left: (0,2) is a wall
- Diagonal down-left: (2,2) is empty

The most direct path to the goal would be to move left first, so I choose coordinates (1,2).

My next move is to position (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 P 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current position (P) is at (1,2)
Goal position (G) is at (1,0)

Looking at the available moves:
- Left: (1,1) is empty
- Diagonal up-left: (0,1) is a wall
- Diagonal down-left: (2,1) is a wall

The most direct path to the goal would be to continue moving left through the empty space at (1,1), which will bring us one step closer to the goal.

My next move is to position (1,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
G P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current position (P) is at (1,1)
Goal position (G) is at (1,0)

Looking at the available moves:
- Left: (1,0) is the goal position 'G'

We are right next to the goal, so the obvious choice is to move left to reach it.

My next move is to position (1,0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 P 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

1) The empty spaces in this maze form a general "L" shape. The main corridor runs horizontally along row 1, then turns downward in the last column to form the vertical part of the L.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an L shape, but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1
G 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1

In this new maze:
- The L shape is more pronounced
- P and G are still connected by a valid path
- The empty spaces form an L with a horizontal corridor at the top and a vertical corridor on the right
- The maze has the same dimensions (5x5)
- It's clearly different from the original maze while maintaining the L-shaped pattern
