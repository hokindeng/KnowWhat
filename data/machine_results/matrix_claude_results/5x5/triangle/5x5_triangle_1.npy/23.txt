You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the optimal path from P to G.

Current position (P) is at (2,4)
Goal position (G) is at (2,0)

Since we can move in any direction including diagonals, and we need to reach the leftmost side of the maze, I'll plan to move diagonally left and up when possible.

Looking at the maze, I can see that there's a clear path of empty spaces (0s) from P to G.

For my first move, I'll move diagonally left and up to coordinate (1,3), which is an empty space (0).

My next move coordinates are: (1,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 P 1
G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (1,3) and need to reach G at (2,0).

Looking at the available paths, I can see that I can continue moving towards G through the empty spaces. Since we can move diagonally, I'll move diagonally left and down to coordinate (2,2), which is an empty space (0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2,2) and need to reach G at (2,0).

Looking at the available paths, I can move directly left through the empty spaces. I'll move to coordinate (2,1), which is an empty space (0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2,1) and need to reach G at (2,0).

I'm right next to the goal now. I'll make my final move directly left to reach G at coordinate (2,0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

1) The empty spaces form a "Z" shape (or reversed "Z" depending on orientation).

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with a Z-shaped corridor:
1 1 P 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 0 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Maintains the same 5x5 dimensions
- Has a clear Z-shaped path of empty spaces
- Places P and G at opposite ends of the Z
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general Z shape pattern
- Allows valid movement from P to G through the empty spaces
