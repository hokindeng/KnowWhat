You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

Current position (P) is at (2,4)
Goal position (G) is at (2,0)

Since we can move in any direction including diagonals, and we need to reach the leftmost side of the maze, I'll move diagonally to the left and up to make progress towards the goal while avoiding walls.

I choose to move to coordinates (1,3), which is diagonally up and left from the current position. This is an empty space (0) and will get us closer to the goal.

My next move: (1,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 P 1
G 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (1,3), and I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2,0).

Looking at the available paths, I can see that I can move diagonally down and left to position (2,2), which is an empty space and will get me closer to the goal while maintaining a clear path.

My next move: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (2,2), and I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2,0).

From my current position, I can move directly left to position (2,1), which is an empty space and will get me one step closer to the goal.

My next move: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
G P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (2,1), and I'm right next to the goal at (2,0).

I can simply move one step left to reach the goal position.

My next move: (2,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a "Z" shape, with the horizontal lines of the Z being slightly slanted.

Here's my new maze design that maintains a Z-shaped corridor but with a different arrangement:

1 1 P 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 G 1 1 1

This maze:
1. Is 5x5 like the original
2. Has a clear path from P to G through empty spaces
3. Is different from the original maze
4. Maintains a Z-shaped corridor pattern, though oriented slightly differently from the original
5. Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)

The path follows the Z shape from top to bottom, with the player starting at the top and the goal at the bottom, connected by diagonal and horizontal empty spaces.
