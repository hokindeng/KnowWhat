You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (2,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Since we can move in any direction (including diagonals) and need to reach the goal on the left side, I'll choose to move diagonally up-left to position (1,1).

However, I notice that position (1,1) is a wall (marked as '1'). Let me check other possible moves:
- Up: (1,2) is a wall
- Down: (3,2) is a wall
- Left: (2,1) is a wall
- Right: (2,3) is a wall
- Up-right: (1,3) is empty
- Down-right: (3,3) is a wall
- Up-left: (1,1) is a wall
- Down-left: (3,1) is empty

Looking at the overall maze, to reach 'G', we need to go through the empty spaces. The best move would be to position (1,3) (up-right), which will allow us to eventually reach the goal through the top row.

I choose to move to coordinates (1,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 P 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (1,3), and I need to reach 'G' at (2,0).

Looking at the available moves from my current position (1,3):
- Up: (0,3) is empty
- Down: (2,3) is a wall
- Left: (1,2) is a wall
- Right: (1,4) is a wall
- Up-right: (0,4) is empty
- Down-right: blocked by wall
- Up-left: (0,2) is empty
- Down-left: blocked by wall

The best move would be to go up to (0,3), as this will allow me to traverse along the top row (which is all empty spaces) to eventually reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,3), and I need to reach 'G' at (2,0).

Looking at my current position (0,3), I can see that the entire top row is empty spaces, which gives me a clear path to the left side of the maze where the goal is located.

The best move would be to move left to (0,2), continuing along the top row towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,2), and I need to reach 'G' at (2,0).

Continuing along the top row towards the goal, I'll move left to (0,1).

I choose to move to coordinates (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,1), and I need to reach 'G' at (2,0).

I'm getting very close to the goal. I'll move left one more time to (0,0), which will put me directly above the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,0), and I need to reach 'G' at (2,0).

I'm directly above the goal, and since diagonal moves are allowed, I can move directly to the goal position with a diagonal down move.

I choose to move to coordinates (2,0), which is the goal position 'G'.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

(1) The empty spaces form an inverted "L" shape (or backwards "7" shape). The main corridor runs along the top row and then drops down on the left side.

(2) Here's a new maze with the same inverted "L" shape pattern but with a different wall arrangement:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 0
G 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

In this new maze:
- The top row and left column are still primarily empty spaces forming the inverted "L"
- The walls are arranged differently but still maintain the basic shape
- There's a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The maze has the same 5x5 dimensions
- It's not identical to the original maze but maintains the same general corridor shape
