You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (2,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Since we can move in any direction (including diagonals) and need to reach the goal on the left side, I'll choose to move diagonally up-left to position (1,1).

However, I notice that position (1,1) is a wall (marked as '1'). Let me check other possible moves:
- Up: (1,2) is a wall
- Down: (3,2) is a wall
- Left: (2,1) is a wall
- Right: (2,3) is a wall
- Up-right: (1,3) is empty
- Down-right: (3,3) is a wall
- Down-left: (3,1) is empty
- Up-left: (1,1) is a wall

I can see that to reach the goal at (2,0), we'll need to go through the empty spaces. The best first move would be to position (1,3), which is up-right from the current position.

My next move coordinates are: (1,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 P 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (1,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Looking at the possible moves from (1,3):
- Up: (0,3) is empty
- Down: (2,3) is a wall
- Left: (1,2) is a wall
- Right: (1,4) is a wall
- Up-right: (0,4) is empty
- Down-right: blocked by wall
- Down-left: blocked by wall
- Up-left: (0,2) is empty

To reach the goal at (2,0), we need to move towards the left side of the maze. The best path would be to move up and then left through the empty spaces in the top row.

I choose to move up to position (0,3).

My next move coordinates are: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (0,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Looking at the possible moves from (0,3):
- Up: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1,3) is empty
- Left: (0,2) is empty
- Right: (0,4) is empty
- Up-right: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down-right: (1,4) is a wall
- Down-left: (1,2) is a wall
- Up-left: not possible (out of bounds)

Since we need to reach the goal at (2,0), we should move left through the empty spaces in the top row. This will give us the clearest path to eventually reach the goal.

I choose to move left to position (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (0,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Looking at the possible moves from (0,2):
- Up: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1,2) is a wall
- Left: (0,1) is empty
- Right: (0,3) is empty
- Up-right: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down-right: (1,3) is empty
- Down-left: (1,1) is a wall
- Up-left: not possible (out of bounds)

To reach the goal at (2,0), we should continue moving left through the empty spaces in the top row. This will allow us to eventually move down to reach the goal.

I choose to move left to position (0,1).

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (0,1)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Looking at the possible moves from (0,1):
- Up: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1,1) is a wall
- Left: (0,0) is empty
- Right: (0,2) is empty
- Up-right: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down-right: (1,2) is a wall
- Down-left: (1,0) is empty
- Up-left: not possible (out of bounds)

Since the goal is at (2,0), we should move to (0,0) and then we can move down through the empty spaces on the left side to reach the goal.

I choose to move left to position (0,0).

My next move coordinates are: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (0,0)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Looking at the possible moves from (0,0):
- Up: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1,0) is empty
- Left: not possible (out of bounds)
- Right: (0,1) is empty
- Up-right: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down-right: (1,1) is a wall
- Down-left: not possible (out of bounds)
- Up-left: not possible (out of bounds)

The goal is directly below us, two spaces down. We can move down through the empty spaces to reach it.

I choose to move down to position (1,0).

My next move coordinates are: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (1,0)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Looking at the possible moves from (1,0):
- Up: (0,0) is empty
- Down: (2,0) is the goal 'G'
- Left: not possible (out of bounds)
- Right: (1,1) is a wall
- Up-right: (0,1) is empty
- Down-right: (2,1) is a wall
- Down-left: not possible (out of bounds)
- Up-left: not possible (out of bounds)

We're right next to the goal! We can move directly down to reach it.

I choose to move down to position (2,0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

1) The empty spaces form a general "L" shape, with one corridor along the top row and another corridor down the left side.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze that maintains an "L" shape pattern of empty spaces but with a different wall configuration:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions
- Contains an "L" shaped corridor
- Places P and G in positions that can be reached through the empty spaces
- Has a different wall configuration than the original
- Maintains the recognizable "L" shape of the corridors

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
