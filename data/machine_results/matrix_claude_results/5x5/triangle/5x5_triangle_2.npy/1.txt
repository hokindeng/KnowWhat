You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (2,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Since we can move in any direction (including diagonals) and need to reach the goal on the left side, I'll choose to move diagonally up-left to position (1,1).

However, I notice that position (1,1) is a wall (marked as '1'). Let me check other possible moves:
- Up: (1,2) is a wall
- Down: (3,2) is a wall
- Left: (2,1) is a wall
- Right: (2,3) is a wall
- Up-right: (1,3) is empty
- Down-right: (3,3) is a wall
- Up-left: (1,1) is a wall
- Down-left: (3,1) is empty

Looking at the overall maze, to reach 'G', we need to go through the empty spaces. The best move would be to position (1,3) (up-right), which will allow us to eventually reach the goal through the top row.

I choose to move to coordinates (1,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 P 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (1,3), and I need to reach 'G' at (2,0).

Looking at the available moves from my current position (1,3):
- Up: (0,3) is empty
- Down: (2,3) is a wall
- Left: (1,2) is a wall
- Right: (1,4) is a wall
- Up-right: (0,4) is empty
- Down-right: blocked by wall
- Up-left: (0,2) is empty
- Down-left: blocked by wall

The best move is to go up to (0,3), as this will allow me to traverse along the top row (which is all empty spaces) and then move down to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,3), and I need to reach 'G' at (2,0).

Looking at the available moves from my current position (0,3):
- Up: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1,3) is empty
- Left: (0,2) is empty
- Right: (0,4) is empty
- Up-right: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down-right: blocked by wall
- Up-left: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down-left: blocked by wall

Since I need to reach 'G' which is on the left side, I should move left along the top row. This will give me a clear path to eventually reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,2), and I need to reach 'G' at (2,0).

Looking at the available moves from my current position (0,2):
- Up: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1,2) is a wall
- Left: (0,1) is empty
- Right: (0,3) is empty
- Up-right: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down-right: blocked by wall
- Up-left: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down-left: blocked by wall

Continuing to move left along the top row will bring me closer to the goal position. Once I reach (0,0), I can move down diagonally to reach 'G'.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,1), and I need to reach 'G' at (2,0).

Looking at the available moves from my current position (0,1):
- Up: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1,1) is a wall
- Left: (0,0) is empty
- Right: (0,2) is empty
- Up-right: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down-right: blocked by wall
- Up-left: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down-left: blocked by wall

I'll continue moving left to (0,0), which will put me in position to move diagonally down-right to reach the goal 'G'.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,0), and I need to reach 'G' at (2,0).

Looking at the available moves from my current position (0,0):
- Up: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1,0) is empty
- Left: not possible (out of bounds)
- Right: (0,1) is empty
- Up-right: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down-right: blocked by wall
- Up-left: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down-left: not possible (out of bounds)

From here, I can move down to (1,0), which will put me right above the goal position. Then in the next move, I can reach 'G'.

I choose to move to coordinates (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (1,0), and I need to reach 'G' at (2,0).

Looking at the available moves from my current position (1,0):
- Up: (0,0) is empty
- Down: (2,0) is the goal 'G'
- Left: not possible (out of bounds)
- Right: blocked by wall
- Up-right: blocked by wall
- Down-right: blocked by wall
- Up-left: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down-left: not possible (out of bounds)

I can now move directly down to reach the goal position.

I choose to move to coordinates (2,0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

(1) The empty spaces form an "L" shape, with one corridor along the top row and another corridor down the left side.

(2) Here's a new maze with the same "L" shape pattern but with some variations:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 0
G 0 1 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is preserved
- P and G are placed at opposite ends of the "L"
- The path is still valid (can move from P to G through empty spaces)
- The walls are arranged differently while maintaining the basic "L" structure
- The size is the same (5x5)
