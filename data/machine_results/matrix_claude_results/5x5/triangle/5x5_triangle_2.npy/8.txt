You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (2,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Since we can move in any direction (including diagonals) and need to reach the goal on the left side, I'll choose to move diagonally up-left to position (1,1).

However, I notice that position (1,1) is a wall (marked as '1'). Let me check other possible moves:
- Up: (1,2) is a wall
- Down: (3,2) is a wall
- Left: (2,1) is a wall
- Right: (2,3) is a wall
- Up-right: (1,3) is empty
- Down-right: (3,3) is a wall
- Down-left: (3,1) is empty
- Up-left: (1,1) is a wall

I can see that the best path to reach 'G' would be to go through the empty spaces. Looking at the available moves, I'll choose to move up-right to coordinates (1,3), as this will allow me to eventually circle around to reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (1,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 P 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (1,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Looking at the possible moves from (1,3):
- Up: (0,3) is empty
- Down: (2,3) is a wall
- Left: (1,2) is a wall
- Right: (1,4) is a wall
- Up-right: (0,4) is empty
- Down-right: not possible (wall)
- Down-left: (2,2) is empty
- Up-left: (0,2) is empty

The goal is to the left and down from our current position. We need to find a path around the walls to reach it. Looking at the available spaces, moving up to (0,3) would give us more flexibility to move left in subsequent moves, eventually allowing us to reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (0,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Looking at the possible moves from (0,3):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,3) is empty
- Left: (0,2) is empty
- Right: (0,4) is empty
- Up-right: not possible (outside maze)
- Down-right: (1,4) is a wall
- Down-left: (1,2) is a wall
- Up-left: not possible (outside maze)

Since our goal is to reach G at (2,0), we need to move left to eventually get there. Moving left to (0,2) is the best option as it brings us closer to our goal while maintaining a clear path.

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (0,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Looking at the possible moves from (0,2):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,2) is a wall
- Left: (0,1) is empty
- Right: (0,3) is empty
- Up-right: not possible (outside maze)
- Down-right: (1,3) is empty
- Down-left: (1,1) is a wall
- Up-left: not possible (outside maze)

Since our goal is to reach G at (2,0), we should continue moving left. Moving to (0,1) is the best option as it brings us closer to our goal and maintains a path to reach it.

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (0,1)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Looking at the possible moves from (0,1):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,1) is a wall
- Left: (0,0) is empty
- Right: (0,2) is empty
- Up-right: not possible (outside maze)
- Down-right: (1,2) is a wall
- Down-left: (1,0) is empty
- Up-left: not possible (outside maze)

Since our goal is to reach G at (2,0), we should move to (0,0) which will then allow us to move down to eventually reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (0,0)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Looking at the possible moves from (0,0):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,0) is empty
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (0,1) is empty
- Up-right: not possible (outside maze)
- Down-right: (1,1) is a wall
- Down-left: not possible (outside maze)
- Up-left: not possible (outside maze)

Since our goal G is directly below us at (2,0), we should move down to (1,0) which will put us right above the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (1,0)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Looking at the possible moves from (1,0):
- Up: (0,0) is empty
- Down: (2,0) is the goal 'G'
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (1,1) is a wall
- Up-right: (0,1) is empty
- Down-right: (2,1) is a wall
- Down-left: not possible (outside maze)
- Up-left: not possible (outside maze)

We're right above the goal! We can simply move down one space to reach it.

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

1) The empty spaces form a general "U" shape, with the open end at the top of the maze and the bottom of the U on the left side.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with a similar U-shaped corridor pattern, but with a different arrangement:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 G 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 0

This new maze:
- Maintains the 5x5 dimensions
- Has a U-shaped corridor pattern (but rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
- Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original maze
- The U-shape is formed by empty spaces (0s), while walls (1s) define the shape's boundaries
