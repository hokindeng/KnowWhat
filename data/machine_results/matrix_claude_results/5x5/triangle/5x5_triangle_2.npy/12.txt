You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current position 'P' is at (2,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Since we can move in any direction (including diagonals) and need to reach the goal on the left side, I'll choose to move diagonally up-left to position (1,1).

However, I notice that position (1,1) is a wall (marked as '1'). Let me check other possible moves:
- Up: (1,2) is a wall
- Down: (3,2) is a wall
- Left: (2,1) is a wall
- Right: (2,3) is a wall
- Up-right: (1,3) is empty
- Down-right: (3,3) is a wall
- Down-left: (3,1) is empty
- Up-left: (1,1) is a wall

I can see that the best path to reach 'G' would be to go through the empty spaces. Looking at the available moves, I'll choose to move up-right to coordinates (1,3), as this will allow me to eventually circle around to reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (1,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 P 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (1,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Looking at the possible moves:
- Up: (0,3) is empty
- Down: (2,3) is a wall
- Left: (1,2) is a wall
- Right: (1,4) is a wall
- Up-right: (0,4) is empty
- Down-right: (2,4) is a wall
- Down-left: (2,2) is empty
- Up-left: (0,2) is empty

The goal is to the left and down from our current position. We need to find a path around the walls to reach it. Looking at the available moves, moving up to (0,3) would give us more flexibility to move towards the goal by using the empty spaces in the top row.

My next move coordinates are: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (0,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Looking at the possible moves:
- Up: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1,3) is empty
- Left: (0,2) is empty
- Right: (0,4) is empty
- Down-right: (1,4) is a wall
- Down-left: (1,2) is a wall
- Up-right: not possible (out of bounds)
- Up-left: not possible (out of bounds)

Since we need to reach 'G' which is on the left side of the maze, and we have a clear path along the top row, the best move is to go left to (0,2). This will allow us to continue moving left in subsequent moves to eventually reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (0,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Looking at the possible moves:
- Up: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1,2) is a wall
- Left: (0,1) is empty
- Right: (0,3) is empty
- Down-right: (1,3) is empty
- Down-left: (1,1) is a wall
- Up-right: not possible (out of bounds)
- Up-left: not possible (out of bounds)

Since we need to reach 'G' which is on the left side of the maze, and we have a clear path along the top row, the best move is to continue moving left to (0,1). This will get us closer to being able to reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (0,1)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Looking at the possible moves:
- Up: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1,1) is a wall
- Left: (0,0) is empty
- Right: (0,2) is empty
- Down-right: (1,2) is a wall
- Down-left: (1,0) is empty
- Up-right: not possible (out of bounds)
- Up-left: not possible (out of bounds)

Since we need to reach 'G' which is at (2,0), and we can now see a clear path to it, the best move is to go left to (0,0). From there, we'll be able to move down to reach the goal in the next move.

My next move coordinates are: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (0,0)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Looking at the possible moves:
- Up: not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1,0) is empty
- Left: not possible (out of bounds)
- Right: (0,1) is empty
- Down-right: (1,1) is a wall
- Down-left: not possible (out of bounds)
- Up-right: not possible (out of bounds)
- Up-left: not possible (out of bounds)

We're now directly above the path to the goal. The best move is to go down to (1,0), which will put us right next to the goal. In the next move, we'll be able to reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

Current position 'P' is at (1,0)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,0)

Looking at the possible moves:
- Up: (0,0) is empty
- Down: (2,0) is the goal 'G'
- Left: not possible (out of bounds)
- Right: (1,1) is a wall
- Down-right: (2,1) is a wall
- Up-right: (0,1) is empty
- Down-left: not possible (out of bounds)
- Up-left: not possible (out of bounds)

We're now right above the goal! The obvious best move is to go down to (2,0) to reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

1) The empty spaces form a general "U" shape, with one arm of the U at the top of the maze and the other arm coming down the left side.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with a similar "U" shape pattern of empty spaces, but with a different wall configuration:

0 0 0 0 P
1 1 1 0 0
G 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Maintains the same 5x5 dimensions
- Has a "U" shaped corridor pattern
- Places P and G in positions that can be connected through empty spaces
- Uses a different wall configuration while maintaining the general "U" shape of the corridors
- The path from P to G follows the U-shaped corridor

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
