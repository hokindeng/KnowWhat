You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 G 1 0
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 P
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the optimal path from P to G.

Current position (P) is at (4,4)
Goal position (G) is at (1,2)

Looking at the maze, I need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls. I notice there's an empty space at (1,4) that can help create a path.

For the first move, I'll move diagonally up-left to position (3,3), which is marked as '0'.

My next move coordinates are: (3,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape (or reversed "7" shape), connecting the bottom-right to the middle-top through a right angle turn.

Here's my new maze with the same "L" shape pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

1 1 1 1 1
1 G 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 P
1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
1. Is 5x5 like the original
2. Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
3. Is different from the original maze
4. Maintains the "L" shape corridor pattern
5. Uses the same encoding (1=wall, 0=empty space, P=player, G=goal)

The empty spaces still form an L-shape path from the bottom-right to the top-middle area, but with a slightly different arrangement of the connecting spaces while maintaining the basic right-angle turn characteristic of an L shape.
