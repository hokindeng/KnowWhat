You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (4,1)
3. There is a path of empty spaces (0s) that can lead to the goal

Looking at the available moves from position (2,1), I can see that moving down to (3,2) would be the best next move as it:
1. Gets us closer to the goal
2. Uses an available empty space (0)
3. Will allow us to eventually reach the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 G 1 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. The player (P) is now at position (3,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (4,1)
3. I can see that we need to move towards the goal which is down and to the left

From the current position (3,2), I can move to the empty space (0) at (4,3), which will then allow me to reach the goal position.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 G 1 P 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,3)
2. The goal (G) is at position (4,1)
3. We can now move directly left through the empty spaces to reach the goal

From the current position (4,3), I can move to the goal position by moving two spaces to the left.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4,1), which is the goal position (G).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze and the path of empty spaces (corridors), I can observe that:

(1) The empty spaces form a general "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), where the path starts at the top, moves diagonally down to the right, and then moves diagonally down to the left.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different arrangement:

1 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 G 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is not identical to the original maze
- Maintains a "Z" shape pattern in its corridors
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
