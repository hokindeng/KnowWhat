You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
P 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

Current position (P) is at (4,0)
Goal position (G) is at (2,0)
I need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls.

Looking at the available moves from position (4,0):
- Up leads to (3,0), which is a wall (1)
- Up-right leads to (3,1), which is an empty space (0)
- Right leads to (4,1), which is a wall (1)

The best move would be to go up-right to coordinate (3,1), as this empty space will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current position (P) is at (3,1)
Goal position (G) is at (2,0)
I need to continue moving towards the goal while avoiding walls.

Looking at the available moves from position (3,1):
- Up leads to (2,1), which is a wall (1)
- Up-right leads to (2,2), which is an empty space (0)
- Right leads to (3,2), which is a wall (1)
- Left leads to (3,0), which is a wall (1)

The best move would be to go up-right to coordinate (2,2), as this empty space will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current position (P) is at (2,2)
Goal position (G) is at (2,0)
I need to continue moving towards the goal while avoiding walls.

Looking at the available moves from position (2,2):
- Left leads to (2,1), which is a wall (1)
- Left-down leads to (3,1), which is an empty space (0)
- Down leads to (3,2), which is a wall (1)
- Right leads to (2,3), which is a wall (1)
- Up leads to (1,2), which is a wall (1)

The only viable move that could eventually lead us to the goal is to go left-down to (3,1), even though we were just there. This will allow us to reposition and try a different approach.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current position (P) is at (3,1)
Goal position (G) is at (2,0)

I notice we're in a loop - we moved from (3,1) to (2,2) and back to (3,1). Looking at all possible moves again:
- Up leads to (2,1), which is a wall (1)
- Up-right leads to (2,2), which is empty (0) but we know that path doesn't lead anywhere
- Right leads to (3,2), which is a wall (1)
- Left leads to (3,0), which is a wall (1)
- Down-left leads to (4,0), which is empty (0)

Since going up-right didn't work, let's try going down-left to (4,0). This might give us a different approach to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
P 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current position (P) is at (4,0)
Goal position (G) is at (2,0)

Looking at the situation, I realize we're in a problematic position. Let's analyze all possible moves:
- Up leads to (3,0), which is a wall (1)
- Up-right leads to (3,1), which is empty (0) but we've already tried that path and it leads nowhere
- Right leads to (4,1), which is a wall (1)

After analyzing all possible moves and our previous attempts, I can conclude that this maze appears to be unsolvable. There is no valid path from our current position to reach the goal at (2,0). All potential paths are blocked by walls.

Should I still provide a move, I would have to choose (3,1) again, but this would just lead us back into the same loop we were in before.

I believe this maze has no solution. Would you like me to confirm this conclusion, or should I still make a move?

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I notice that you've placed me back at position (3,1). Let me analyze the situation again.

Current position (P) is at (3,1)
Goal position (G) is at (2,0)

After our previous attempts and analyzing all possible paths, I can now definitively conclude that this maze is unsolvable. Here's why:

1. From (3,1), we can only move to:
   - (2,2) (up-right): We tried this and it leads nowhere
   - (4,0) (down-left): We tried this and it also leads nowhere
2. All other surrounding positions are walls
3. There is no way to reach the goal at (2,0) because it's completely surrounded by walls except for its current position

Therefore, there is no valid solution to this maze. No sequence of moves will allow us to reach the goal position.

Would you like me to confirm this conclusion, or should I still make a move despite knowing it won't lead to a solution?

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces (0s) in the original maze, they form a "U" shape. However, the walls separate these empty spaces, making it impossible to actually traverse the U-shape to reach the goal.

Here's my answer:

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "U" shape.

(2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with a traversable U-shaped path:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces (0s) clearly form a U shape
- The path is actually traversable from P to G
- The maze maintains the same 5x5 dimensions
- The U shape is clearly recognizable
- It's different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
