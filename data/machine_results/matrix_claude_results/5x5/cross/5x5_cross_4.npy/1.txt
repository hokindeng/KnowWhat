You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
P 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

Current position (P) is at (4,0)
Goal position (G) is at (2,0)
I need to move towards the goal while avoiding walls.

Looking at the available moves from position (4,0):
- Up leads to (3,0), which is a wall (1)
- Up-right leads to (3,1), which is an empty space (0)
- Right leads to (4,1), which is a wall (1)

The best move would be to go up-right to coordinate (3,1), as this empty space will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current position (P) is at (3,1)
Goal position (G) is at (2,0)
I need to continue moving towards the goal while avoiding walls.

Looking at the available moves from position (3,1):
- Up leads to (2,1), which is a wall (1)
- Up-right leads to (2,2), which is an empty space (0)
- Right leads to (3,2), which is a wall (1)
- Left leads to (3,0), which is a wall (1)

The best move would be to go up-right to coordinate (2,2), as this empty space will help me progress towards the goal position.

I choose to move to coordinates: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current position (P) is at (2,2)
Goal position (G) is at (2,0)
I need to continue moving towards the goal while avoiding walls.

Looking at the available moves from position (2,2):
- Left leads to (2,1), which is a wall (1)
- Left-down leads to (3,1), which is an empty space (0)
- Down leads to (3,2), which is a wall (1)
- Right leads to (2,3), which is a wall (1)
- Up leads to (1,2), which is a wall (1)

Since I need to get to (2,0) and there's no direct path from here, I need to backtrack. The only valid move is to go left-down back to (3,1).

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current position (P) is at (3,1)
Goal position (G) is at (2,0)

I've been in this position before and tried going up-right to (2,2), which led to a dead end. Looking at my available moves again:
- Up leads to (2,1), which is a wall (1)
- Up-right leads to (2,2), which we know leads nowhere
- Right leads to (3,2), which is a wall (1)
- Left leads to (3,0), which is a wall (1)
- Down leads to (4,1), which is a wall (1)
- Down-left leads to (4,0), which is an empty space (0)

Since we've tried the upward path and it didn't work, let's try going down-left to (4,0). This might give us a different approach to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
P 1 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current position (P) is at (4,0)
Goal position (G) is at (2,0)

I've returned to the starting position, and after exploring the path through (3,1) and (2,2), I can see that route doesn't lead to the goal. Looking at the maze structure again:

The goal is directly two spaces above me at (2,0), but there's a wall at (3,0) blocking the direct path. I've tried the path through (3,1) which didn't work. The only remaining unexplored path would be through the empty spaces at (4,2), but that would take me further from the goal and there's no way to circle back to (2,0) from there.

After exploring all possible paths, I can conclude that this maze appears to be unsolvable - there is no valid path from the current position (4,0) to the goal position (2,0).

Should I still make a move, or would you like me to confirm that the maze is unsolvable?

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces (0s) in the original maze, they form a "Z" shape, but the Z is disconnected between its segments, which is why the maze is unsolvable.

Here's my answer:

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "Z"

(2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with a connected Z-shaped path that is solvable:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
G 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 P 1 1

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form a clear, connected Z shape
- P can reach G by following the Z-shaped path
- The maze maintains the same dimensions (5x5)
- The Z shape is clearly recognizable but positioned differently than in the original maze
- The path is continuous, unlike in the original maze where the Z segments were disconnected

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
