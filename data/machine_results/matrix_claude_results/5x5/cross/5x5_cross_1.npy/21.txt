You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal 'G'.

Current observations:
- The player 'P' is at position (1,1)
- The goal 'G' is at position (1,3)
- There is an empty space '0' at (2,2) that can help reach the goal

The most efficient path would be to move diagonally to the empty space at (2,2), and then diagonally to the goal.

For my first move, I choose to move to coordinates (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I am at position (2,2), and I can see that the goal 'G' is at (1,3).

From my current position, I can move diagonally up-right to reach the goal position.

For my next move, I choose to move to coordinates (1,3) where the goal 'G' is located.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze (including P and G positions), they form a "Z" shape, with one diagonal line connecting two horizontal segments.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (5x5) that also forms a Z shape with its empty spaces, but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The Z shape is still present but slightly modified
- The path starts at P in the top left area
- Moves horizontally right through empty spaces
- Has a diagonal segment
- Ends at G in the bottom right area
- The maze is surrounded by walls (1s)
- The path from P to G is valid and achievable
- The overall structure is different from the original maze while maintaining the Z shape
