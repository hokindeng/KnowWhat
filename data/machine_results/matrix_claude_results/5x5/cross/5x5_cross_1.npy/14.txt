You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 G 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal 'G'.

Current observations:
- The maze is 5x5
- Player 'P' is at position (1,1)
- Goal 'G' is at position (1,3)
- There is a path through (2,2) that can connect P to G

Since diagonal moves are allowed, I can move diagonally to position (2,2), which is an empty space (0).

I choose to move to coordinates: (2,2)

This will be a good first step as it brings us closer to the goal while using an available empty space.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 G 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 0 1 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (2,2), and I need to reach the goal at (1,3).

Since diagonal moves are allowed, I can move diagonally up-right from my current position to reach the goal directly.

I choose to move to coordinates: (1,3)

This move will take me directly to the goal position 'G'.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern) from P to G.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with a "Z" shaped path that maintains the same general pattern but with slightly different positioning:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 G 1
1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is not identical to the original
- Maintains a "Z" shape pattern in its corridors
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)

The Z-shape is formed by the path starting at P, moving right, then diagonally down-right, and finally right again to reach G.
