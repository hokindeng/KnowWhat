You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. There's a wall formation blocking the direct path to the goal
4. I need to find a path around the walls

Looking at the available moves from the current position (4,1):
- Up: (3,1) - blocked by wall
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: (4,0) - valid move
- Right: (4,2) - valid move

The best strategy would be to move up and around the wall formation to reach the goal. To do this, I should first move to the left side of the maze and then work my way up and around.

I choose to move LEFT to position (4,0).

My next move coordinates are: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,0)
2. The goal (G) is still at position (3,4)
3. From my current position, I need to move up and then work my way to the right

Looking at the available moves from the current position (4,0):
- Up: (3,0) - valid move
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (4,1) - valid move, but this would be going backwards

The best path will be to move upward along the left side of the maze, so I choose to move UP to position (3,0).

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (0,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I've reached the point where I need to start moving down since there's a wall to the right

Looking at the available moves from the current position (0,2):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,2) - valid move
- Left: (0,1) - valid move, but this would be going backwards
- Right: (0,3) - blocked by wall

The best path is to move DOWN to position (1,2), which will allow me to continue making progress towards the goal.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (1,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I need to continue moving down through this open corridor

Looking at the available moves from the current position (1,2):
- Up: (0,2) - valid move, but this would be going backwards
- Down: (2,2) - valid move
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall

The best path is to move DOWN to position (2,2), continuing through the corridor that will eventually lead to the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I've reached a point where I can't continue down due to a wall
4. I need to find a way around to reach the goal

Looking at the available moves from the current position (2,2):
- Up: (1,2) - valid move, but this would be going backwards
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall

Since I'm blocked on most sides and can't continue directly towards the goal, I need to backtrack and find another path. The best option is to move UP to position (1,2) and then try to find an alternative route.

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (1,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I realize I need to find a different approach since the direct path down is blocked

Looking at the available moves from the current position (1,2):
- Up: (0,2) - valid move
- Down: (2,2) - valid move, but I just came from there and it's a dead end
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall

After reconsidering the maze layout, I notice that I need to go back up and try to find a path that goes around the right side of the maze. Let's move UP to position (0,2) and then try to find a path to the right side.

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (0,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. Looking at the maze again, I notice there might be a path through the right side

Looking at the available moves from the current position (0,2):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,2) - valid move, but I just came from there
- Left: (0,1) - valid move
- Right: (0,3) - blocked by wall

After analyzing the maze more carefully, I notice that there might be a path if I go to position (0,4) and then work my way down the right side. To do this, I first need to move RIGHT to position (0,4) through the top row.

Let me move LEFT to (0,1) first, as I need to go around the wall at (0,3).

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (0,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I need to continue moving towards the right side of the maze

Looking at the available moves from the current position (0,1):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: (0,0) - valid move, but this would take me further from the goal
- Right: (0,2) - valid move

Since I want to reach the right side of the maze to access the goal, I should move RIGHT to position (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (0,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I notice that I'm starting to go in circles
4. Looking at the maze more carefully, I see that I can reach position (0,4) by going through the gap at (0,3)

Looking at the available moves from the current position (0,2):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,2) - we've tried this path before
- Left: (0,1) - would be going backwards
- Right: (0,3) - blocked by wall

After a more thorough analysis, I realize I've been going in circles. The correct path must involve getting to the right side of the maze. Since I can't go directly right due to the wall at (0,3), I should try going DOWN to (1,2) again, but this time with the intention of finding a path to the right side of the maze.

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (1,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. Looking at the maze with fresh eyes, I notice that I can't reach the goal through the right side due to the continuous wall
4. I need to find a way to reach the goal from the bottom of the maze

Looking at the available moves from the current position (1,2):
- Up: (0,2) - we've been here before
- Down: (2,2) - valid move
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall

Since we can't reach the goal from the top or right side due to the walls, let's try going down and then finding a path from the bottom of the maze. The goal might be accessible from below.

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I notice that I can't go down due to the wall at (3,2)
4. Looking at the entire maze again, I realize I need to get to the bottom row and then move right to reach the goal

Looking at the available moves from the current position (2,2):
- Up: (1,2) - we've been here before
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall

After a complete review of the maze, I realize I need to:
1. Go back up and around
2. Get to the bottom row through the left side
3. Move right along the bottom row to reach the goal

Let's start by moving UP to (1,2) again, but this time with a clear plan to reach the bottom row.

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape. The path requires going up one side, across the top, and then down the other side to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with a U-shaped path:

P 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

This new maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original maze
- Maintains a U-shaped corridor pattern where the player must go right along the top, down the right side, and across the bottom (or the reverse path) to reach the goal
