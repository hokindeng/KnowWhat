You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. There's a wall formation blocking the direct path to the goal
4. I need to find a path around the walls

Looking at the available moves from the current position (4,1):
- Up: (3,1) - blocked by wall
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: (4,0) - valid move
- Right: (4,2) - valid move

The best strategy would be to move up and around the wall formation to reach the goal. To do this, I should first move to the left side of the maze and then work my way up and around.

I choose to move LEFT to position (4,0).

My next move coordinates are: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,0)
2. The goal (G) is still at position (3,4)
3. From my current position, I need to move up and then work my way to the right

Looking at the available moves from the current position (4,0):
- Up: (3,0) - valid move
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (4,1) - valid move, but this would be going backwards

The best path will be to move upward along the left side of the maze, so I choose to move UP to position (3,0).

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (3,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I need to continue moving up along the left side of the maze

Looking at the available moves from the current position (3,0):
- Up: (2,0) - valid move
- Down: (4,0) - valid move, but this would be going backwards
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (3,1) - blocked by wall

The best path is to continue moving upward along the left side, so I choose to move UP to position (2,0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I should continue moving up and then start moving right when possible

Looking at the available moves from the current position (2,0):
- Up: (1,0) - valid move
- Down: (3,0) - valid move, but this would be going backwards
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (2,2) - blocked by wall

The best path is to continue moving upward along the left side, so I choose to move UP to position (1,0).

My next move coordinates are: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

3. I can now start moving right through the open path

Looking at the available moves from the current position (1,0):
- Up: (0,0) - valid move
- Down: (2,0) - valid move, but this would be going backwards
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (1,2) - blocked by wall

The best path is to move UP to position (0,0), which will allow me to then move right and navigate around the walls to reach the goal.

- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,1) - blocked by wall
- Left: (0,0) - valid move, but this would be going backwards
- Right: (0,2) - valid move

The best path is to move RIGHT to position (0,2), continuing along the top row.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (0,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I've hit a wall to my right, so I need to move down through the open corridor

Looking at the available moves from the current position (0,2):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,2) - valid move
- Left: (0,1) - valid move, but this would be going backwards
- Right: (0,3) - blocked by wall

The best path is to move DOWN to position (1,2), which will allow me to continue moving towards the goal through the open corridor.

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (1,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I need to continue moving down through this corridor

Looking at the available moves from the current position (1,2):
- Up: (0,2) - valid move, but this would be going backwards
- Down: (2,2) - valid move
- Left: (1,1) - blocked by wall
- Right: (1,3) - blocked by wall

The best path is to move DOWN to position (2,2), continuing through the corridor that will eventually lead to the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I've reached a point where I need to move right to get to the goal, but there's a wall blocking the direct path
4. I need to go down and around through the bottom of the maze

Looking at the available moves from the current position (2,2):
- Up: (1,2) - valid move, but this would be going backwards
- Down: (3,2) - blocked by wall
- Left: (2,1) - blocked by wall
- Right: (2,3) - blocked by wall

Since I'm blocked on all sides except up (which would be going backwards), I need to backtrack and find another path. The best alternative route would be to go back up and then find a path around through the bottom of the maze.

I choose to move UP to position (1,2).

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (1,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I realize I need to find a different route since the middle corridor is blocked
4. I should try going down to the bottom row and then right to reach the goal

Looking at the available moves from the current position (1,2):
- Up: (0,2) - valid move
- Down: (2,2) - valid move, but we just came from there
- Left: (1,1) - blocked by wall
- Right: (1,3) - blocked by wall

Since we've discovered that the middle path doesn't work, let's go back UP to (0,2) so we can try a different route.

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. After exploring the middle path, I realize we need to use the bottom path
4. We should go back to the left side and then down to the bottom row

- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,2) - we just came from there
- Left: (0,1) - valid move

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape. The path requires going down one side of the U, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with a U-shaped corridor pattern:

P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 G
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 0

This new maze:
- Is 5x5 like the original
- Has a clear U-shaped path
- Requires the same basic movement pattern (down one side, across bottom, up other side)
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the U shape
- Has valid start (P) and goal (G) positions that can be reached through empty spaces
