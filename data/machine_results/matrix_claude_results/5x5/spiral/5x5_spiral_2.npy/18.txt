You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. There's a wall formation blocking the direct path to the goal
4. I need to find a path around the walls

Looking at the available moves from the current position (4,1):
- Up: (3,1) - blocked by wall
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: (4,0) - valid move
- Right: (4,2) - valid move

The best strategy would be to move up and around the wall formation to reach the goal. To do this, I should first move to the left side of the maze and then work my way up and around.

I choose to move LEFT to position (4,0).

My next move coordinates are: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (4,0). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: (3,0) - valid move
2. Down: not possible (outside maze)
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: (4,1) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from

The best strategy is to move upward along the left side of the maze, which will allow me to eventually reach the goal by going around the wall formation.

I choose to move UP to position (3,0).

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (3,0). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: (2,0) - valid move
2. Down: (4,0) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: (3,1) - blocked by wall

The best strategy is to continue moving upward along the left side of the maze until I can move right towards the goal.

I choose to move UP to position (2,0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (2,0). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: (1,0) - valid move
2. Down: (3,0) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: (2,2) - valid move, but blocked by wall at (2,1)

The best strategy is to continue moving upward along the left side of the maze until I can move right towards the goal.

I choose to move UP to position (1,0).

My next move coordinates are: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (1,0). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: (0,0) - valid move
2. Down: (2,0) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: (1,2) - valid move, but blocked by wall at (1,1)

The best strategy is to continue moving upward, which will allow me to then move right across the top of the maze and eventually down to the goal.

I choose to move UP to position (0,0).

My next move coordinates are: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,0). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: not possible (outside maze)
2. Down: (1,0) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: (0,1) - valid move

Now that I've reached the top of the maze, I can start moving right across the top row, which will eventually allow me to move down to the goal.

I choose to move RIGHT to position (0,1).

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,1). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: not possible (outside maze)
2. Down: (1,1) - blocked by wall
3. Left: (0,0) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
4. Right: (0,2) - valid move

I should continue moving right across the top row to eventually reach a path down to the goal.

I choose to move RIGHT to position (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,2). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: not possible (outside maze)
2. Down: (1,2) - valid move
3. Left: (0,1) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
4. Right: (0,3) - blocked by wall

Looking at the maze, I can now see that I should move down through the middle column of empty spaces (column 2) to get closer to the goal.

I choose to move DOWN to position (1,2).

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (1,2). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: (0,2) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
2. Down: (2,2) - valid move
3. Left: blocked by wall at (1,1)
4. Right: blocked by wall at (1,3)

I should continue moving down through this column of empty spaces to get closer to the goal.

I choose to move DOWN to position (2,2).

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (2,2). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: (1,2) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
2. Down: blocked by wall at (3,2)
3. Left: blocked by wall at (2,1)
4. Right: blocked by wall at (2,3)

I notice that I've reached a dead end - I can't continue down due to the wall at (3,2), and I'm blocked on both sides. The only valid move would be to go back up. I need to find a different route to the goal.

Since I can't go through the middle section to reach the goal, I should go back up and try to find a path around the right side of the maze.

I choose to move UP to position (1,2).

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (1,2). Let me analyze the situation again:

I realize I need to rethink my strategy. Looking at the maze:
1. The middle path is blocked by walls at the bottom
2. The left side path (where we started) doesn't lead to the goal
3. We haven't tried going through the right side yet
4. There appears to be an empty space at (0,4) that might lead to the goal

Let me analyze my available moves:
1. Up: (0,2) - valid move
2. Down: (2,2) - we know this leads to a dead end
3. Left: blocked by wall at (1,1)
4. Right: blocked by wall at (1,3)

I should go back up and try to find a path through the right side of the maze.

I choose to move UP to position (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,2). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: not possible (outside maze)
2. Down: (1,2) - we know this path leads to a dead end
3. Left: (0,1) - valid move, but we've already explored that way
4. Right: (0,4) - can't move directly there due to wall at (0,3)

Looking at the maze again, I notice that I can't actually reach the goal from the top right either, as there's a continuous wall of '1's blocking access to the goal position.

Let me revise my analysis of the entire maze:
- The goal is at (3,4)
- There's a continuous wall blocking direct access from the top
- The only way to reach the goal must be from the bottom row

Therefore, I need to go back down to the bottom row and try to reach the goal from there.

I choose to move LEFT to position (0,1) as the first step to getting back to the bottom row.

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,1). Let me analyze the situation:

I need to get to the bottom row to reach the goal, since that's the only way around the continuous wall. From the bottom row, I should be able to move right to reach the goal position.

Available moves:
1. Up: not possible (outside maze)
2. Down: blocked by wall at (1,1)
3. Left: (0,0) - valid move
4. Right: (0,2) - valid move, but we just came from there

I'll continue moving left and then down along the left side of the maze to reach the bottom row.

I choose to move LEFT to position (0,0).

My next move coordinates are: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,0). Let me analyze the situation:

I need to get to the bottom row to reach the goal. From there, I can move right to reach the goal position.

Available moves:
1. Up: not possible (outside maze)
2. Down: (1,0) - valid move
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: (0,1) - valid move, but we just came from there

I'll move down along the left side of the maze to reach the bottom row.

I choose to move DOWN to position (1,0).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (1,0). Let me analyze the situation:

I need to continue moving down to reach the bottom row, from where I can move right to reach the goal.

Available moves:
1. Up: (0,0) - valid move, but we just came from there
2. Down: (2,0) - valid move
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: blocked by wall at (1,1)

I'll continue moving down along the left side of the maze.

I choose to move DOWN to position (2,0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (2,0). Let me analyze the situation:

I need to continue moving down to reach the bottom row, from where I can move right to reach the goal.

Available moves:
1. Up: (1,0) - valid move, but we just came from there
2. Down: (3,0) - valid move
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: blocked by wall at (2,1)

I'll continue moving down to reach the bottom row.

I choose to move DOWN to position (3,0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

(1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape. The path requires going down the left side, across the bottom, and up the right side to reach the goal.

(2) Here's a new maze with the same U-shaped corridor pattern:

P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 G
1 1 1 1 0

This new maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original maze
- Maintains a U-shaped corridor pattern
- Forces the player to go down one side, across, and up the other side to reach the goal

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
