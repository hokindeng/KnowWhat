You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. There's a wall formation blocking the direct path to the goal
4. We need to go around the walls to reach the goal

Looking at the available moves from position (4,1):
- Up: (3,1) - blocked by wall
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: (4,0) - valid move
- Right: (4,2) - valid move

The best strategy would be to move up and around the wall formation to reach the goal. To do this, we should first move left to (4,0), then work our way up and around.

I choose to move to position (4,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4,0), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We need to go up and around the wall formation

Looking at the available moves from position (4,0):
- Up: (3,0) - valid move
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (4,1) - valid move, but this would be going back

The best path to the goal would be to move upward and then work our way to the right. 

I choose to move to position (3,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3,0), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (3,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We need to continue moving up to get around the wall formation

Looking at the available moves from position (3,0):
- Up: (2,0) - valid move
- Down: (4,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (3,1) - blocked by wall

The best path to the goal would be to continue moving upward until we can move to the right and reach the goal.

I choose to move to position (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We can now start moving up and then right to get around the wall formation

Looking at the available moves from position (1,0):
- Up: (0,0) - valid move
- Down: (2,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (1,1) - blocked by wall

The best path to the goal would be to move up to (0,0) and then we can start moving right through the open path at the top of the maze.

I choose to move to position (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0

2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We can now move right along the top row until we need to move down

Looking at the available moves from position (0,0):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (0,1) - valid move

The best path to the goal would be to move right along the top row until we reach the wall, then we can move down through the open path to reach the goal.

I choose to move to position (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (0,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We should continue moving right along the top row

Looking at the available moves from position (0,1):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,1) - blocked by wall
- Left: (0,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Right: (0,2) - valid move

The best path to the goal would be to continue moving right until we reach the wall, then we can move down through the open path to reach the goal.

I choose to move to position (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,2), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (0,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We've reached the point where we need to start moving down through the open path

Looking at the available moves from position (0,2):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,2) - valid move
- Left: (0,1) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Right: (0,3) - blocked by wall

The best path to the goal would be to move down through the open vertical path, which will eventually allow us to reach the goal.

I choose to move to position (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1,2), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (1,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We should continue moving down through this open path

Looking at the available moves from position (1,2):
- Up: (0,2) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Down: (2,2) - valid move
- Left: (1,1) - blocked by wall
- Right: (1,3) - blocked by wall

The best path to the goal would be to continue moving down through this vertical path until we can move right to reach the goal.

I choose to move to position (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2,2), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. Moving down is blocked by a wall at (3,2)

Looking at the available moves from position (2,2):
- Up: (1,2) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Down: (3,2) - blocked by wall
- Left: (2,1) - blocked by wall
- Right: (2,3) - blocked by wall

I notice that we've reached a dead end. The path we took doesn't lead to the goal because there's a continuous wall blocking our way to the goal. We need to backtrack and find another route.

I choose to move back to position (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we've backtracked to position (1,2), I need to reconsider the entire path strategy.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (1,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. Our previous route through the middle vertical path led to a dead end
4. Looking at the maze again, we need to find a path that allows us to reach the rightmost column where the goal is

Looking at the available moves from position (1,2):
- Up: (0,2) - valid move
- Down: (2,2) - leads to dead end (we just came from there)
- Left: (1,1) - blocked by wall
- Right: (1,3) - blocked by wall

Since we've discovered that going down leads to a dead end, and we can't move right directly from here, let's go back up to explore if there might be another path.

I choose to move to position (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're back at position (0,2), let me completely reassess the maze.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (0,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We've learned that the middle vertical path leads to a dead end
4. Looking at the entire maze again, I notice that we might need to go around the entire wall structure by going down the leftmost column

Looking at the available moves from position (0,2):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,2) - leads to dead end path
- Left: (0,1) - valid move
- Right: (0,3) - blocked by wall

Since we've discovered that the middle path doesn't work, let's try a completely different approach by going back left and then trying to go around the wall structure using the leftmost column.

I choose to move to position (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at position (0,1), let me continue with the new strategy.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (0,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We need to try going around the entire wall structure
4. The leftmost column appears to be completely open

Looking at the available moves from position (0,1):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,1) - blocked by wall
- Left: (0,0) - valid move
- Right: (0,2) - valid move but we just came from there

To execute our new strategy of going around the wall structure using the leftmost column, we should move to the leftmost column.

I choose to move to position (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at position (0,0), let's execute our new strategy.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (0,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. The leftmost column is completely open
4. We can go down the leftmost column and then try to reach the goal from the bottom

Looking at the available moves from position (0,0):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,0) - valid move
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (0,1) - valid move but we just came from there

To execute our strategy of going around the wall structure, we should move down the leftmost column.

I choose to move to position (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at position (1,0), let's continue with our strategy.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (1,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We're moving down the leftmost column
4. This should allow us to get below the wall structure

Looking at the available moves from position (1,0):
- Up: (0,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Down: (2,0) - valid move
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (1,1) - blocked by wall

Continuing with our strategy of going down the leftmost column to get around the wall structure.

I choose to move to position (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that we're at position (2,0), let's continue with our strategy.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We're continuing down the leftmost column
4. Once we reach the bottom row, we should be able to move right towards the goal

Looking at the available moves from position (2,0):
- Up: (1,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Down: (3,0) - valid move
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (2,1) - blocked by wall

Continuing with our strategy of going down the leftmost column until we reach the bottom row.

I choose to move to position (3,0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

(1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape. The path requires going down one side of the U, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal.

(2) Here's a new maze with a U-shaped path that maintains the same basic concept but with a different wall arrangement:

P 0 1 0 G
1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 0 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions
- Forms a U-shaped corridor
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Uses a different wall arrangement while maintaining the U shape
- Requires the same basic strategy (go down one side, across, and up the other side)
