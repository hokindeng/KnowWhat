You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. There's a wall formation blocking the direct path to the goal
4. We need to go around the walls to reach the goal

Looking at the available moves from position (4,1):
- Up: (3,1) - blocked by wall
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: (4,0) - valid move
- Right: (4,2) - valid move

The best strategy would be to move up and around the wall formation to reach the goal. To do this, we should first move left to (4,0), then work our way up and around.

I choose to move to position (4,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4,0), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We need to go up and around the wall formation

Looking at the available moves from position (4,0):
- Up: (3,0) - valid move
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (4,1) - valid move, but this would be going back

The best path to the goal will be to go up along the left side of the maze, then move right across the top, and finally down to the goal. Therefore, I should move up.

I choose to move to position (3,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3,0), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (3,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We need to continue moving up to get around the wall formation

Looking at the available moves from position (3,0):
- Up: (2,0) - valid move
- Down: (4,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: blocked by wall

Continuing with the strategy to go up along the left side, then across the top, and finally down to the goal, I should keep moving up.

I choose to move to position (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2,0), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We need to continue moving up to get around the wall formation

Looking at the available moves from position (2,0):
- Up: (1,0) - valid move
- Down: (3,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: blocked by wall

Continuing with the strategy to go up along the left side, then across the top, and finally down to the goal, I should keep moving up.

I choose to move to position (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1,0), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (1,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We can now start moving up and then right across the top of the maze

Looking at the available moves from position (1,0):
- Up: (0,0) - valid move
- Down: (2,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: blocked by wall

Following our strategy to go up and then across the top of the maze, I should move up one more time.

I choose to move to position (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,0), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (0,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We've reached the top of the maze and can now move right

Looking at the available moves from position (0,0):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (0,1) - valid move

Now that we've reached the top, we can start moving right across the top of the maze to eventually reach the goal.

I choose to move to position (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,1), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (0,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We should continue moving right across the top of the maze

Looking at the available moves from position (0,1):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: (0,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Right: (0,2) - valid move

Continuing with our strategy to move across the top of the maze, we should keep moving right.

I choose to move to position (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,2), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (0,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We need to continue moving towards the goal

Looking at the available moves from position (0,2):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,2) - valid move
- Left: (0,1) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Right: blocked by wall

Since we can't move right anymore due to the wall, and we need to eventually get to the goal which is on the right side, we should start moving down through the open corridor.

I choose to move to position (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1,2), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (1,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We need to continue moving down through this corridor

Looking at the available moves from position (1,2):
- Up: (0,2) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Down: (2,2) - valid move
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall

We should continue moving down through this corridor as it will eventually allow us to reach the goal position.

I choose to move to position (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2,2), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We need to find a way around the wall blocking direct access to the goal

Looking at the available moves from position (2,2):
- Up: (1,2) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall

I notice that we've reached a dead end in this corridor. The path down is blocked by a wall, and we can't move directly to the goal. We need to backtrack and find another route.

I choose to move back up to position (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at position (1,2), let me analyze the situation again.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (1,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We've discovered that going down the middle corridor leads to a dead end
4. Looking at the maze again, we need to go up and then try to reach the goal from the top-right

Looking at the available moves from position (1,2):
- Up: (0,2) - valid move
- Down: (2,2) - leads to dead end
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall

Since we know the lower path is a dead end, we should go back up and try to find a path through the top-right section of the maze.

I choose to move to position (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at position (0,2), let me analyze the situation again.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (0,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We've discovered that the middle corridor leads to a dead end
4. Looking at the maze more carefully, I notice there's a path through the right side that we haven't tried yet

Looking at the available moves from position (0,2):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,2) - leads to the dead end we just came from
- Left: (0,1) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Right: blocked by wall

After reconsidering the entire maze, I realize we need to find a different approach. Let's try going back left and find another route.

I choose to move to position (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,1), let me reconsider the entire maze and our strategy.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (0,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We've tried the middle corridor which led to a dead end
4. Looking at the maze again, I notice we might be able to reach the goal by going around the entire wall structure from the bottom

Looking at the available moves from position (0,1):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: (0,0) - valid move
- Right: (0,2) - we just came from there and know it doesn't work

After exploring the top and middle paths with no success, we should try a completely different approach. Let's go back to the bottom of the maze and try to reach the goal from there.

I choose to move to position (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,0), let me try a completely different approach.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (0,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We've tried paths through the top and middle with no success
4. Looking at the maze again, we can try going down the left side and then across the bottom to reach the goal

Looking at the available moves from position (0,0):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,0) - valid move
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (0,1) - we just came from there

Let's try a new path by going down the left side of the maze, then we can move across the bottom row to reach the goal.

I choose to move to position (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1,0), let me continue with the new strategy.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (1,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We're trying to reach the goal by going down the left side and across the bottom

Looking at the available moves from position (1,0):
- Up: (0,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Down: (2,0) - valid move
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: blocked by wall

Continuing with our strategy to go down the left side of the maze, then across the bottom to reach the goal.

I choose to move to position (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2,0), let me continue with our strategy.

Current observations:

2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We're continuing down the left side to eventually reach the goal from the bottom

Looking at the available moves from position (2,0):
- Up: (1,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Down: (3,0) - valid move
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: blocked by wall

Continuing with our strategy to go down the left side and then across the bottom to reach the goal.

I choose to move to position (3,0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

(1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape. The path requires going down one side of the U, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal.

(2) Here's a new maze with a similar U-shaped corridor pattern:

P 0 1 0 G
0 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0

This new maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions
- Forms a U-shaped corridor
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze
- Maintains the U-shape concept where the player must go down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal
