You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. There's a wall formation blocking the direct path to the goal
4. I need to find a path around the walls

Looking at the available moves from the current position (4,1):
- Up: (3,1) - blocked by wall
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: (4,0) - valid move
- Right: (4,2) - valid move

The best strategy would be to move up and around the wall formation to reach the goal. To do this, I should first move to the left side of the maze and then work my way up and around.

I choose to move LEFT to position (4,0).

My next move coordinates are: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,0)
2. The goal (G) is still at position (3,4)
3. From my current position, I need to move up and then work my way to the right

Looking at the available moves from the current position (4,0):
- Up: (3,0) - valid move
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (4,1) - valid move, but this would be going backwards

The best path will be to move upward along the left side of the maze, so I'll move UP to position (3,0).

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0

2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I can now move down since moving right is blocked by a wall

Looking at the available moves from the current position (0,2):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,2) - valid move
- Left: (0,1) - valid move, but this would be going backwards
- Right: (0,3) - blocked by wall

The best path is to move DOWN to position (1,2), which will allow me to continue moving down and eventually reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G

2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I should continue moving down through the open path

Looking at the available moves from the current position (1,2):
- Up: (0,2) - valid move, but this would be going backwards
- Down: (2,2) - valid move
- Left: not possible (blocked by wall)
- Right: not possible (blocked by wall)

The best path is to move DOWN to position (2,2), continuing along the vertical path that will eventually lead to the goal.

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. Moving down is blocked by a wall, so I need to move right to get to the goal

Looking at the available moves from the current position (2,2):
- Up: (1,2) - valid move, but this would be going backwards
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: not possible (blocked by wall)
- Right: not possible (blocked by wall)
- Up: (1,2) - valid move, but this would be going backwards

I notice that I've reached a dead end. I need to backtrack and find another path. Let's move back UP to position (1,2) and try to find an alternative route.

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (1,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I realize I need to find a different path since the downward route led to a dead end

Looking at the available moves from the current position (1,2):
- Up: (0,2) - valid move
- Down: (2,2) - valid move but leads to dead end
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall

Since going down led to a dead end, and we need to ultimately reach the goal at (3,4), we should go back up and try to find a path that might lead us around the wall formation.

Let's move UP to position (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (0,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. Looking at the maze again, I notice that we need to find a path that leads to the right side of the maze

Looking at the available moves from the current position (0,2):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,2) - leads to dead end
- Left: (0,1) - valid move
- Right: (0,3) - blocked by wall

Since going down leads to a dead end, and we can't go right due to the wall, let's try going through the bottom of the maze. We should move LEFT to (0,1) and then work our way down and around through the bottom path.

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (0,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I realize we need to try reaching the goal from the bottom of the maze

Looking at the available moves from the current position (0,1):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: (0,0) - valid move
- Right: (0,2) - valid move but we just came from there

Since we've tried the upper paths and they led to dead ends, we should try to reach the goal from the bottom of the maze. Let's move LEFT to (0,0) and then we can work our way down the left side and try to reach the goal from below.

My next move coordinates are: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,0) - valid move
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (0,1) - valid move but we just came from there

Let's try the path through the bottom of the maze. We should move DOWN to (1,0) and then continue down to the bottom row, where we might be able to reach the goal from below.

My next move coordinates are: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

- Up: (0,0) - valid move but we just came from there
- Down: (2,0) - valid move
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: blocked by wall

Continuing with our plan to reach the bottom of the maze, let's move DOWN to (2,0) which will help us get to the bottom row where we can potentially reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

- Up: (1,0) - valid move but we just came from there
- Down: (3,0) - valid move
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: blocked by wall

Continuing with our plan to reach the bottom of the maze, let's move DOWN to (3,0) which will get us to the bottom row. From there, we should be able to move right through the open path at the bottom to reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape. The path requires going down one side of the U, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size that maintains a U-shaped corridor pattern but with a different wall arrangement:

P 0 1 0 G
1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions
- Forms a U-shaped corridor
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Has a different wall arrangement than the original
- Maintains the basic U-shape concept where the player must go down one side, across, and up the other side to reach the goal

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
