You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. There's a wall formation blocking the direct path to the goal
4. I need to find a path around the walls

Looking at the available moves from the current position (4,1):
- Up: (3,1) - blocked by wall
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: (4,0) - valid move
- Right: (4,2) - valid move

The best strategy would be to move up and around the wall formation to reach the goal. To do this, I should first move to the left side of the maze and then work my way up and around.

I choose to move LEFT to position (4,0).

My next move coordinates are: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (4,0). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: (3,0) - valid move
2. Down: not possible (outside maze)
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: (4,1) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from

The best strategy is to move upward along the left side of the maze, which will allow me to eventually reach the goal by going around the wall formation.

I choose to move UP to position (3,0).

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (3,0). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: (2,0) - valid move
2. Down: (4,0) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: (3,1) - blocked by wall

The best strategy is to continue moving upward along the left side of the maze until I can move right towards the goal.

I choose to move UP to position (2,0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (2,0). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: (1,0) - valid move
2. Down: (3,0) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: (2,2) - blocked by wall

The best strategy is to continue moving upward along the left side of the maze until I can move right towards the goal.

I choose to move UP to position (1,0).

My next move coordinates are: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (1,0). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: (0,0) - valid move
2. Down: (2,0) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: (1,2) - blocked by wall

The best strategy is to continue moving upward, and then I'll be able to move right across the top of the maze towards the goal.

I choose to move UP to position (0,0).

My next move coordinates are: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,0). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: not possible (outside maze)
2. Down: (1,0) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: (0,1) - valid move

Now that I've reached the top of the maze, I can start moving right towards the goal. There's a clear path along the top row until the wall at (0,3).

I choose to move RIGHT to position (0,1).

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,1). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: not possible (outside maze)
2. Down: not possible (blocked by wall)
3. Left: (0,0) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
4. Right: (0,2) - valid move

I should continue moving right along the top row to get closer to the goal.

I choose to move RIGHT to position (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,2). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: not possible (outside maze)
2. Down: (1,2) - valid move
3. Left: (0,1) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
4. Right: (0,3) - blocked by wall

I can't continue right because of the wall at (0,3). However, I notice there's a path downward through the middle of the maze that will lead to the goal. 

I choose to move DOWN to position (1,2).

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0

0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (1,2). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: (0,2) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
2. Down: (2,2) - valid move
3. Left: not possible (blocked by wall)
4. Right: not possible (blocked by wall)

I should continue moving down through this middle passage, which will eventually lead me to the bottom where I can reach the goal.

I choose to move DOWN to position (2,2).

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (2,2). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: (1,2) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
2. Down: not possible (blocked by wall)
3. Left: not possible (blocked by wall)
4. Right: not possible (blocked by wall)

I notice I've reached a dead end. The path down is blocked by a wall, and I can't move left or right. The only option is to go back up and find a different route to the goal.

I choose to move UP to position (1,2).

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm back at position (1,2). Let me reassess the situation:

1. Up: (0,2) - valid move
2. Down: (2,2) - valid move, but I just found out it leads to a dead end
3. Left: not possible (blocked by wall)
4. Right: not possible (blocked by wall)

I need to rethink my strategy. Going down through the middle doesn't work because of the wall blocking the path to the goal. Looking at the maze again, I notice that I need to find a way to get to the right side of the maze to reach the goal. The only path appears to be going back up and finding a different route.

I choose to move UP to position (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm back at position (0,2). Let me completely reassess the situation:

1. Up: not possible (outside maze)
2. Down: (1,2) - leads to dead end as we discovered
3. Left: (0,1) - valid move
4. Right: (0,3) - blocked by wall

Looking at the entire maze again, I realize we need to find a path that reaches the goal from the bottom of the maze, since the middle passage is blocked. We should go back to the left side, down to the bottom row, and then move right to reach the goal.

I choose to move LEFT to position (0,1).

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,1). Let me plan the path to the goal:

1. Up: not possible (outside maze)
2. Down: not possible (blocked by wall)
3. Left: (0,0) - valid move
4. Right: (0,2) - valid move, but we just came from there and know it doesn't work

I need to get to the bottom row to reach the goal. The only way to do this is to go back to the left side of the maze, go all the way down, and then move right along the bottom row to reach the goal.

I choose to move LEFT to position (0,0).

My next move coordinates are: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,0). Let me execute the plan to reach the goal:

1. Up: not possible (outside maze)
2. Down: (1,0) - valid move
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: (0,1) - valid move, but we just came from there

To reach the goal, I need to:
1. Go down along the left side to the bottom row
2. Then move right along the bottom row to reach the goal

I choose to move DOWN to position (1,0).

My next move coordinates are: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (1,0). Continuing with the plan:

1. Up: (0,0) - valid move, but we just came from there
2. Down: (2,0) - valid move
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: not possible (blocked by wall)

I need to continue moving down along the left side until I reach the bottom row, then I can move right to reach the goal.

I choose to move DOWN to position (2,0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

1. Up: (1,0) - valid move, but we just came from there
2. Down: (3,0) - valid move
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: not possible (blocked by wall)

I need to continue moving down to reach the bottom row, where I can then move right to reach the goal.

I choose to move DOWN to position (3,0).

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

(1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape. The path requires going down one side of the U, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal.

(2) Here's a new maze with a similar U-shaped corridor pattern:

P 0 1 0 G
0 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0

This new maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions
- Forms a U-shaped corridor
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze
- Maintains the U-shape pattern of empty spaces
- Places P and G at opposite ends of the U

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
