You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. There's a wall formation blocking the direct path to the goal
4. We need to go around the walls to reach the goal

Looking at the available moves from position (4,1):
- Up: (3,1) - blocked by wall
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: (4,0) - valid move
- Right: (4,2) - valid move

The best strategy would be to move up and around the wall formation to reach the goal. To do this, we should first move left to (4,0), then work our way up and around.

I choose to move to position (4,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4,0), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We need to go up and around the wall formation

Looking at the available moves from position (4,0):
- Up: (3,0) - valid move
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (4,1) - valid move, but this would be going back

The best path to the goal would be to move upward and then work our way to the right. 

I choose to move to position (3,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3,0), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (3,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We need to continue moving up to get around the wall formation

Looking at the available moves from position (3,0):
- Up: (2,0) - valid move
- Down: (4,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (3,1) - blocked by wall

The best path to the goal would be to continue moving upward until we can move to the right and reach the goal.

I choose to move to position (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2,0), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We need to continue moving up and then find a path to the right

Looking at the available moves from position (2,0):
- Up: (1,0) - valid move
- Down: (3,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (2,1) - blocked by wall

The best path to the goal would be to continue moving upward until we can move to the right and reach the goal.

I choose to move to position (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1,0), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (1,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We can now start moving up and then right to get around the wall formation

Looking at the available moves from position (1,0):
- Up: (0,0) - valid move
- Down: (2,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (1,1) - blocked by wall

The best path to the goal would be to move up to (0,0), which will then allow us to move right and eventually down to the goal.

I choose to move to position (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0

3. We can now move right through the open path

Looking at the available moves from position (0,0):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (0,1) - valid move

The best path to the goal would be to move right, which will allow us to eventually move down to the goal through the open path we can see.

I choose to move to position (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (0,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We should continue moving right to get to the open path that leads to the goal

Looking at the available moves from position (0,1):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,1) - blocked by wall
- Left: (0,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Right: (0,2) - valid move

The best path to the goal would be to continue moving right until we can move down through the open path to reach the goal.

I choose to move to position (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,2), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (0,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We can now move down through the open path that leads toward the goal

Looking at the available moves from position (0,2):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,2) - valid move
- Left: (0,1) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Right: (0,3) - blocked by wall

The best path to the goal would be to move down through the open vertical path, which will eventually allow us to reach the goal.

I choose to move to position (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1,2), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (1,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We should continue moving down through the open path

Looking at the available moves from position (1,2):
- Up: (0,2) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Down: (2,2) - valid move
- Left: (1,1) - blocked by wall
- Right: (1,3) - blocked by wall

The best path to the goal would be to continue moving down through the vertical path, which will eventually allow us to reach the goal.

I choose to move to position (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2,2), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. Moving down is blocked by a wall, so we need to find another way

Looking at the available moves from position (2,2):
- Up: (1,2) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Down: (3,2) - blocked by wall
- Left: (2,1) - blocked by wall
- Right: (2,3) - blocked by wall

I notice that we've reached a dead end. The path downward is blocked, and we can't move right to reach the goal from here. We need to backtrack and find another route.

Let's go back up to explore another potential path.

I choose to move to position (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at position (1,2), let me reassess the situation.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (1,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We discovered that going down leads to a dead end
4. We need to find a path that will let us reach the rightmost column where the goal is

Looking at the available moves from position (1,2):
- Up: (0,2) - valid move
- Down: (2,2) - leads to dead end
- Left: (1,1) - blocked by wall
- Right: (1,3) - blocked by wall

Since we know going down leads to a dead end, and we can't move directly right, let's try going back up to see if we can find a different path to the goal.

I choose to move to position (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at position (0,2), let me reassess the entire maze and our options.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (0,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We've discovered that the vertical path in column 2 leads to a dead end
4. Looking at the maze again, I notice we might be able to reach the goal by going to the rightmost open space in row 0 and then working our way down

Looking at the available moves from position (0,2):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,2) - leads to dead end path
- Left: (0,1) - valid move but not helpful
- Right: (0,4) - valid move through the gap in the wall

Now I see it! We should move to the rightmost column through the gap at the top, then we can work our way down to the goal.

I choose to move to position (0,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

(1) The empty spaces form a general "U" shape. The path requires going up one side of the U, across the top, and down the other side to reach the goal.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size with a U-shaped path:

P 0 1 0 G
0 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0

This new maze:
- Is 5x5 like the original
- Has a U-shaped corridor
- Places P and G at opposite ends of the U
- Uses a different wall arrangement but maintains the U shape
- Requires the same basic strategy: go up one side, across, and down the other side
- Is not identical to the original maze

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: SUCCESS
