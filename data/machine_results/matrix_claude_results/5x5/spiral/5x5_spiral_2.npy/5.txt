You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. There's a wall formation blocking the direct path to the goal
4. I need to find a path around the walls

Looking at the available moves from the current position (4,1):
- Up: (3,1) - blocked by wall
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: (4,0) - valid move
- Right: (4,2) - valid move

The best strategy would be to move up and around the wall formation to reach the goal. To do this, I should first move to the left side of the maze and then work my way up and around.

I choose to move LEFT to position (4,0).

My next move coordinates are: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (4,0). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: (3,0) - valid move
2. Down: not possible (outside maze)
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: (4,1) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from

The best strategy is to move upward along the left side of the maze, which will allow me to eventually reach the goal by going around the wall formation.

I choose to move UP to position (3,0).

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (3,0). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: (2,0) - valid move
2. Down: (4,0) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: (3,1) - blocked by wall

The best strategy is to continue moving upward along the left side of the maze until I can move right towards the goal.

I choose to move UP to position (2,0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (2,0). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: (1,0) - valid move
2. Down: (3,0) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: (2,2) - blocked by wall

The best strategy is to continue moving upward along the left side of the maze until I can move right towards the goal.

I choose to move UP to position (1,0).

My next move coordinates are: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (1,0). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: (0,0) - valid move
2. Down: (2,0) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: (1,2) - blocked by wall

The best strategy is to continue moving upward, and then I'll be able to move right across the top of the maze towards the goal.

I choose to move UP to position (0,0).

My next move coordinates are: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,0). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: not possible (outside maze)
2. Down: (1,0) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: (0,1) - valid move

Now that I've reached the top of the maze, I can start moving right towards the goal. There's a clear path along the top row until the wall at (0,3).

I choose to move RIGHT to position (0,1).

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,1). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: not possible (outside maze)
2. Down: not possible (blocked by wall)
3. Left: (0,0) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
4. Right: (0,2) - valid move

I should continue moving right along the top row until I reach the wall at (0,3).

I choose to move RIGHT to position (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,2). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: not possible (outside maze)
2. Down: (1,2) - valid move
3. Left: (0,1) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
4. Right: (0,3) - blocked by wall

I've reached the point where I can't continue right along the top row due to the wall at (0,3). Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to move down through the middle column to eventually reach the goal.

I choose to move DOWN to position (1,2).

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (1,2). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: (0,2) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
2. Down: (2,2) - valid move
3. Left: not possible (blocked by wall)
4. Right: not possible (blocked by wall)

I should continue moving down through this middle column, which will eventually allow me to reach the bottom row and move right towards the goal.

I choose to move DOWN to position (2,2).

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (2,2). Let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up: (1,2) - valid move, but this would go back where I came from
2. Down: not possible (blocked by wall)
3. Left: not possible (blocked by wall)
4. Right: not possible (blocked by wall)

I notice that I've reached a dead end. The only valid move is back up, and I can see that there's no way to reach the goal through this path. I need to backtrack and find another route.

I choose to move UP to position (1,2).

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (1,2). Let me analyze the situation again:

1. Up: (0,2) - valid move
2. Down: (2,2) - valid move, but I just came from there and found it was a dead end
3. Left: not possible (blocked by wall)
4. Right: not possible (blocked by wall)

I realize now that I need to rethink my strategy. Going down the middle column leads to a dead end. Looking at the maze again, I notice that I need to find a path that will let me reach the goal from the bottom row. The only way to do this would be to go back up, then find a way to reach the bottom row where there aren't walls blocking the path to the goal.

I choose to move UP to position (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,2). Let me completely reassess the situation:

1. Looking at the goal at (3,4), I can only reach it from the bottom row
2. The bottom row is accessible from the left side
3. I need to get back to the left side of the maze and work my way down and then right

Available moves:
1. Up: not possible (outside maze)
2. Down: (1,2) - already know this path leads to dead end
3. Left: (0,1) - valid move
4. Right: not possible (blocked by wall)

I choose to move LEFT to position (0,1) to start making my way back to the left side of the maze.

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,1). Let me continue with the revised strategy:

1. I need to get to the left side of the maze
2. Then work my way down to the bottom row
3. Finally move right to reach the goal

Available moves:
1. Up: not possible (outside maze)
2. Down: not possible (blocked by wall)
3. Left: (0,0) - valid move
4. Right: (0,2) - valid move, but I just came from there

I choose to move LEFT to position (0,0) to continue making my way to the left side of the maze.

My next move coordinates are: (0,0)

P 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,0). Let me execute my strategy:

1. I'm now on the left side of the maze
2. I need to move down to the bottom row
3. Then I can move right to reach the goal

Available moves:
1. Up: not possible (outside maze)
2. Down: (1,0) - valid move
3. Left: not possible (outside maze)
4. Right: (0,1) - valid move, but I just came from there

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
P 0 0 0 0

1) The empty spaces form a general "U" shape. The path requires going up one side, across the top, and then down and around to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size that maintains a "U" shaped corridor but with a different arrangement:

P 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces still form a "U" shape
- There's a valid path from P to G
- The walls are arranged differently but maintain the U-shaped corridor
- The size is 5x5, matching the original
- P and G are placed at opposite ends of the U-shaped path

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: SUCCESS
