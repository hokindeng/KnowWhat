You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. There's a wall formation blocking the direct path to the goal
4. We need to go around the walls to reach the goal

Looking at the available moves from position (4,1):
- Up: (3,1) - blocked by wall
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: (4,0) - valid move
- Right: (4,2) - valid move

The best strategy would be to move up and around the wall formation to reach the goal. To do this, we should first move left to (4,0), then work our way up and around.

I choose to move to position (4,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4,0), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We need to go up and around the wall formation

Looking at the available moves from position (4,0):
- Up: (3,0) - valid move
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (4,1) - valid move, but this would be going back

The best path to the goal will be to go up along the left side of the maze, then move right across the top, and finally down to the goal. Therefore, I should move up.

I choose to move to position (3,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (3,0), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (3,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We need to continue moving up to get around the wall formation

Looking at the available moves from position (3,0):
- Up: (2,0) - valid move
- Down: (4,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: blocked by wall

Continuing with the strategy to go up along the left side, then across the top, and finally down to the goal, I should keep moving up.

I choose to move to position (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2,0), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We need to continue moving up to get around the wall formation

Looking at the available moves from position (2,0):
- Up: (1,0) - valid move
- Down: (3,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: blocked by wall

Continuing with the strategy to go up along the left side, then across the top, and finally down to the goal, I should keep moving up.

I choose to move to position (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
P 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1,0), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (1,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We can now start moving up and then right to get around the wall formation

Looking at the available moves from position (1,0):
- Up: (0,0) - valid move
- Down: (2,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: blocked by wall

Following our strategy to go up and then across the top of the maze, I should move up one more time.

I choose to move to position (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,0), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (0,0)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We've reached the top of the maze and can now move right

Looking at the available moves from position (0,0):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (0,1) - valid move

Now that we've reached the top, we can start moving right across the top of the maze until we reach the wall, then we'll need to move down to reach the goal.

I choose to move to position (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,1), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (0,1)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We should continue moving right along the top of the maze

Looking at the available moves from position (0,1):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: (0,0) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Right: (0,2) - valid move

Continuing with our strategy to move across the top of the maze and then down to the goal, we should keep moving right.

I choose to move to position (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,2), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (0,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We've reached a point where we can start moving down

Looking at the available moves from position (0,2):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,2) - valid move
- Left: (0,1) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Right: blocked by wall

Since we can't move right anymore due to the wall, and we need to get to the goal which is below and to the right, we should start moving down through the open corridor.

I choose to move to position (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (1,2), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (1,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. We should continue moving down through this corridor

Looking at the available moves from position (1,2):
- Up: (0,2) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Down: (2,2) - valid move
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall

We need to continue moving down through this corridor to get closer to the goal position.

I choose to move to position (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (2,2), let me analyze the next best move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (2,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. Moving down is blocked by a wall, so we need to move right to reach the goal

Looking at the available moves from position (2,2):
- Up: (1,2) - valid move but would be going backwards
- Down: blocked by wall
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall

I notice that I've reached a dead end. I can't move down or right due to walls, and moving up would just backtrack. This appears to be an error in my previous strategy - there is no valid path to the goal through this corridor.

Let me reconsider: I need to go back up and find another path. 

I choose to move to position (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at position (1,2), let me analyze the situation again.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (1,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. I realize now we need to find a different path to the goal

Looking at the available moves from position (1,2):
- Up: (0,2) - valid move
- Down: (2,2) - valid move but we know it leads to a dead end
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall

Since going down leads to a dead end, and we need to find a different path, let's go back up to explore other possibilities. From the top, we might be able to find a different route to the goal.

I choose to move to position (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm back at position (0,2), let me analyze the situation again with fresh eyes.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (0,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3,4)
3. Looking at the maze more carefully now, I notice there's a path through the right side

Looking at the available moves from position (0,2):
- Up: not possible (outside maze)
- Down: (1,2) - leads to dead end as we discovered
- Left: (0,1) - valid move but would be backtracking
- Right: blocked by wall

I now see that we need to find a completely different route. The path I was trying before through the middle corridor doesn't work. Looking at the maze again, I notice we can actually reach the goal by going around the right side of the maze.

Let's go back to the bottom and try a different approach. 

I choose to move to position (0,3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 P 0 0 0

(1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape. The path requires going up the left side, across the top, and down the right side to reach the goal.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size with a "U" shaped path:

0 P 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
1 1 0 0 0

This new maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions
- Maintains a "U" shaped corridor
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original (added walls at bottom left)
- The empty spaces still form a recognizable "U" shape that requires the same general movement pattern: going up one side, across the top, and down the other side to reach the goal

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: SUCCESS
