You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

Current position 'P' is at (0,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,3)

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach the goal, I need to:
1. Go down through the empty spaces on the left side
2. Move right through the bottom row
3. Go up to reach the goal

For my first move, I need to go left to avoid the wall below.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,2), which is one space to the left of the current position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue with my plan to navigate around the walls to reach the goal.

Current position 'P' is at (0,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,3)

Following my strategy to:
1. Go down through the empty spaces on the left side
2. Move right through the bottom row
3. Go up to reach the goal

I choose to move to coordinates (0,1), which is one space to the left of the current position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

(1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape. The path requires going down the left side, across the bottom, and up the right side to reach the goal.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size with a "U" shaped corridor:

P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

This new maze:
- Is 5x5 like the original
- Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original
- Maintains a "U" shape formed by the empty spaces
- The path still requires going down, across, and up to reach the goal

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
