You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

Current position 'P' is at (0,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,3)

Looking at the maze, I need to find a path from P to G while avoiding walls (1's). I can see that I can't go right due to a wall, and going down is blocked by a wall. The best path would be to:
1. Go left first to avoid the walls
2. Then go down
3. Then right to reach the goal

For my first move, I'll go left, moving from (0,3) to (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (0,2)
- The goal 'G' is still at (2,3)

Following my planned path:
1. I need to continue moving left to get around the walls
2. Then I'll go down
3. Finally, I'll move right to reach the goal

For my next move, I'll continue moving left, from (0,2) to (0,1).

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (0,1)
- The goal 'G' is still at (2,3)

Following my planned path:
1. I'll move left one more time to reach the leftmost column
2. Then I can safely move down along the left side
3. Eventually, I'll move right to reach the goal

For my next move, I'll move left one more time, from (0,1) to (0,0).

My next move coordinates are: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (0,0)
- The goal 'G' is still at (2,3)

Now that I'm at the leftmost column, I can safely move down along this path until I reach the bottom, then move right towards the goal.

For my next move, I'll move down from (0,0) to (1,0).

My next move coordinates are: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (1,0)
- The goal 'G' is still at (2,3)

Continuing with my plan:
1. I'll keep moving down along the leftmost column
2. Then I'll move right towards the goal

For my next move, I'll move down from (1,0) to (2,0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (2,0)
- The goal 'G' is still at (2,3)

Continuing with my plan:
1. I'll move down one more time to get past all the walls
2. Then I can move right along the bottom path to reach the goal

For my next move, I'll move down from (2,0) to (3,0).

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (3,0)
- The goal 'G' is still at (2,3)

Now I'll move down one more time to reach the bottom row, where I'll have a clear path to move right and then up to reach the goal.

For my next move, I'll move down from (3,0) to (4,0).

My next move coordinates are: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (4,0)
- The goal 'G' is still at (2,3)

Now that I'm in the bottom row, I can start moving right towards the position under the goal, and then I'll move up to reach it.

For my next move, I'll move right from (4,0) to (4,1).

My next move coordinates are: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze:
- I am now at position (4,1)
- The goal 'G' is still at (2,3)

Continuing along the bottom row towards the position under the goal.

For my next move, I'll move right from (4,1) to (4,2).

My next move coordinates are: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1

Continuing along the bottom row until I'm directly under the goal position.

For my next move, I'll move right from (4,2) to (4,3).

My next move coordinates are: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1

Now that I'm directly under the goal's column, I can start moving up. I'll move up from (4,3) to (3,3).

My next move coordinates are: (3,3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:
```
0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 G 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

1. The empty spaces in this maze form a "U" shape. The path requires going left from the start, down along the left side, and then right and up to reach the goal.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size that also forms a U shape but with a different arrangement:
```
0 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 0 0
1 0 1 G 0
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0
```

In this new maze:
- The U shape is still preserved
- P and G positions create a valid path through empty spaces
- The walls are arranged differently but still force a U-shaped path
- The maze has the same 5x5 dimensions as the original
- The solution would require moving left, down, right, and up, similar to the original maze
