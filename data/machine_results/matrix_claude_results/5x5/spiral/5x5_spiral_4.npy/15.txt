You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

Current position 'P' is at (1,0)
Goal position 'G' is at (4,0)

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach the goal, I need to:
1. Move up to avoid the wall to my right
2. Move through the empty spaces to eventually reach 'G'

For my first move, I'll move UP from (1,0) to (0,0).

My next move coordinates are: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0,0), I can see that I need to move right through the empty spaces at the top of the maze, and then work my way down to the goal.

I'll move RIGHT from (0,0) to (0,1).

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing along the top row to get to a position where I can move down towards the goal.

I'll move RIGHT from (0,1) to (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing along the top row to get to the rightmost position before I can start moving down.

I'll move RIGHT from (0,2) to (0,3).

My next move coordinates are: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0,3), I'll move RIGHT one more time to (0,4), which will put me in position to start moving down through the empty spaces on the right side of the maze.

My next move coordinates are: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0,4), I can start moving DOWN through the empty spaces on the right side of the maze.

I'll move DOWN from (0,4) to (1,4).

My next move coordinates are: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 P
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing DOWN through the empty spaces on the right side of the maze.

I'll move DOWN from (1,4) to (2,4).

My next move coordinates are: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 P
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing DOWN through the empty spaces on the right side of the maze.

I'll move DOWN from (2,4) to (3,4).

My next move coordinates are: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 P
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (3,4), I'll move DOWN one more time to (4,4), which will put me in position to move left towards the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (4,4), I can start moving LEFT through the empty spaces at the bottom of the maze towards the goal.

I'll move LEFT from (4,4) to (4,3).

My next move coordinates are: (4,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at (4,2) and I can see the goal 'G' just two spaces to the left. I'll move LEFT to get closer to the goal.

I'll move LEFT from (4,2) to (4,1).

My next move coordinates are: (4,1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, I can observe that:

1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape, with corridors running along the top, right side, and bottom of the maze.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (5x5) that also forms a U-shape pattern, but with a slightly different arrangement:

P 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 0 0
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions (5x5)
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms a U-shape with corridors along the top, right side, and bottom
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape pattern
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for start, G for goal)
