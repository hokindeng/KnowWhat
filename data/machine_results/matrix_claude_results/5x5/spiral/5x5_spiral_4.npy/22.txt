You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

Current position 'P' is at (1,0)
Goal position 'G' is at (4,0)

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach the goal, I need to:
1. Move up to avoid the wall to my right
2. Move through the empty spaces to eventually reach 'G'

For my first move, I'll move UP from (1,0) to (0,0).

My next move coordinates are: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now I'm at position (0,0) and need to continue towards the goal at (4,0).

Looking at the maze, I can see that I need to:
1. Move right through the empty spaces at the top
2. Then move down on the right side of the maze
3. Finally move left to reach 'G'

From my current position (0,0), I'll move RIGHT to (0,1).

My next move coordinates are: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,1) and continuing towards the goal at (4,0).

Following the path I identified:
1. Continue moving right along the top row
2. Then I'll be able to move down the right side
3. Finally move left to reach 'G'

From my current position (0,1), I'll move RIGHT to (0,2).

My next move coordinates are: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 P 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,2) and continuing towards the goal at (4,0).

Following the same strategy:
1. Continue moving right along the top row
2. Then move down the right side
3. Finally move left to reach 'G'

From my current position (0,2), I'll move RIGHT to (0,3).

My next move coordinates are: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 P 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,3) and continuing towards the goal at (4,0).

Following the path:
1. Move right one more time to reach the rightmost column
2. Then I can move down along the right side of the maze
3. Finally move left to reach 'G'

From my current position (0,3), I'll move RIGHT to (0,4).

My next move coordinates are: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 P
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (0,4) and continuing towards the goal at (4,0).

Now that I'm in the rightmost column:
1. I'll start moving down along the right side
2. Once I reach the bottom, I can move left to reach 'G'

From my current position (0,4), I'll move DOWN to (1,4).

My next move coordinates are: (1,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 P
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (1,4) and continuing towards the goal at (4,0).

Continuing with the plan:
1. Keep moving down along the right side
2. Then move left at the bottom to reach 'G'

From my current position (1,4), I'll move DOWN to (2,4).

My next move coordinates are: (2,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 P
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (2,4) and continuing towards the goal at (4,0).

Continuing with the plan:
1. Keep moving down along the right side
2. Then move left at the bottom to reach 'G'

From my current position (2,4), I'll move DOWN to (3,4).

My next move coordinates are: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 P
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (3,4) and continuing towards the goal at (4,0).

Now I can:
1. Move down one more time to reach the bottom row
2. Then move left through the empty spaces to reach 'G'

From my current position (3,4), I'll move DOWN to (4,4).

My next move coordinates are: (4,4)

G 1 0 0 P

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (4,4) and close to the goal at (4,0).

Now that I'm in the bottom row:
1. I can move left through the empty spaces to reach 'G'

From my current position (4,4), I'll move LEFT to (4,3).

My next move coordinates are: (4,3)

0 1 0 1 0
G 1 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (4,2) and very close to the goal at (4,0).

I can see the goal 'G' just two spaces to my left, but there's a wall at (4,1) blocking the direct path.
1. I need to move left to (4,0) to reach 'G', but I must first move around the wall at (4,1)

From my current position (4,2), I'll move UP to (3,2) to start going around the wall.

G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (3,2) and working my way around to reach the goal at (4,0).

To reach the goal:
1. I need to move up one more space
2. Then move left to get around the wall
3. Finally move down to reach 'G'

From my current position (3,2), I'll move UP to (2,2).

From my current position (2,2), I'll move LEFT to (2,1).

My next move coordinates are: (2,1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape. The path goes from the top, down one side, and back up the other side.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with a "U" shaped path:

0 1 1 1 0
P 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 0
G 1 1 1 0

This new maze:
- Is 5x5 like the original
- Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original
- Maintains a "U" shape in its corridors
- The path goes down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side
