You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

Current position 'P' is at (1,0)
Goal position 'G' is at (4,0)

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach the goal, I need to:
1. Move up to (0,0)
2. Move right to the open path
3. Move down along the right side
4. Move left to reach 'G'

For my first move, I'll move UP from (1,0) to (0,0).

My next move coordinates are: (0,0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze, the empty spaces form a "U" shape - starting from the top row, going down the right side, and then connecting to the goal on the left.

Here's my new maze design that maintains a "U" shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 G

This maze:
1. Is 5x5 like the original
2. Has a valid path from P to G
3. Is different from the original maze
4. Maintains a "U" shape pattern of empty spaces, but inverted compared to the original (starts at top left, goes down the left side, and connects to the goal on the right)

The path follows the "U" shape: from P at the top left, down the left side of the maze, across the bottom, and up to G in the top right.
