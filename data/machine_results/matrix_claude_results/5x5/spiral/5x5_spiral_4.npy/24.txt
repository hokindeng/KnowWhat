You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

Current position 'P' is at (1,0)
Goal position 'G' is at (4,0)

Looking at the maze, I can see that to reach the goal, I need to:
1. Move up to (0,0)
2. Move right to the open path
3. Move down along the right side
4. Move left to reach 'G'

For my first move, I'll move UP from (1,0) to (0,0).

My next move coordinates are: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0

Following my plan:
1. ✓ Moved up to (0,0)
2. Next, I need to move right to create a path to eventually reach the bottom

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
G 1 P 0 0

1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape. The path goes from the top, down one side, and back up the other side.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with a "U" shaped corridor pattern:

P 0 0 0 G
1 1 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0

This new maze:
- Is 5x5 like the original
- Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original maze
- Maintains a "U" shaped corridor pattern
- The path goes down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach G
