You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

Current observations:
- Player (P) is at position (4,1)
- Goal (G) is at position (0,1)
- There's a clear path along the left side of the maze (column 0)

The optimal solution would be to move upward along the leftmost column until we can reach the goal.

For my next move, I want to move up from position (4,1) to (3,1), so first I need to move to (4,0).

I choose to move to coordinate (4,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4,0), I can continue with my plan to move upward along the leftmost column to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (3,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving up along the leftmost column towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving up along the leftmost column towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving up along the leftmost column towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at (0,0), I can make the final move to reach the goal at (0,1).

I choose to move to coordinate (0,1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) In the original maze, the empty spaces form an "L" shape, with one corridor running vertically along the left side and another corridor running horizontally along the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement:

P 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 G
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0

This maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions as the original
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is not identical to the original maze
- Maintains an "L" shape formed by its corridors (vertical corridor on the left, horizontal corridor at the bottom, meeting at the corner)
- Places P and G in different positions but still ensures they're connected via the L-shaped path
