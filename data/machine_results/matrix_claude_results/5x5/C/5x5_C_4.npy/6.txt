You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

Current observations:
- Player (P) is at position (4,1)
- Goal (G) is at position (0,1)
- There's a clear path along the left side of the maze (column 0)

The optimal solution would be to move upward along the leftmost column until we can reach the goal.

For my next move, I want to move up from position (4,1) to (3,1), so I'll first need to move left to (4,0).

I choose to move to coordinates: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (4,0), I can continue with my plan to move upward along the leftmost column to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving upward along the leftmost column.

I choose to move to coordinates: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving upward along the leftmost column.

I choose to move to coordinates: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 G 0 0 0
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving upward along the leftmost column to reach the top row, and then I can move right to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (0,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P G 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that I'm at position (0,0), I can make the final move right to reach the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates: (0,1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) The empty spaces in the original maze form an "L" shape, with one corridor running along the left side (vertically) and another along the bottom (horizontally).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement:

P 1 1 1 G
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0

This new maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G (going down, right along the bottom, and then up)
- Is not identical to the original (P and G positions are different)
- Maintains the "L" shape formed by the empty spaces
- Uses the same encoding (0 for empty spaces, 1 for walls, P for player, G for goal)
