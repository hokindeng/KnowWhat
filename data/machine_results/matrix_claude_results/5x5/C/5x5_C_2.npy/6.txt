You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (4,1)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (4,3)
3. I need to move through empty spaces ('0') to reach the goal

Looking at the available moves from position (4,1):
- Up is possible through empty space
- Right is possible through empty space
- Left and down are blocked by walls

Since the goal is to the right of the current position, and there's a clear path to it, I'll move right.

I choose to move to coordinate (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 P G 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm now at position (4,2) and the goal 'G' is right next to me at (4,3).

Since there's a clear path to the goal and it's directly to my right, I'll move right to reach it.

I choose to move to coordinate (4,3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 0

(1) The empty spaces form an "L" shape, with one corridor going up vertically and another extending to the right horizontally at the bottom.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces also forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is not identical to the original
- Maintains an "L" shape formed by the corridors
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
