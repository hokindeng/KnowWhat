You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

Current position 'P' is at (3,1)
Goal position 'G' is at (1,3)

Looking at the maze:
- I can move up to (2,1) or down to (4,1)
- Moving up leads to a dead end due to the wall at (2,2)
- Moving down to (4,1) gives access to a path that can lead to the goal

For my next move, I choose to move down to coordinate (4,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 0 0 1

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

(1) The empty spaces form an "L" shape, with one corridor going down the left side and another corridor along the bottom.

(2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement while maintaining a valid path from P to G:

1 1 1 1 1
1 G 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is not identical to the original
- Maintains an "L" shape formed by the empty spaces
- Places P and G in different positions but still allows them to be connected via the L-shaped corridor
