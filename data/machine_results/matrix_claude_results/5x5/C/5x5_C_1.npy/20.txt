You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution:

Current position 'P' is at (3,1)
Goal position 'G' is at (1,3)
I need to reach the goal by moving through empty spaces ('0')

Looking at the maze:
- I can't move right (wall)
- I can move up (empty space)
- I can't move left (wall)
- I can move down (empty space)

To reach the goal, I need to:
1. Move up to access the path leading to 'G'
2. Then move right towards the goal

Therefore, for my first move, I choose to move UP from (3,1) to (2,1).

My next move coordinates are: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan my next move:

Current position 'P' is at (2,1)
Goal position 'G' is at (1,3)

Looking at my options:
- I can't move right (wall)
- I can move up (empty space)
- I can't move left (wall)
- I can move down (empty space)

To reach the goal, I need to:
1. Move up to get to the row where the goal is
2. Then move right towards the goal

Therefore, I choose to move UP from (2,1) to (1,1).

My next move coordinates are: (1,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan my next move:

Current position 'P' is at (1,1)
Goal position 'G' is at (1,3)

Looking at my options:
- I can move right (empty space)
- I can't move up (wall)
- I can't move left (wall)
- I can move down (empty space)

Since I'm now on the same row as the goal, and there's an empty path to it, I should move RIGHT from (1,1) to (1,2) to get closer to the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (1,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 0 P G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan my next move:

Current position 'P' is at (1,2)
Goal position 'G' is at (1,3)

Looking at my options:
- I can move right (to the goal)
- I can't move up (wall)
- I can move left (empty space)
- I can't move down (wall)

I'm right next to the goal! I should move RIGHT from (1,2) to (1,3) to reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (1,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 G 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

1) The empty spaces form an "L" shape (or inverted "L" shape, depending on orientation).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an "L" shape:
1 1 1 1 1
1 P 1 1 1
1 0 1 1 1
1 0 G 1 1
1 0 0 0 1

This new maze:
- Is 5x5 like the original
- Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is not identical to the original
- Maintains an "L" shape in its corridors
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
