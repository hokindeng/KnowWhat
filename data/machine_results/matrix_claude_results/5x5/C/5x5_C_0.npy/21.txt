You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

0 0 P 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal 'G'.

Current observations:
- Player 'P' is at position (0,2)
- Goal 'G' is at position (3,0)
- There's a clear path along the left side of the maze

To reach the goal, I need to move left and then down. The first move should be to the left.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,1), which is one step to the left of the current position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 P 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving towards the goal 'G'.

Current observations:
- Player 'P' is now at position (0,1)
- Goal 'G' is at position (3,0)
- I need to continue moving left and then down along the clear path

I choose to move to coordinates (0,0), which is one step to the left of the current position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

P 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving towards the goal 'G'.

Current observations:
- Player 'P' is now at position (0,0)
- Goal 'G' is at position (3,0)
- I can move straight down along the left edge to reach the goal

I choose to move to coordinates (1,0), which is one step down from the current position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
P 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving towards the goal 'G'.

Current observations:
- Player 'P' is now at position (1,0)
- Goal 'G' is at position (3,0)
- I need to continue moving down along the left edge

I choose to move to coordinates (2,0), which is one step down from the current position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
P 1 1 1 1
G 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll make the final move to reach the goal 'G'.

Current observations:
- Player 'P' is now at position (2,0)
- Goal 'G' is at position (3,0)
- Just one more step down to reach the goal

I choose to move to coordinates (3,0), which is one step down from the current position, reaching the goal 'G'.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) In the original maze, the empty spaces (corridors) form an "L" shape, with one corridor running along the top row and another running down the left side.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (5x5) that maintains an "L" shape pattern but is not identical to the original:

P 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 G
1 1 1 1 0

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise compared to the original
- The path runs from left to right along the top row, then down the rightmost column
- 'P' is placed at the start of the L (top-left)
- 'G' is placed near the end of the L (bottom-right)
- The walls (1's) fill the interior space
- The maze maintains valid pathfinding properties from P to G
