You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 P 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is at position (4,3)
2. The goal (G) is at position (2,4)
3. There are empty spaces (0) around the player position

From the player's current position (4,3), we can move:
- Up to (3,3) - but this is blocked by a wall (1)
- Left to (4,2) - this is a valid move through an empty space
- Right to (4,4) - this is a valid move through an empty space
- Down is not possible as it would be outside the maze

To reach the goal (G), we need to move upward eventually. The best path would be to first move left to (4,2), then up through the empty corridor, and finally right to reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to position (4,2).

My next move coordinates are: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 P 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current maze state.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (4,2)
2. The goal (G) is still at position (2,4)
3. Looking at the available moves from current position

From the player's current position (4,2), we can move:
- Up to (3,2) - this is a valid move through an empty space
- Right to (4,3) - this would be going back to where we came from
- Left is blocked by a wall
- Down is not possible as it would be outside the maze

To reach the goal (G), we need to move upward through the corridor and then right. The best next move is to move up to position (3,2).

Therefore, I choose to move to position (3,2).

My next move coordinates are: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 P 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current maze state.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (3,2)
2. The goal (G) is still at position (2,4)
3. Looking at the available moves from current position

From the player's current position (3,2), we can move:
- Up to (2,2) - this is a valid move through an empty space
- Down to (4,2) - this would be going back to where we came from
- Left is blocked by a wall
- Right is blocked by a wall

To reach the goal (G), we need to continue moving up and then right through the corridor. The only logical move is to move up to position (2,2).

Therefore, I choose to move to position (2,2).

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current maze state.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (2,4)
3. Looking at the available moves from current position

From the player's current position (2,2), we can move:
- Right to (2,3) - this is a valid move through an empty space
- Down to (3,2) - this would be going back to where we came from
- Left is blocked by a wall
- Up is blocked by a wall

To reach the goal (G), we need to move right through the corridor. The only logical move is to move right to position (2,3).

Therefore, I choose to move to position (2,3).

My next move coordinates are: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 P G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 0

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current maze state.

Current observations:
1. The player (P) is now at position (2,3)
2. The goal (G) is at position (2,4) - right next to us!
3. Looking at the available moves from current position

From the player's current position (2,3), we can move:
- Right to (2,4) - this leads directly to the goal
- Left to (2,2) - this would be going back to where we came from
- Up is blocked by a wall
- Down is blocked by a wall

We're right next to the goal, so the obvious move is to move right to reach it.

Therefore, I choose to move to position (2,4).

My next move coordinates are: (2,4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 G
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 0 P 0

(1) The empty spaces in this maze form an "L" shape (or inverted "L" shape, depending on orientation).

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 G
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 1 1 0
1 1 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces still form an "L" shape
- There is a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- The maze is different from the original
- The dimensions are the same (5x5)
- The "L" shape is rotated compared to the original, but still clearly recognizable as an "L"

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
