You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The maze is 5x5
2. Player (P) is at position (2,3)
3. Goal (G) is at position (0,3)
4. There is a path of empty spaces (0s) connecting P to G
5. We need to move left to reach the goal

Given these observations, I recommend moving left to position (2,2).

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

This will get us closer to the goal while staying on the available path.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:
1. Player (P) is now at position (2,2)
2. Goal (G) is still at position (0,3)
3. To reach the goal, we need to move left and then up

I recommend moving left to position (2,1).

My next move coordinates are: (2,1)

This will continue our path toward the goal while staying on available empty spaces.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:
1. Player (P) is now at position (2,1)
2. Goal (G) is still at position (0,3)
3. To reach the goal, we need to move left one more time

I recommend moving left to position (2,0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

This will get us to the leftmost column, from where we can then move down to reach the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:
1. Player (P) is now at position (2,0)
2. Goal (G) is at position (0,3)
3. We're in the leftmost column
4. We can move down to reach the goal

I recommend moving down to position (3,0).

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

This will put us at the same position as the goal (G), completing the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

(1) The empty spaces form an "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation)

(2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming an "L" shape:

1 1 1 G 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 P 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Is 5x5 like the original
- Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is not identical to the original
- Forms an "L" shape with its corridors
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
