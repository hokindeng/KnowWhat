You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The maze is 5x5
2. Player (P) is at position (2,3)
3. Goal (G) is at position (0,3)
4. There is a path of empty spaces (0s) connecting P to G
5. We need to move left to reach the goal

Given these observations, I recommend moving left to position (2,2).

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

This will get us closer to the goal while staying on the available path.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:
1. Player (P) is now at position (2,2)
2. Goal (G) is still at position (0,3)
3. We need to continue moving left to reach the goal

I recommend moving left to position (2,1).

My next move coordinates are: (2,1)

This will get us one step closer to being able to reach the goal position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:
1. Player (P) is now at position (2,1)
2. Goal (G) is still at position (0,3)
3. We need to continue moving left to reach the goal, and then down

I recommend moving left to position (2,0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

This will put us in position to make the final move to the goal in the next turn.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:
1. Player (P) is now at position (2,0)
2. Goal (G) is at position (0,3)
3. We can now move down to reach the goal

I recommend moving down to position (3,0), which is where the goal (G) is located.

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

This will complete the path to the goal!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

(1) The empty spaces form a general "U" shape.

(2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with a U-shaped corridor that maintains the same general shape but with a different arrangement:

1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
P 0 0 1 1
1 G 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions
- Contains a U-shaped path of empty spaces
- Has different positions for P and G
- Provides a valid path between P and G
- Is not identical to the original maze
- Maintains the recognizable U-shape pattern in its corridors
