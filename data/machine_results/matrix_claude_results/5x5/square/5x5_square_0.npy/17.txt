You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The maze is 5x5
2. Player (P) is at position (2,3)
3. Goal (G) is at position (0,3)
4. There is a path of empty spaces (0s) connecting P to G
5. We need to move left to reach the goal

Given these observations, I recommend moving left to position (2,2).

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

This will get us closer to the goal while staying on the available path.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:
1. Player (P) is now at position (2,2)
2. Goal (G) is still at position (0,3)
3. We need to continue moving left to reach the goal

I recommend moving left to position (2,1).

My next move coordinates are: (2,1)

This will get us one step closer to being able to reach the goal position.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:
1. Player (P) is now at position (2,1)
2. Goal (G) is still at position (0,3)
3. We need to continue moving left to reach the goal, and then down

I recommend moving left to position (2,0).

My next move coordinates are: (2,0)

This will position us directly above the path to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:
1. Player (P) is now at position (2,0)
2. Goal (G) is at position (0,3)
3. We can now move down to reach the goal

I recommend moving down to position (3,0).

My next move coordinates are: (3,0)

This will put us at the goal position (G).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a general "U" shape, with the vertical parts of the U on the left side and middle of the maze, and the horizontal part connecting them at the bottom.

2. Here's a new 5x5 maze that maintains a "U" shape pattern of empty spaces but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 1 1
1 P 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 G 1 1
1 0 0 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms a U-shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze (the U is rotated 90 degrees clockwise compared to the original)
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
