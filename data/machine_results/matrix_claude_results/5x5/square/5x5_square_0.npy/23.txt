You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The maze is 5x5
2. Player (P) is at position (2,3)
3. Goal (G) is at position (0,3)
4. There are empty spaces (0) forming a path around the wall
5. To reach the goal, I need to go left through the empty spaces

The best next move would be to move left to coordinates (2,2), which is an empty space that will help me get closer to the goal.

I choose coordinates: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. Player (P) is now at position (2,2)
2. Goal (G) is still at position (0,3)
3. I need to continue moving left and then down to reach the goal

The best next move would be to move left again to coordinates (2,1), continuing along the path of empty spaces that will eventually lead to the goal.

I choose coordinates: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. Player (P) is now at position (2,1)
2. Goal (G) is still at position (0,3)
3. I need to continue moving left and then down to reach the goal

The best next move would be to move left again to coordinates (2,0), which will allow me to then move down towards the goal.

I choose coordinates: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. Player (P) is now at position (2,0)
2. Goal (G) is at position (0,3)
3. I'm now in position to move down towards the goal

The best next move would be to move down to coordinates (3,0), which will put me right next to the goal position.

I choose coordinates: (3,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

(1) The empty spaces form a general "U" shape, with the two vertical segments connected by a horizontal segment at the bottom.

(2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with a "U" shaped corridor that maintains the same general shape but with slightly different dimensions:

1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 1 P 1 1
0 1 G 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Forms a "U" shape with its corridors
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
