You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1 1
G 1 P 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Current observations:
1. The maze is 5x5
2. Player (P) is at position (2,3)
3. Goal (G) is at position (0,3)
4. There are empty spaces (0) forming a path around the wall
5. To reach the goal, I need to go left through the empty spaces

The best next move would be to move left to coordinates (2,2), which is an empty space that will help me get closer to the goal.

I choose coordinates: (2,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 P 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:
1. Player (P) is now at position (2,2)
2. Goal (G) is still at position (0,3)
3. I need to continue moving towards the goal by going around the wall

To reach the goal, I need to move left again to coordinates (2,1).

I choose coordinates: (2,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 P 0 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:
1. Player (P) is now at position (2,1)
2. Goal (G) is still at position (0,3)
3. I need to continue moving towards the goal by going around the wall

To reach the goal, I need to move left again to coordinates (2,0).

I choose coordinates: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
P 0 0 1 1
G 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current maze state:
1. Player (P) is now at position (2,0)
2. Goal (G) is still at position (0,3)
3. I need to continue moving towards the goal

From here, I need to move down to get closer to the goal position.

I choose coordinates: (3,0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape, with the vertical parts of the U on the left side and middle of the maze, and the horizontal part at the bottom.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming a U shape, but with a different arrangement than the original:

1 1 P 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 G
0 0 0 0 0

This maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is not identical to the original
- Forms a U shape with its corridors (one vertical part down the middle, connecting to a horizontal part at the bottom, connecting to another vertical part on the right)
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)
