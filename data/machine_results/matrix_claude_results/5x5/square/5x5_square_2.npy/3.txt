You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 P 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,2)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (0,2)
3. Looking at possible moves from current position:
   - Up: (2,2) - blocked by wall
   - Down: (4,2) - blocked by wall
   - Left: (3,1) - empty space
   - Right: (3,3) - empty space

To reach the goal at (0,2), I need to move up through the empty path on the left side of the maze. Therefore, I should first move left.

I choose to move to coordinates (3,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (3,1)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (0,2)
3. Possible moves from current position:
   - Up: (2,1) - empty space
   - Down: (4,1) - blocked by wall
   - Left: (3,0) - blocked by wall
   - Right: (3,2) - empty space

To reach the goal, I need to move upward through the empty path. 

I choose to move to coordinates (2,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (2,1)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (0,2)
3. Possible moves from current position:
   - Up: (1,1) - empty space
   - Down: (3,1) - empty space
   - Left: (2,0) - blocked by wall
   - Right: (2,2) - blocked by wall

To reach the goal, I need to continue moving upward through the empty path.

I choose to move to coordinates (1,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 0 G 0 0
1 P 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (1,1)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (0,2)
3. Possible moves from current position:
   - Up: (0,1) - empty space
   - Down: (2,1) - empty space
   - Left: (1,0) - blocked by wall
   - Right: (1,2) - blocked by wall

To reach the goal, I need to move up and then right to reach the goal position.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 P G 0 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the current state:

1. Current position 'P' is at (0,1)
2. Goal position 'G' is at (0,2)
3. Possible moves from current position:
   - Up: not possible (out of bounds)
   - Down: (1,1) - empty space
   - Left: (0,0) - blocked by wall
   - Right: (0,2) - this is the goal position!

I can now reach the goal by moving right.

I choose to move to coordinates (0,2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form an "L" shape (or inverted "L" shape, depending on orientation).

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 P 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 1 1 0 1
G 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Has the same 5x5 dimensions
- Contains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is not identical to the original maze
- Forms an "L" shape with its corridors
- Uses the same encoding (1 for walls, 0 for empty spaces, P for player, G for goal)

The L-shape in this new maze is rotated 90 degrees compared to the original, but it maintains the characteristic L-shape pattern of connected corridors.
