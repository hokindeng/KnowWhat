You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position, and a goal position. The maze has the following encoding:
* Walls are represented by a '1'
* Empty spaces are represented by a '0'
* The current player position is represented by 'P'
* The goal position is represented by 'G'
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

1 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 G 0 P
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal 'G'.

Current position 'P' is at (2,4)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,2)

To reach the goal, I need to move left through the empty spaces. The shortest path would be to move left until I reach 'G'.

For my next move, I'll move one step left from (2,4) to (2,3).

My next move coordinates are: (2,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

1 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 G P 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving left towards the goal 'G'.

Current position 'P' is at (2,3)
Goal position 'G' is at (2,2)

I'll move one more step left from (2,3) to (2,2) to reach the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (2,2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the original maze:

1 1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1 0
1 1 G P 0
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

(1) The empty spaces form a general "L" shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise from a standard L).

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a similar rotated "L" shape, but with a different arrangement:

1 1 1 0 0
1 1 1 0 0
1 1 P 0 G
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

This new maze:
- Is 5x5 like the original
- Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is not identical to the original
- Maintains the rotated "L" shape of the corridors
- Places P and G in positions that require traversing the L-shaped path to reach the goal
