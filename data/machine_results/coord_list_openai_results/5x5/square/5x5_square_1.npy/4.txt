You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (1, 3) to the goal position (0, 1) while avoiding walls and only moving through empty spaces. Let's use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path.

Here is the initial setup:
- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
- Player position: (1, 3)
- Goal: (0, 1)

We will start from the player position and explore all possible moves until we reach the goal. The possible moves are up, down, left, and right.

Let's perform the BFS algorithm:

1. Initialize the queue with the starting position (1, 3) and an empty set for visited nodes.
2. Dequeue the current position and check if it is the goal.
3. If it is not the goal, enqueue all valid adjacent positions (empty spaces that have not been visited and are not walls).
4. Repeat until the goal is found.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Start at (1, 3).
2. Possible moves from (1, 3):
   - Up: (0, 3) (valid move)
   - Down: (2, 3) (valid move)
   - Left: (1, 2) (invalid move, wall)
   - Right: (1, 4) (invalid move, wall)

Next move: (0, 3)

Please update the maze with the new player position (0, 3) and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current player position (0, 3) and the goal position (0, 1), let's determine the next move using the same BFS approach.

Possible moves from (0, 3):
- Up: (invalid move, out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 3) (valid move)
- Left: (0, 2) (valid move)
- Right: (0, 4) (invalid move, wall)

Next move: (0, 2)

Please update the maze with the new player position (0, 2) and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current player position (0, 2) and the goal position (0, 1), let's determine the next move.

Possible moves from (0, 2):
- Up: (invalid move, out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 2) (invalid move, wall)
- Left: (0, 1) (valid move, goal position)
- Right: (0, 3) (valid move)

Next move: (0, 1)

Please update the maze with the new player position (0, 1) and confirm that the goal has been reached.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "T" shape.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with empty spaces that form a "T" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 1)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)

This new maze maintains the "T" shape formed by the empty spaces and includes a valid path from the player position (1, 3) to the goal position (0, 2).
