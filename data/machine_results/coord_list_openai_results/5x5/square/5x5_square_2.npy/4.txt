You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (3, 2) to the goal position (0, 2) while avoiding walls and only moving through empty spaces. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path.

Here is the step-by-step process to find the next move:

1. Initialize the BFS queue with the current player position and an empty path.
2. Use a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.
3. For each position, check the possible moves (up, down, left, right).
4. If a move leads to the goal, return the path including that move.
5. If a move leads to an empty space and hasn't been visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.

Let's start with the initial position (3, 2):

1. Initialize the queue with [(3, 2)] and the path as an empty list.
2. Initialize the visited set with {(3, 2)}.

Now, let's explore the possible moves from (3, 2):

- Move up to (2, 2) - this is a wall.
- Move down to (4, 2) - this is a wall.
- Move left to (3, 1) - this is an empty space.
- Move right to (3, 3) - this is an empty space.

We can move to (3, 1) or (3, 3). Let's add these positions to the queue and mark them as visited:

Queue: [((3, 1), [(3, 1)]), ((3, 3), [(3, 3)])]
Visited: {(3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3)}

Next, we explore the position (3, 1):

- Move up to (2, 1) - this is an empty space.
- Move down to (4, 1) - this is a wall.
- Move left to (3, 0) - this is a wall.
- Move right to (3, 2) - already visited.

We can move to (2, 1). Add this position to the queue and mark it as visited:

Queue: [((3, 3), [(3, 3)]), ((2, 1), [(3, 1), (2, 1)])]
Visited: {(3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (2, 1)}

Next, we explore the position (3, 3):

- Move up to (2, 3) - this is a wall.
- Move down to (4, 3) - this is a wall.
- Move left to (3, 2) - already visited.
- Move right to (3, 4) - this is an empty space.

We can move to (3, 4). Add this position to the queue and mark it as visited:

Queue: [((2, 1), [(3, 1), (2, 1)]), ((3, 4), [(3, 3), (3, 4)])]
Visited: {(3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (2, 1), (3, 4)}

Next, we explore the position (2, 1):

- Move up to (1, 1) - this is an empty space.
- Move down to (3, 1) - already visited.
- Move left to (2, 0) - this is a wall.
- Move right to (2, 2) - this is a wall.

We can move to (1, 1). Add this position to the queue and mark it as visited:

Queue: [((3, 4), [(3, 3), (3, 4)]), ((1, 1), [(3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1)])]
Visited: {(3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (2, 1), (3, 4), (1, 1)}

Next, we explore the position (3, 4):

- Move up to (2, 4) - this is an empty space.
- Move down to (4, 4) - this is a wall.
- Move left to (3, 3) - already visited.
- Move right to (3, 5) - out of bounds.

We can move to (2, 4). Add this position to the queue and mark it as visited:

Queue: [((1, 1), [(3, 1), (2, 1), (1

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current player position (2, 1) and the goal position (0, 2), let's continue using the BFS algorithm to find the next move.

From the current position (2, 1), we can explore the possible moves:

- Move up to (1, 1) - this is an empty space.
- Move down to (3, 1) - this is an empty space.
- Move left to (2, 0) - this is a wall.
- Move right to (2, 2) - this is a wall.

We can move to (1, 1) or (3, 1). Let's add these positions to the queue and mark them as visited:

Queue: [((1, 1), [(2, 1), (1, 1)]), ((3, 1), [(2, 1), (3, 1)])]
Visited: {(2, 1), (1, 1), (3, 1)}

Next, we explore the position (1, 1):

- Move up to (0, 1) - this is an empty space.
- Move down to (2, 1) - already visited.
- Move left to (1, 0) - this is a wall.
- Move right to (1, 2) - this is a wall.

We can move to (0, 1). Add this position to the queue and mark it as visited:

Queue: [((3, 1), [(2, 1), (3, 1)]), ((0, 1), [(2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1)])]
Visited: {(2, 1), (1, 1), (3, 1), (0, 1)}

Next, we explore the position (3, 1):

- Move up to (2, 1) - already visited.
- Move down to (4, 1) - this is a wall.
- Move left to (3, 0) - this is a wall.
- Move right to (3, 2) - this is an empty space.

We can move to (3, 2). Add this position to the queue and mark it as visited:

Queue: [((0, 1), [(2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1)]), ((3, 2), [(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)])]
Visited: {(2, 1), (1, 1), (3, 1), (0, 1), (3, 2)}

Next, we explore the position (0, 1):

- Move up to (-1, 1) - out of bounds.
- Move down to (1, 1) - already visited.
- Move left to (0, 0) - this is a wall.
- Move right to (0, 2) - this is the goal.

We can move to (0, 2), which is the goal. Therefore, the next move should be to (0, 2).

So, the coordinates of the next move are (0, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "zigzag" pattern.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" pattern. The new maze includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

New Maze:
- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- Empty: (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
- Player position: (3, 1)
- Goal: (0, 4)

This new maze maintains the "zigzag" pattern of empty spaces and provides a valid path from the player position to the goal position.
