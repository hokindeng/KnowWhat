You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (2, 1) to the goal at (0, 2) by moving through the empty spaces. We can move in any of the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) as long as the destination is an empty space.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (2, 1):

1. Up to (1, 1) - This is an empty space.
2. Down to (3, 1) - This is an empty space.
3. Left to (2, 0) - This is a wall.
4. Right to (2, 2) - This is an empty space.
5. Diagonal up-left to (1, 0) - This is a wall.
6. Diagonal up-right to (1, 2) - This is a wall.
7. Diagonal down-left to (3, 0) - This is a wall.
8. Diagonal down-right to (3, 2) - This is a wall.

From these options, moving right to (2, 2) seems like a good choice because it brings us closer to the goal at (0, 2).

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 2). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (1, 2) - This is a wall.
2. Down to (3, 2) - This is a wall.
3. Left to (2, 1) - This is an empty space.
4. Right to (2, 3) - This is a wall.
5. Diagonal up-left to (1, 1) - This is an empty space.
6. Diagonal up-right to (1, 3) - This is an empty space.
7. Diagonal down-left to (3, 1) - This is an empty space.
8. Diagonal down-right to (3, 3) - This is a wall.

The best move to get closer to the goal is to move diagonally up-right to (1, 3), as it positions us closer to the goal at (0, 2).

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 3), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 2). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (0, 3) - This is an empty space.
2. Down to (2, 3) - This is a wall.
3. Left to (1, 2) - This is a wall.
4. Right to (1, 4) - This is a wall.
5. Diagonal up-left to (0, 2) - This is the goal.
6. Diagonal up-right to (0, 4) - This is an empty space.
7. Diagonal down-left to (2, 2) - This is an empty space.
8. Diagonal down-right to (2, 4) - This is a wall.

The best move is to move diagonally up-left to (0, 2), which is the goal position.

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze. The empty spaces in the original maze are:

- (0, 1)
- (0, 3)
- (0, 4)
- (1, 1)
- (1, 3)
- (2, 1)
- (2, 2)
- (3, 1)

These empty spaces form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern, moving diagonally downwards and then upwards.

Now, let's create a new maze of the same size with a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern for the empty spaces. The original maze appears to be a 5x5 grid, so we'll maintain that size.

### New Maze

**Walls:**
- (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4)
- (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4)
- (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4)
- (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
- (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

**Empty:**
- (0, 1)
- (0, 3)
- (1, 1)
- (1, 3)
- (2, 1)
- (2, 2)
- (3, 1)

**Player position:** (2, 1)

**Goal:** (0, 3)

This new maze maintains the "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern of empty spaces, providing a valid path from the player position at (2, 1) to the goal at (0, 3).
