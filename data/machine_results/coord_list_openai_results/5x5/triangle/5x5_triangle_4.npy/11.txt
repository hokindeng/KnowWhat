You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player position at (2, 1) to the goal at (0, 2) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position:

Current player position: (2, 1)

Possible moves from (2, 1) to adjacent empty spaces:
- Move up to (1, 1)
- Move right to (2, 2)
- Move down to (3, 1)

Since the goal is at (0, 2), moving up to (1, 1) seems like a good step towards the goal. Therefore, the next move should be:

Move to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (1, 1), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 2). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

Current player position: (1, 1)

Possible moves from (1, 1) to adjacent empty spaces:
- Move up to (0, 1)
- Move right to (1, 3)
- Move down to (2, 1)

Since the goal is at (0, 2), moving up to (0, 1) brings us closer to the goal. Therefore, the next move should be:

Move to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (0, 1), we need to move towards the goal at (0, 2). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

Current player position: (0, 1)

Possible moves from (0, 1) to adjacent empty spaces:
- Move right to (0, 3)

However, we can also move diagonally to reach the goal directly:
- Move diagonally to (0, 2)

Since (0, 2) is the goal position, the next move should be:

Move to (0, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern is characterized by a series of connected steps that move diagonally or in a zigzag manner across the grid.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a similar zigzag pattern for the empty spaces. We'll ensure that there is a valid path from the player position to the goal.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Empty:** (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0)
- **Player position:** (4, 0)
- **Goal:** (0, 3)

This new maze maintains the zigzag pattern of empty spaces, providing a path from the player position at (4, 0) to the goal at (0, 3).
