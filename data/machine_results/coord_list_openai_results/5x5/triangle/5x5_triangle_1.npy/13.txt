You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (2, 4) to the goal position (2, 0) while avoiding walls and only moving through empty spaces. We can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* to find the shortest path. However, for simplicity, let's manually determine the next move step-by-step.

Here is the maze layout for reference:
```

W E W E W
W E E E P
W W W W W

```
Legend:
- W: Wall
- E: Empty space
- P: Player position
- G: Goal position

The player is currently at (2, 4). The goal is at (2, 0). Let's find the next move:

1. From (2, 4), the possible moves are:
   - (1, 3) - Up-left (diagonal)
   - (2, 3) - Left
   - (1, 4) - Up (not valid, it's a wall)
   - (3, 3) - Down-left (not valid, it's a wall)
   - (3, 4) - Down (not valid, it's a wall)

Among these, the valid move that brings us closer to the goal is (2, 3).

So, the next move is to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is currently at (2, 3). The goal is at (2, 0). Let's find the next move:

From (2, 3), the possible moves are:
- (1, 2) - Up-left (not valid, it's a wall)
- (2, 2) - Left
- (1, 3) - Up
- (3, 2) - Down-left (not valid, it's a wall)
- (3, 3) - Down (not valid, it's a wall)

Among these, the valid move that brings us closer to the goal is (2, 2).

So, the next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

Among these, the valid move that brings us closer to the goal is (2, 1).

So, the next move is to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "T" shape.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces that form a "T" shape. The new maze includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces and is not an identical copy of the original maze.

New maze:
```
Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 3)
```

Here is the new maze layout for reference:
```
W W W E W
W W E W W
W W E W W
W W P W W
W W W W W
```
Legend:
- W: Wall
- E: Empty space
- P: Player position
- G: Goal position

The player can move from (3, 2) to (2, 2), then to (1, 2), and finally to (0, 3) to reach the goal.
