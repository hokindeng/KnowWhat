You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position (4, 3) to the goal position (3, 1). We can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* or BFS to find the shortest path. For simplicity, let's use BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the next move.

Here are the steps to find the next move:

1. Initialize a queue with the current player position.
2. Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
3. For each position, check all possible moves (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
4. If a move leads to the goal, return that move.
5. If a move leads to an empty space, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.
6. Repeat until the goal is found or the queue is empty.

Let's apply this algorithm to the given maze.

### Initialization
- Current position: (4, 3)
- Goal position: (3, 1)
- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
- Empty spaces: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)

### BFS Algorithm
1. Initialize the queue with the current position: `queue = [(4, 3)]`
2. Initialize the visited set: `visited = {(4, 3)}`
3. Initialize the parent dictionary to reconstruct the path: `parent = {}`

### BFS Loop
- Dequeue (4, 3)
  - Possible moves: (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
  - Valid moves: (3, 3), (4, 2)
  - Add (3, 3) to the queue and mark as visited: `queue = [(3, 3)]`, `visited = {(4, 3), (3, 3)}`
  - Add (4, 2) to the queue and mark as visited: `queue = [(3, 3), (4, 2)]`, `visited = {(4, 3), (3, 3), (4, 2)}`
  - Update parent dictionary: `parent = {(3, 3): (4, 3), (4, 2): (4, 3)}`

- Dequeue (3, 3)
  - Possible moves: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
  - Valid moves: (2, 2), (2, 3)
  - Add (2, 2) to the queue and mark as visited: `queue = [(4, 2), (2, 2)]`, `visited = {(4, 3), (3, 3), (4, 2), (2, 2)}`
  - Add (2, 3) to the queue and mark as visited: `queue = [(4, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)]`, `visited = {(4, 3), (3, 3), (4, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)}`
  - Update parent dictionary: `parent = {(3, 3): (4, 3), (4, 2): (4, 3), (2, 2): (3, 3), (2, 3): (3, 3)}`

- Dequeue (4, 2)
  - Possible moves: (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)
  - Valid moves: (3, 1), (4, 1)
  - Goal found at (3, 1)

### Path Reconstruction
- Start from the goal (3, 1) and backtrack using the parent dictionary:
  - (3, 1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze can be described as a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The empty spaces create a path that moves diagonally and then horizontally or vertically, resembling steps.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5) with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The new maze includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

#### New Maze Encoding

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
- **Empty**: (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)
- **Player position**: (4, 3)
- **Goal**: (3, 3)

#### New Maze Layout

```
W W W W W
W W E W W
W W E W W
W W E E W
W W W P W
```

- **W**: Wall
- **E**: Empty space
- **P**: Player position
- **G**: Goal position

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern, and there is a valid path from the player position (4, 3) to the goal position (3, 3).
