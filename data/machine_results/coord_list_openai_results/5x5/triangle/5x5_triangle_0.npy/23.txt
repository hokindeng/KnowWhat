You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position (4, 3) to the goal position (3, 1). We can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* or BFS to find the shortest path. For simplicity, let's use BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the next move.

Here are the steps to find the next move:

1. Initialize a queue with the current player position.
2. Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
3. For each position, check all possible moves (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
4. If a move leads to the goal, return that move.
5. If a move leads to an empty space, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.

Let's apply this algorithm to find the next move.

### BFS Algorithm Implementation

1. Initialize the queue with the current player position (4, 3).
2. Initialize the visited set with the current player position.
3. Define the possible moves: up, down, left, right, and diagonals.
4. Process each position in the queue:
   - For each possible move, calculate the new position.
   - If the new position is the goal, return the new position.
   - If the new position is an empty space and not visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.

Let's start with the initial position (4, 3):

- Current position: (4, 3)
- Goal position: (3, 1)
- Possible moves: up, down, left, right, and diagonals

### Possible Moves from (4, 3)
- Up: (3, 3)
- Down: (5, 3) (out of bounds)
- Left: (4, 2)
- Right: (4, 4) (wall)
- Up-Left: (3, 2) (wall)
- Up-Right: (3, 4) (wall)
- Down-Left: (5, 2) (out of bounds)
- Down-Right: (5, 4) (out of bounds)

### Valid Moves
- Up: (3, 3) (empty)
- Left: (4, 2) (empty)

### Next Move
Since (3, 3) and (4, 2) are both valid moves, we can choose either. Let's choose (3, 3) as it brings us closer to the goal.

**Next Move: (3, 3)**

Please update the maze with the new player position (3, 3) and provide the updated maze for the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's continue with the BFS algorithm to find the next move from the current player position (3, 3) to the goal position (3, 1).

### Possible Moves from (3, 3)
- Up: (2, 3) (empty)
- Down: (4, 3) (empty)
- Left: (3, 2) (wall)
- Right: (3, 4) (wall)
- Up-Left: (2, 2) (empty)
- Up-Right: (2, 4) (wall)
- Down-Left: (4, 2) (empty)
- Down-Right: (4, 4) (wall)

### Valid Moves
- Up: (2, 3) (empty)
- Down: (4, 3) (empty)
- Up-Left: (2, 2) (empty)
- Down-Left: (4, 2) (empty)

### Next Move
Since (2, 3), (4, 3), (2, 2), and (4, 2) are all valid moves, we should choose the one that brings us closer to the goal (3, 1). The move (2, 2) seems to be the best option as it brings us closer to the goal.

**Next Move: (2, 2)**

Please update the maze with the new player position (2, 2) and provide the updated maze for the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's continue with the BFS algorithm to find the next move from the current player position (2, 2) to the goal position (3, 1).

### Possible Moves from (2, 2)
- Up: (1, 2) (wall)
- Down: (3, 2) (wall)
- Left: (2, 1) (wall)
- Right: (2, 3) (empty)
- Up-Left: (1, 1) (wall)
- Up-Right: (1, 3) (empty)
- Down-Left: (3, 1) (goal)
- Down-Right: (3, 3) (empty)

### Valid Moves
- Right: (2, 3) (empty)
- Up-Right: (1, 3) (empty)
- Down-Left: (3, 1) (goal)
- Down-Right: (3, 3) (empty)

### Next Move
Since (3, 1) is the goal, we should move directly to it.

**Next Move: (3, 1)**

Please update the maze with the new player position (3, 1) and confirm that the goal has been reached.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze can be described as a "Z" shape. The empty spaces form a path that resembles the letter "Z" when viewed on the grid.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with empty spaces that form a "Z" shape. The new maze includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

#### New Maze Encoding

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
- **Empty**: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2)
- **Player position**: (1, 2)
- **Goal**: (3, 2)

#### New Maze Layout

```
W W W W W
W W E W W
W E E E W
W W E W W
W W W W W
```

- W: Wall
- E: Empty space
- P: Player position (1, 2)
- G: Goal position (3, 2)

This new maze maintains the "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces and includes a valid path from the player position to the goal position.
