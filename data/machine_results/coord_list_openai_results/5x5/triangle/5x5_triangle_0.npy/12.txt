You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position (4, 3) to the goal position (3, 1) while avoiding walls and only moving through empty spaces. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path.

Here are the steps to find the next move:

1. Initialize a queue with the starting position (4, 3) and an empty set to keep track of visited positions.
2. For each position, check all possible moves (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
3. If a move leads to the goal position, return that move.
4. If a move leads to an empty space that hasn't been visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.
5. Repeat until the goal is reached or the queue is empty.

Let's apply this algorithm to find the next move:

1. Start at (4, 3).
2. Possible moves from (4, 3):
   - Up: (3, 3) (empty)
   - Down: (5, 3) (out of bounds)
   - Left: (4, 2) (empty)
   - Right: (4, 4) (wall)
   - Up-Left: (3, 2) (wall)
   - Up-Right: (3, 4) (wall)
   - Down-Left: (5, 2) (out of bounds)
   - Down-Right: (5, 4) (out of bounds)

From these possible moves, we can move to (3, 3) or (4, 2). Let's choose (3, 3) as it is closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's continue using the BFS algorithm to find the next move from the current player position (3, 3) to the goal position (3, 1).

1. Start at (3, 3).
2. Possible moves from (3, 3):
   - Up: (2, 3) (empty)
   - Down: (4, 3) (empty)
   - Left: (3, 2) (wall)
   - Right: (3, 4) (wall)
   - Up-Left: (2, 2) (empty)
   - Up-Right: (2, 4) (wall)
   - Down-Left: (4, 2) (empty)
   - Down-Right: (4, 4) (wall)

From these possible moves, we can move to (2, 3), (4, 3), (2, 2), or (4, 2). Let's choose (2, 2) as it is closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's continue using the BFS algorithm to find the next move from the current player position (2, 2) to the goal position (3, 1).

1. Start at (2, 2).
2. Possible moves from (2, 2):
   - Up: (1, 2) (wall)
   - Down: (3, 2) (wall)
   - Left: (2, 1) (wall)
   - Right: (2, 3) (empty)
   - Up-Left: (1, 1) (wall)
   - Up-Right: (1, 3) (empty)
   - Down-Left: (3, 1) (goal)
   - Down-Right: (3, 3) (empty)

From these possible moves, we can move to (2, 3), (1, 3), (3, 1), or (3, 3). Since (3, 1) is the goal, we should move there directly.

So, the next move is to (3, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "zigzag" pattern.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" pattern. The new maze includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 2)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a zigzag pattern similar to the original maze, and there is a valid path from the player position (4, 1) to the goal position (3, 2).
