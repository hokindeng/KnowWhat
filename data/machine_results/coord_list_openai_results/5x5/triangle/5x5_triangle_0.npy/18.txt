You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position (4, 3) to the goal position (3, 1) while avoiding walls and only moving through empty spaces. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path.

Let's start by examining the possible moves from the current position (4, 3):

1. Move up to (3, 3) - valid move (empty space)
2. Move down to (5, 3) - invalid move (out of bounds)
3. Move left to (4, 2) - valid move (empty space)
4. Move right to (4, 4) - invalid move (wall)
5. Move diagonally up-left to (3, 2) - invalid move (wall)
6. Move diagonally up-right to (3, 4) - invalid move (wall)
7. Move diagonally down-left to (5, 2) - invalid move (out of bounds)
8. Move diagonally down-right to (5, 4) - invalid move (out of bounds)

From the valid moves, we have two options: (3, 3) and (4, 2). Let's choose the move that brings us closer to the goal (3, 1). Moving to (3, 3) seems to be a better option as it is closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's examine the possible moves from the current position (3, 3):

1. Move up to (2, 3) - valid move (empty space)
2. Move down to (4, 3) - valid move (empty space, but we just came from there)
3. Move left to (3, 2) - invalid move (wall)
4. Move right to (3, 4) - invalid move (wall)
5. Move diagonally up-left to (2, 2) - valid move (empty space)
6. Move diagonally up-right to (2, 4) - invalid move (wall)
7. Move diagonally down-left to (4, 2) - valid move (empty space)
8. Move diagonally down-right to (4, 4) - invalid move (wall)

From the valid moves, we have three options: (2, 3), (2, 2), and (4, 2). Let's choose the move that brings us closer to the goal (3, 1). Moving to (2, 2) seems to be a good option as it is closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's examine the possible moves from the current position (2, 2):

1. Move up to (1, 2) - invalid move (wall)
2. Move down to (3, 2) - invalid move (wall)
3. Move left to (2, 1) - invalid move (wall)
4. Move right to (2, 3) - valid move (empty space)
5. Move diagonally up-left to (1, 1) - invalid move (wall)
6. Move diagonally up-right to (1, 3) - valid move (empty space)
7. Move diagonally down-left to (3, 1) - valid move (goal position)
8. Move diagonally down-right to (3, 3) - valid move (empty space)

From the valid moves, we have four options: (2, 3), (1, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 3). Moving to (3, 1) will directly reach the goal.

So, the next move is to (3, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze can be described as a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 3)

This new maze maintains the "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern of empty spaces and includes a valid path from the player position (4, 3) to the goal position (3, 3).
