You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (2, 2) to the goal position (2, 0) while avoiding walls and only moving through empty spaces. We can use a pathfinding algorithm like A* or BFS to find the shortest path. For simplicity, let's use BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the next move.

Here is the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path:

1. Initialize a queue with the starting position (2, 2).
2. Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.
3. For each position, explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
4. If a move leads to the goal position, return the path.
5. If a move leads to an empty space, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.
6. Repeat until the queue is empty or the goal is found.

Let's apply this algorithm to find the next move:

1. Start at (2, 2).
2. Possible moves from (2, 2):
   - Up-left: (1, 1) (wall)
   - Up: (1, 2) (wall)
   - Up-right: (1, 3) (empty)
   - Left: (2, 1) (wall)
   - Right: (2, 3) (wall)
   - Down-left: (3, 1) (empty)
   - Down: (3, 2) (wall)
   - Down-right: (3, 3) (wall)

From the possible moves, the valid empty spaces are (1, 3) and (3, 1).

3. Add (1, 3) and (3, 1) to the queue and mark them as visited.
4. Continue exploring from the next position in the queue.

Next, let's explore from (1, 3):
1. Possible moves from (1, 3):
   - Up-left: (0, 2) (empty)
   - Up: (0, 3) (empty)
   - Up-right: (0, 4) (empty)
   - Left: (1, 2) (wall)
   - Right: (1, 4) (wall)
   - Down-left: (2, 2) (already visited)
   - Down: (2, 3) (wall)
   - Down-right: (2, 4) (wall)

From the possible moves, the valid empty spaces are (0, 2), (0, 3), and (0, 4).

Next, let's explore from (3, 1):
1. Possible moves from (3, 1):
   - Up-left: (2, 0) (goal)
   - Up: (2, 1) (wall)
   - Up-right: (2, 2) (already visited)
   - Left: (3, 0) (empty)
   - Right: (3, 2) (wall)
   - Down-left: (4, 0) (empty)
   - Down: (4, 1) (wall)
   - Down-right: (4, 2) (wall)

From the possible moves, the valid empty spaces are (2, 0) (goal), (3, 0), and (4, 0).

Since (2, 0) is the goal, we have found the path.

The next move from (2, 2) to reach the goal (2, 0) is to move to (3, 1).

So, the coordinates of the next move are (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current player position (3, 1) and the goal position (2, 0), let's determine the next move using the same BFS approach.

1. Start at (3, 1).
2. Possible moves from (3, 1):
   - Up-left: (2, 0) (goal)
   - Up: (2, 1) (wall)
   - Up-right: (2, 2) (empty)
   - Left: (3, 0) (empty)
   - Right: (3, 2) (wall)
   - Down-left: (4, 0) (empty)
   - Down: (4, 1) (wall)
   - Down-right: (4, 2) (wall)

From the possible moves, the valid empty spaces are (2, 0) (goal), (2, 2), (3, 0), and (4, 0).

Since (2, 0) is the goal, we can move directly to it.

The next move from (3, 1) to reach the goal (2, 0) is to move to (2, 0).

So, the coordinates of the next move are (2, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze can be described as a "U-shape" or "horseshoe shape."

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar U-shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 4)

This new maze maintains the U-shape formed by the empty spaces and includes a valid path from the player position (2, 2) to the goal position (0, 4).
