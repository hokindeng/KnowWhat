You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position (2, 2) to the goal position (2, 0). We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the maze and find the shortest path. Let's start by exploring the possible moves from the current position.

The possible moves from (2, 2) are:
- Up: (1, 2) (wall)
- Down: (3, 2) (wall)
- Left: (2, 1) (wall)
- Right: (2, 3) (wall)
- Diagonal up-left: (1, 1) (wall)
- Diagonal up-right: (1, 3) (empty)
- Diagonal down-left: (3, 1) (empty)
- Diagonal down-right: (3, 3) (wall)

From the above options, the only valid moves are to (1, 3) and (3, 1). Let's choose one of these moves to proceed. We'll choose (1, 3) as the next move.

Next move: (1, 3)

Please update the maze with the new player position and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's explore the possible moves from the current position (1, 3):

The possible moves from (1, 3) are:
- Up: (0, 3) (empty)
- Down: (2, 3) (wall)
- Left: (1, 2) (wall)
- Right: (1, 4) (wall)
- Diagonal up-left: (0, 2) (empty)
- Diagonal up-right: (0, 4) (empty)
- Diagonal down-left: (2, 2) (empty)
- Diagonal down-right: (2, 4) (wall)

From the above options, the valid moves are to (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 4), and (2, 2). Since we need to move towards the goal (2, 0), let's choose the move that brings us closer to the goal. Moving to (2, 2) seems to be a good option as it brings us closer to the goal.

Next move: (2, 2)

Please update the maze with the new player position and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems I made an error in my previous move, as the player position did not change. Let's re-evaluate the possible moves from (1, 3) and choose a different path.

The possible moves from (1, 3) are:
- Up: (0, 3) (empty)
- Down: (2, 3) (wall)
- Left: (1, 2) (wall)
- Right: (1, 4) (wall)
- Diagonal up-left: (0, 2) (empty)
- Diagonal up-right: (0, 4) (empty)
- Diagonal down-left: (2, 2) (empty)
- Diagonal down-right: (2, 4) (wall)

From the above options, the valid moves are to (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 4), and (2, 2). Since moving to (2, 2) did not change the position, let's choose a different move. Moving to (0, 3) seems to be a good option as it brings us closer to the goal.

Next move: (0, 3)

Please update the maze with the new player position and provide the updated maze.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a U-shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze maintains the U-shape formed by the empty spaces and includes a valid path from the player position (2, 2) to the goal position (4, 4).
