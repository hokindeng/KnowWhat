You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (4, 4) to the goal at (2, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. We can move in any of the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) as long as the destination is an empty space.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (4, 4):

1. **Up** to (3, 4) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
2. **Down** - Not possible as it would go out of bounds.
3. **Left** to (4, 3) - This is an empty space, so it's possible.
4. **Right** - Not possible as it would go out of bounds.
5. **Up-Left** to (3, 3) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
6. **Up-Right** to (3, 5) - Not possible as it would go out of bounds.
7. **Down-Left** - Not possible as it would go out of bounds.
8. **Down-Right** - Not possible as it would go out of bounds.

The only valid move from (4, 4) is to move **Left** to (4, 3).

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal at (2, 3):

1. **Up** to (3, 3) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
2. **Down** - Not possible as it would go out of bounds.
3. **Left** to (4, 2) - This is an empty space, so it's possible.
4. **Right** to (4, 4) - This is an empty space, but it moves away from the goal.
5. **Up-Left** to (3, 2) - This is an empty space, so it's possible.
6. **Up-Right** to (3, 4) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
7. **Down-Left** - Not possible as it would go out of bounds.
8. **Down-Right** - Not possible as it would go out of bounds.

The best move towards the goal is **Up-Left** to (3, 2).

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal at (2, 3):

1. **Up** to (2, 2) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
2. **Down** to (4, 2) - This is an empty space, but it moves away from the goal.
3. **Left** to (3, 1) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
4. **Right** to (3, 3) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
5. **Up-Left** to (2, 1) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
6. **Up-Right** to (2, 3) - This is the goal position and is an empty space, so it's possible.
7. **Down-Left** to (4, 1) - This is an empty space, but it moves away from the goal.
8. **Down-Right** to (4, 3) - This is an empty space, but it moves away from the goal.

The best move is **Up-Right** to (2, 3), which is the goal position.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task:

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "Z" or zigzag pattern. The path starts at the bottom right, moves left, then diagonally up-left, and finally up-right to the goal.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces. The new maze will have a valid path from the player position to the goal, but it will not be identical to the original maze.

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1)
- **Empty:** (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Player position:** (4, 4)
- **Goal:** (2, 3)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a "Z" shape, starting from the bottom right, moving left, then diagonally up-left, and finally up-right to the goal.
