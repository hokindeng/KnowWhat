You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position (4, 4) to the goal position (2, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. We can move in any of the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) as long as the destination is an empty space.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (4, 4):

1. Move up to (3, 4) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
2. Move down to (5, 4) - This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.
3. Move left to (4, 3) - This is an empty space, so it's possible.
4. Move right to (4, 5) - This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.
5. Move diagonally up-left to (3, 3) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
6. Move diagonally up-right to (3, 5) - This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.
7. Move diagonally down-left to (5, 3) - This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.
8. Move diagonally down-right to (5, 5) - This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.

The only valid move is to the left, to the empty space at (4, 3).

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal at (2, 3):

1. Move up to (3, 3) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
2. Move down to (5, 3) - This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.
3. Move left to (4, 2) - This is an empty space, so it's possible.
4. Move right to (4, 4) - This is an empty space, so it's possible.
5. Move diagonally up-left to (3, 2) - This is an empty space, so it's possible.
6. Move diagonally up-right to (3, 4) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
7. Move diagonally down-left to (5, 2) - This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.
8. Move diagonally down-right to (5, 4) - This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.

To get closer to the goal at (2, 3), the best move is diagonally up-left to (3, 2), which is an empty space.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal at (2, 3):

1. Move up to (2, 2) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
2. Move down to (4, 2) - This is an empty space, so it's possible.
3. Move left to (3, 1) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
4. Move right to (3, 3) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
5. Move diagonally up-left to (2, 1) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
6. Move diagonally up-right to (2, 3) - This is the goal position, so it's possible.
7. Move diagonally down-left to (4, 1) - This is an empty space, so it's possible.
8. Move diagonally down-right to (4, 3) - This is an empty space, so it's possible.

The best move to reach the goal is diagonally up-right to (2, 3), which is the goal position.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape:**
   The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "Z" or zigzag pattern. The path starts at the bottom right, moves left, then diagonally up-left, and finally up-right to the goal.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

   Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces. The player will start at a different position, and the goal will also be at a different position, but the path will still form a "Z" shape.

   - **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
   - **Empty:** (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
   - **Player position:** (4, 3)
   - **Goal:** (1, 2)

   In this new maze, the empty spaces form a "Z" shape starting from the player position (4, 3), moving right to (4, 4), then diagonally up-left to (3, 2), and finally up-right to the goal at (1, 2).
