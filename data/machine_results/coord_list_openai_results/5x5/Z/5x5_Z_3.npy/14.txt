You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position (4, 4) to the goal position (2, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. We can move in any of the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) as long as the destination is an empty space.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (4, 4):

1. Up to (3, 4) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
2. Down to (5, 4) - This is outside the grid, so we cannot move here.
3. Left to (4, 3) - This is an empty space, so we can move here.
4. Right to (4, 5) - This is outside the grid, so we cannot move here.
5. Up-left to (3, 3) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
6. Up-right to (3, 5) - This is outside the grid, so we cannot move here.
7. Down-left to (5, 3) - This is outside the grid, so we cannot move here.
8. Down-right to (5, 5) - This is outside the grid, so we cannot move here.

The only valid move is to the left, to the empty space at (4, 3).

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal at (2, 3):

1. Up to (3, 3) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
2. Down to (5, 3) - This is outside the grid, so we cannot move here.
3. Left to (4, 2) - This is an empty space, so we can move here.
4. Right to (4, 4) - This is an empty space, but it moves us away from the goal.
5. Up-left to (3, 2) - This is an empty space, so we can move here.
6. Up-right to (3, 4) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
7. Down-left to (5, 2) - This is outside the grid, so we cannot move here.
8. Down-right to (5, 4) - This is outside the grid, so we cannot move here.

The best move towards the goal is up-left to (3, 2), which is an empty space.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal at (2, 3):

1. Up to (2, 2) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
2. Down to (4, 2) - This is an empty space, but it moves us away from the goal.
3. Left to (3, 1) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
4. Right to (3, 3) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
5. Up-left to (2, 1) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
6. Up-right to (2, 3) - This is the goal position, and it is an empty space, so we can move here.
7. Down-left to (4, 1) - This is an empty space, but it moves us away from the goal.
8. Down-right to (4, 3) - This is an empty space, but it moves us away from the goal.

The best move is up-right to (2, 3), which is the goal position.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

In the original maze, the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a "Z" or zigzag pattern. The path starts at the bottom right, moves left, then diagonally up-left, and finally up-right to the goal.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces. We'll ensure that there is a valid path from the player position to the goal.

**New Maze:**

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0)
- **Empty:** (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Player position:** (4, 4)
- **Goal:** (2, 4)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a "Z" shape, starting from the bottom right (4, 4), moving left to (4, 1), then diagonally up-right to (3, 4), and finally up-left to the goal at (2, 4). This maintains the recognizable "Z" pattern while providing a valid path from the player position to the goal.
