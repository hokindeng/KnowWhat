You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position to the goal position by moving through empty spaces. The player's current position is (0, 3), and the goal is at (4, 1). We can move in any of the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) to an adjacent empty space.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (0, 3):

1. **Up**: (0, 3) -> (-1, 3) (out of bounds)
2. **Down**: (0, 3) -> (1, 3) (empty space)
3. **Left**: (0, 3) -> (0, 2) (empty space)
4. **Right**: (0, 3) -> (0, 4) (empty space)
5. **Up-Left**: (0, 3) -> (-1, 2) (out of bounds)
6. **Up-Right**: (0, 3) -> (-1, 4) (out of bounds)
7. **Down-Left**: (0, 3) -> (1, 2) (wall)
8. **Down-Right**: (0, 3) -> (1, 4) (wall)

The valid moves are to (1, 3), (0, 2), and (0, 4). To move closer to the goal at (4, 1), let's choose the move that progresses us towards the goal. Moving to (1, 3) seems like a good option as it moves us downward, closer to the goal row.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 3), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 1). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (1, 3) -> (0, 3) (empty space)
2. **Down**: (1, 3) -> (2, 3) (wall)
3. **Left**: (1, 3) -> (1, 2) (wall)
4. **Right**: (1, 3) -> (1, 4) (wall)
5. **Up-Left**: (1, 3) -> (0, 2) (empty space)
6. **Up-Right**: (1, 3) -> (0, 4) (empty space)
7. **Down-Left**: (1, 3) -> (2, 2) (empty space)
8. **Down-Right**: (1, 3) -> (2, 4) (wall)

The valid moves are to (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 4), and (2, 2). To move closer to the goal at (4, 1), moving to (2, 2) is a good option as it progresses us downward and slightly to the left, closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 1). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (2, 2) -> (1, 2) (wall)
2. **Down**: (2, 2) -> (3, 2) (wall)
3. **Left**: (2, 2) -> (2, 1) (wall)
4. **Right**: (2, 2) -> (2, 3) (wall)
5. **Up-Left**: (2, 2) -> (1, 1) (wall)
6. **Up-Right**: (2, 2) -> (1, 3) (empty space)
7. **Down-Left**: (2, 2) -> (3, 1) (empty space)
8. **Down-Right**: (2, 2) -> (3, 3) (wall)

The valid moves are to (1, 3) and (3, 1). Moving to (3, 1) is the best option as it brings us closer to the goal at (4, 1).

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 1), we are very close to the goal at (4, 1). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (3, 1) -> (2, 1) (wall)
2. **Down**: (3, 1) -> (4, 1) (goal position)
3. **Left**: (3, 1) -> (3, 0) (wall)
4. **Right**: (3, 1) -> (3, 2) (wall)
5. **Up-Left**: (3, 1) -> (2, 0) (wall)
6. **Up-Right**: (3, 1) -> (2, 2) (empty space)
7. **Down-Left**: (3, 1) -> (4, 0) (empty space)
8. **Down-Right**: (3, 1) -> (4, 2) (empty space)

The move to (4, 1) is directly to the goal position. Therefore, the next move is to (4, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze. The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern, as they create a path that moves diagonally downwards and then shifts direction.

### (1) Name of the General Shape:
The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "zigzag" pattern.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape:
Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a zigzag pattern of empty spaces. The new maze will have a valid path from the player position to the goal position, but it will not be identical to the original maze.

#### New Maze Configuration:
- **Walls**: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4)
- **Empty**: (0, 0), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
- **Player position**: (0, 0)
- **Goal**: (4, 3)

This new maze maintains the zigzag pattern of empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal position.
