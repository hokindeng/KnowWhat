You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces and avoiding walls. The player's current position is (0, 3), and the goal is at (4, 1).

Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (0, 3):

1. Move up to (−1, 3) - Out of bounds, not possible.
2. Move down to (1, 3) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
3. Move left to (0, 2) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
4. Move right to (0, 4) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
5. Move diagonally to (−1, 2) - Out of bounds, not possible.
6. Move diagonally to (−1, 4) - Out of bounds, not possible.
7. Move diagonally to (1, 2) - This is a wall, not possible.
8. Move diagonally to (1, 4) - This is a wall, not possible.

From these options, let's choose to move down to (1, 3), as it brings us closer to the goal at (4, 1).

The next move is to (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Move up to (0, 3) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
2. Move down to (2, 3) - This is a wall, not possible.
3. Move left to (1, 2) - This is a wall, not possible.
4. Move right to (1, 4) - This is a wall, not possible.
5. Move diagonally to (0, 2) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
6. Move diagonally to (0, 4) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
7. Move diagonally to (2, 2) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
8. Move diagonally to (2, 4) - This is a wall, not possible.

To progress towards the goal at (4, 1), moving diagonally to (2, 2) seems like a good choice, as it brings us closer to the goal.

The next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Move up to (1, 2) - This is a wall, not possible.
2. Move down to (3, 2) - This is a wall, not possible.
3. Move left to (2, 1) - This is a wall, not possible.
4. Move right to (2, 3) - This is a wall, not possible.
5. Move diagonally to (1, 1) - This is a wall, not possible.
6. Move diagonally to (1, 3) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
7. Move diagonally to (3, 1) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
8. Move diagonally to (3, 3) - This is a wall, not possible.

To progress towards the goal at (4, 1), moving diagonally to (3, 1) is a good choice, as it brings us closer to the goal.

The next move is to (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Move up to (2, 1) - This is a wall, not possible.
2. Move down to (4, 1) - This is the goal position, so it's a valid move.
3. Move left to (3, 0) - This is a wall, not possible.
4. Move right to (3, 2) - This is a wall, not possible.
5. Move diagonally to (2, 0) - This is a wall, not possible.
6. Move diagonally to (2, 2) - This is an empty space, but not necessary since we can reach the goal directly.
7. Move diagonally to (4, 0) - This is an empty space, but not necessary since we can reach the goal directly.
8. Move diagonally to (4, 2) - This is an empty space, but not necessary since we can reach the goal directly.

The optimal move is to move down to (4, 1), which is the goal position.

The next move is to (4, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task:

1. **Name of the General Shape:**
   The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern is characterized by a path that moves diagonally or in a step-like fashion through the grid.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

   Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a similar "zigzag" pattern for the empty spaces. The new maze will have a valid path from the player position to the goal position.

   **New Maze:**

   - **Walls:** (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
   - **Empty:** (0, 0), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
   - **Player position:** (0, 0)
   - **Goal:** (4, 2)

   In this new maze, the empty spaces form a zigzag pattern similar to the original maze, and there is a valid path from the player position (0, 0) to the goal position (4, 2).
