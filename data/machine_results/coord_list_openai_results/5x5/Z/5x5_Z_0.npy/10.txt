You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (0, 3) to the goal position (4, 1) by moving through the empty spaces while avoiding walls. We can move in any of the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonally).

Let's analyze the current position and possible moves:

- Current position: (0, 3)
- Possible moves from (0, 3) to adjacent empty spaces:
  - Right to (0, 4)
  - Down to (1, 3)

Since (1, 3) is closer to the goal (4, 1), let's move down to (1, 3).

Next move: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

- Current position: (1, 3)
- Possible moves from (1, 3) to adjacent empty spaces:
  - Up to (0, 3)
  - Down to (2, 2)

Since moving down to (2, 2) brings us closer to the goal (4, 1), let's move down to (2, 2).

Next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

- Current position: (2, 2)
- Possible moves from (2, 2) to adjacent empty spaces:
  - Up to (1, 3)
  - Down to (3, 1)

Moving down to (3, 1) brings us closer to the goal (4, 1), so let's move down to (3, 1).

Next move: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

- Current position: (3, 1)
- Possible moves from (3, 1) to adjacent empty spaces:
  - Up to (2, 2)
  - Down to (4, 0)
  - Right to (4, 2)

The goal position (4, 1) is directly below (3, 1). Since moving down to (4, 1) will reach the goal, let's move down to (4, 1).

Next move: (4, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "Z" or zigzag pattern. This pattern starts at the top left, moves diagonally down to the right, and then continues downwards.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces. The new maze will have a valid path from the player position to the goal position, but it will not be identical to the original maze.

- **Walls:** (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1)
- **Empty:** (0, 0), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Player position:** (0, 0)
- **Goal:** (4, 4)

This new maze maintains the "Z" shape of the empty spaces, starting from the top left, moving diagonally down to the right, and then continuing downwards to the goal.
