You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position to the goal position by moving through empty spaces. The player's current position is (0, 3), and the goal is at (4, 1).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (0, 3):

1. **Up**: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
2. **Down**: (1, 3) - This is an empty space.
3. **Left**: (0, 2) - This is an empty space.
4. **Right**: (0, 4) - This is an empty space.
5. **Diagonals**:
   - Top-left: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
   - Top-right: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
   - Bottom-left: (1, 2) - This is a wall.
   - Bottom-right: (1, 4) - This is a wall.

From (0, 3), the viable moves are to (1, 3), (0, 2), or (0, 4). To progress towards the goal at (4, 1), moving to (1, 3) seems like a good choice because it moves us closer to the goal vertically.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (0, 3) - This is an empty space.
2. **Down**: (2, 3) - This is a wall.
3. **Left**: (1, 2) - This is a wall.
4. **Right**: (1, 4) - This is a wall.
5. **Diagonals**:
   - Top-left: (0, 2) - This is an empty space.
   - Top-right: (0, 4) - This is an empty space.
   - Bottom-left: (2, 2) - This is an empty space.
   - Bottom-right: (2, 4) - This is a wall.

The viable moves from (1, 3) are to (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 4), or (2, 2). To progress towards the goal at (4, 1), moving to (2, 2) seems like a good choice because it moves us closer to the goal vertically and horizontally.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (1, 2) - This is a wall.
2. **Down**: (3, 2) - This is a wall.
3. **Left**: (2, 1) - This is a wall.
4. **Right**: (2, 3) - This is a wall.
5. **Diagonals**:
   - Top-left: (1, 1) - This is a wall.
   - Top-right: (1, 3) - This is an empty space.
   - Bottom-left: (3, 1) - This is an empty space.
   - Bottom-right: (3, 3) - This is a wall.

The viable moves from (2, 2) are to (1, 3) or (3, 1). To progress towards the goal at (4, 1), moving to (3, 1) is the best choice because it moves us closer to the goal vertically.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (2, 1) - This is a wall.
2. **Down**: (4, 1) - This is the goal position.
3. **Left**: (3, 0) - This is a wall.
4. **Right**: (3, 2) - This is a wall.
5. **Diagonals**:
   - Top-left: (2, 0) - This is a wall.
   - Top-right: (2, 2) - This is an empty space.
   - Bottom-left: (4, 0) - This is an empty space.
   - Bottom-right: (4, 2) - This is an empty space.

The move to (4, 1) will take us directly to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape

The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "Z" or zigzag pattern. The path starts at the top, moves diagonally downwards, and then continues horizontally and vertically to reach the goal.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces. The new maze should have a valid path from the player position to the goal.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1)
- **Empty**: (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Player position**: (0, 2)
- **Goal**: (4, 4)

This new maze maintains the "Z" shape of the empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal. The path starts at (0, 2), moves diagonally downwards, and then continues horizontally and vertically to reach the goal at (4, 4).
