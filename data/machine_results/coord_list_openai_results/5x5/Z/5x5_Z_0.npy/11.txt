You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (0, 3) to the goal position (4, 1) by moving through the empty spaces while avoiding the walls. We can move in any of the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (0, 3):

1. **Up**: (0, 3) -> (-1, 3) (out of bounds)
2. **Down**: (0, 3) -> (1, 3) (empty space)
3. **Left**: (0, 3) -> (0, 2) (empty space)
4. **Right**: (0, 3) -> (0, 4) (empty space)
5. **Up-Left**: (0, 3) -> (-1, 2) (out of bounds)
6. **Up-Right**: (0, 3) -> (-1, 4) (out of bounds)
7. **Down-Left**: (0, 3) -> (1, 2) (wall)
8. **Down-Right**: (0, 3) -> (1, 4) (wall)

From these options, the valid moves are:
- Down to (1, 3)
- Left to (0, 2)
- Right to (0, 4)

To make progress towards the goal (4, 1), moving down to (1, 3) seems like a good choice because it brings us closer to the goal and keeps us on a path of empty spaces.

Therefore, the next move is to go **down** to (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 3), we need to continue moving towards the goal (4, 1) while navigating through empty spaces. Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (1, 3) -> (0, 3) (empty space)
2. **Down**: (1, 3) -> (2, 3) (wall)
3. **Left**: (1, 3) -> (1, 2) (wall)
4. **Right**: (1, 3) -> (1, 4) (wall)
5. **Up-Left**: (1, 3) -> (0, 2) (empty space)
6. **Up-Right**: (1, 3) -> (0, 4) (empty space)
7. **Down-Left**: (1, 3) -> (2, 2) (empty space)
8. **Down-Right**: (1, 3) -> (2, 4) (wall)

The valid moves are:
- Up to (0, 3)
- Up-Left to (0, 2)
- Up-Right to (0, 4)
- Down-Left to (2, 2)

To make progress towards the goal (4, 1), moving **down-left** to (2, 2) is a good choice because it brings us closer to the goal and keeps us on a path of empty spaces.

Therefore, the next move is to go **down-left** to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 2), we need to continue moving towards the goal (4, 1) while navigating through empty spaces. Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (2, 2) -> (1, 2) (wall)
2. **Down**: (2, 2) -> (3, 2) (wall)
3. **Left**: (2, 2) -> (2, 1) (wall)
4. **Right**: (2, 2) -> (2, 3) (wall)
5. **Up-Left**: (2, 2) -> (1, 1) (wall)
6. **Up-Right**: (2, 2) -> (1, 3) (empty space)
7. **Down-Left**: (2, 2) -> (3, 1) (empty space)
8. **Down-Right**: (2, 2) -> (3, 3) (wall)

The valid moves are:
- Up-Right to (1, 3)
- Down-Left to (3, 1)

To make progress towards the goal (4, 1), moving **down-left** to (3, 1) is the best choice because it brings us closer to the goal and keeps us on a path of empty spaces.

Therefore, the next move is to go **down-left** to (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 1), we are very close to the goal (4, 1). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (3, 1) -> (2, 1) (wall)
2. **Down**: (3, 1) -> (4, 1) (goal position)
3. **Left**: (3, 1) -> (3, 0) (wall)
4. **Right**: (3, 1) -> (3, 2) (wall)
5. **Up-Left**: (3, 1) -> (2, 0) (wall)
6. **Up-Right**: (3, 1) -> (2, 2) (empty space)
7. **Down-Left**: (3, 1) -> (4, 0) (empty space)
8. **Down-Right**: (3, 1) -> (4, 2) (empty space)

The valid move that takes us directly to the goal is:
- Down to (4, 1)

Therefore, the next move is to go **down** to (4, 1), reaching the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape

The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern is characterized by a series of connected diagonal and straight segments that create a path through the maze.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a similar "zigzag" pattern of empty spaces. We'll ensure that there is a valid path from the player position to the goal.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls**: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1)
- **Empty**: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Player position**: (0, 0)
- **Goal**: (4, 4)

This new maze maintains a "zigzag" pattern of empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal. The path is not identical to the original maze but retains the recognizable shape.
