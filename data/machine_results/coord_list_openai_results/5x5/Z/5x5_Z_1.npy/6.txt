You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces and avoiding walls. The player's current position is (1, 3), and the goal is at (1, 0).

Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (1, 3):

1. Move left to (1, 2) - This is an empty space.
2. Move up-left to (0, 2) - This is a wall.
3. Move up to (0, 3) - This is a wall.
4. Move up-right to (0, 4) - This is a wall.
5. Move right to (1, 4) - This is a wall.
6. Move down-right to (2, 4) - This is a wall.
7. Move down to (2, 3) - This is a wall.
8. Move down-left to (2, 2) - This is an empty space.

From the current position (1, 3), the valid moves are to (1, 2) and (2, 2). To get closer to the goal at (1, 0), moving left to (1, 2) is a good choice.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal at (1, 0):

1. Move left to (1, 1) - This is an empty space.
2. Move up-left to (0, 1) - This is a wall.
3. Move up to (0, 2) - This is a wall.
4. Move up-right to (0, 3) - This is a wall.
5. Move right to (1, 3) - This is an empty space.
6. Move down-right to (2, 3) - This is a wall.
7. Move down to (2, 2) - This is an empty space.
8. Move down-left to (2, 1) - This is a wall.

To get closer to the goal at (1, 0), moving left to (1, 1) is the best choice.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal at (1, 0):

1. Move left to (1, 0) - This is the goal position.
2. Move up-left to (0, 0) - This is a wall.
3. Move up to (0, 1) - This is a wall.
4. Move up-right to (0, 2) - This is a wall.
5. Move right to (1, 2) - This is an empty space.
6. Move down-right to (2, 2) - This is an empty space.
7. Move down to (2, 1) - This is a wall.
8. Move down-left to (2, 0) - This is a wall.

The goal position (1, 0) is directly to the left of the current position (1, 1).

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze. The empty spaces in the original maze are:

- (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)
- (2, 2)
- (3, 1)
- (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)

These empty spaces form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern, moving downwards and to the right.

Now, let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5) with a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern for the empty spaces. The new maze should have a valid path from the player position to the goal position.

### New Maze

**Walls:**
- (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)
- (1, 0), (1, 4)
- (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4)
- (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
- (4, 4)

**Empty:**
- (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)
- (2, 2)
- (3, 1)
- (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)

**Player position:** (1, 3)

**Goal:** (4, 3)

This new maze maintains the "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern of empty spaces, and there is a valid path from the player position (1, 3) to the goal (4, 3) through the empty spaces.
