You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (1, 3) to the goal position (1, 0) by moving through the empty spaces. We can move in any of the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) as long as the destination is an empty space.

Let's evaluate the possible moves from the current position (1, 3):

1. **Up** to (0, 3) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
2. **Down** to (2, 3) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
3. **Left** to (1, 2) - This is an empty space, so we can move here.
4. **Right** to (1, 4) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
5. **Up-Left** to (0, 2) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
6. **Up-Right** to (0, 4) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
7. **Down-Left** to (2, 2) - This is an empty space, so we can move here.
8. **Down-Right** to (2, 4) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.

The viable moves are to (1, 2) and (2, 2). To get closer to the goal (1, 0), moving to (1, 2) is a more direct path.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 2), we need to continue moving towards the goal position (1, 0). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up** to (0, 2) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
2. **Down** to (2, 2) - This is an empty space, so we can move here.
3. **Left** to (1, 1) - This is an empty space, so we can move here.
4. **Right** to (1, 3) - This is an empty space, so we can move here.
5. **Up-Left** to (0, 1) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
6. **Up-Right** to (0, 3) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
7. **Down-Left** to (2, 1) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
8. **Down-Right** to (2, 3) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.

The viable moves are to (2, 2), (1, 1), and (1, 3). To get closer to the goal (1, 0), moving to (1, 1) is the best option.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 1), we need to move to the goal position (1, 0). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up** to (0, 1) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
2. **Down** to (2, 1) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
3. **Left** to (1, 0) - This is the goal position, so we can move here.
4. **Right** to (1, 2) - This is an empty space, but it takes us away from the goal.
5. **Up-Left** to (0, 0) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
6. **Up-Right** to (0, 2) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
7. **Down-Left** to (2, 0) - This is a wall, so we cannot move here.
8. **Down-Right** to (2, 2) - This is an empty space, but it takes us away from the goal.

The best move is to (1, 0), which is the goal position.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

In the original maze, the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a "Z" or zigzag pattern. The path starts at the top right, moves left, then diagonally down to the left, and finally moves horizontally to the left again.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces. We'll ensure that there is a valid path from the player position to the goal position.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
- **Empty:** (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 4)
- **Player position:** (1, 1)
- **Goal:** (4, 4)

This new maze maintains the "Z" shape of the empty spaces and provides a valid path from the player position (1, 1) to the goal (4, 4). The path is as follows: (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (3, 2) → (4, 4).
