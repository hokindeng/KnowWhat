You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (3, 4) to the goal at (2, 2) by moving through the empty spaces. We can move in any of the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) as long as the destination is an empty space.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (3, 4):

1. **Up** to (2, 4) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
2. **Down** to (4, 4) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
3. **Left** to (3, 3) - This is an empty space, so it's possible.
4. **Right** to (3, 5) - This is outside the maze bounds, so it's not possible.
5. **Up-Left** to (2, 3) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
6. **Up-Right** to (2, 5) - This is outside the maze bounds, so it's not possible.
7. **Down-Left** to (4, 3) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
8. **Down-Right** to (4, 5) - This is outside the maze bounds, so it's not possible.

The only valid move from (3, 4) is to move **Left** to (3, 3).

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 3), we need to find a path to the goal at (2, 2) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up** to (2, 3) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
2. **Down** to (4, 3) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
3. **Left** to (3, 2) - This is an empty space, so it's possible.
4. **Right** to (3, 4) - This is an empty space, but it leads back to the previous position.
5. **Up-Left** to (2, 2) - This is the goal position, so it's possible and desirable.
6. **Up-Right** to (2, 4) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
7. **Down-Left** to (4, 2) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
8. **Down-Right** to (4, 4) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.

The optimal move is **Up-Left** to (2, 2), which is the goal position.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

Upon examining the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a shape that resembles a **"C"**. The empty spaces are arranged in a way that creates a corridor that curves around the walls, similar to the letter "C".

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Now, let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with empty spaces that form a "C" shape. The new maze should have a valid path from the player position to the goal position.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Empty**: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
- **Player position**: (3, 1)
- **Goal**: (2, 4)

This new maze maintains the "C" shape formed by the empty spaces and provides a valid path from the player position (3, 1) to the goal (2, 4). The path can be navigated as follows: (3, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4).
