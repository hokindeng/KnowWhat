You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (3, 4) to the goal position at (2, 2) by moving through the empty spaces. We can move in any of the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) as long as the destination is an empty space.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (3, 4):

1. Up to (2, 4) - This is a wall.
2. Down to (4, 4) - This is a wall.
3. Left to (3, 3) - This is an empty space.
4. Right to (3, 5) - This is out of bounds.
5. Up-left to (2, 3) - This is a wall.
6. Up-right to (2, 5) - This is out of bounds.
7. Down-left to (4, 3) - This is a wall.
8. Down-right to (4, 5) - This is out of bounds.

The only valid move is to the left, to the empty space at (3, 3).

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 3), we need to find a path to the goal at (2, 2). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (2, 3) - This is a wall.
2. Down to (4, 3) - This is a wall.
3. Left to (3, 2) - This is an empty space.
4. Right to (3, 4) - This is an empty space.
5. Up-left to (2, 2) - This is the goal.
6. Up-right to (2, 4) - This is a wall.
7. Down-left to (4, 2) - This is a wall.
8. Down-right to (4, 4) - This is a wall.

The optimal move is up-left to (2, 2), which is the goal position.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "U" shape. The empty spaces create a path that starts at the top, goes down the right side, and then moves left along the bottom, forming a "U" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with empty spaces forming a "U" shape:

- Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2)
- Player position: (3, 3)
- Goal: (2, 2)

This new maze maintains the "U" shape of the empty spaces, with a valid path from the player position (3, 3) to the goal (2, 2).
