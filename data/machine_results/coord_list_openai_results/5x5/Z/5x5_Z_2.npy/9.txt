You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (0, 2) to the goal position (2, 1) by moving through the empty spaces. We can move in any of the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) as long as the destination is an empty space.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (0, 2):

1. Move up to (−1, 2) - Not possible, out of bounds.
2. Move down to (1, 2) - Possible, as it is an empty space.
3. Move left to (0, 1) - Possible, as it is an empty space.
4. Move right to (0, 3) - Possible, as it is an empty space.
5. Move diagonally to (−1, 1) - Not possible, out of bounds.
6. Move diagonally to (−1, 3) - Not possible, out of bounds.
7. Move diagonally to (1, 1) - Not possible, it is a wall.
8. Move diagonally to (1, 3) - Not possible, it is a wall.

From these options, moving to (1, 2) seems like a good choice because it brings us closer to the goal (2, 1).

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 2), we need to find a path to the goal position (2, 1) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Move up to (0, 2) - Possible, as it is an empty space.
2. Move down to (2, 2) - Not possible, it is a wall.
3. Move left to (1, 1) - Not possible, it is a wall.
4. Move right to (1, 3) - Not possible, it is a wall.
5. Move diagonally to (0, 1) - Possible, as it is an empty space.
6. Move diagonally to (0, 3) - Possible, as it is an empty space.
7. Move diagonally to (2, 1) - Possible, and it is the goal position.
8. Move diagonally to (2, 3) - Not possible, it is a wall.

The best move is to go directly to the goal position (2, 1).

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape:**
   The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "U" or "C" shape. This is because the empty spaces create a path that loops around the walls, starting from the top left, moving down, and then back up on the right side.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

   Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a similar "U" or "C" shape formed by the empty spaces. The new maze will have a valid path from the player position to the goal position.

   **New Maze:**

   - **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
   - **Empty:** (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)
   - **Player position:** (0, 2)
   - **Goal:** (4, 4)

   In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar "U" or "C" shape, starting from the top, moving down, and then back up on the right side, allowing a path from the player position to the goal.
