You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (0, 2) to the goal position (2, 1) by moving through the empty spaces. We can move in any of the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) as long as the destination is an empty space.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (0, 2):

1. **Up**: (0, 2) -> (-1, 2) (out of bounds)
2. **Down**: (0, 2) -> (1, 2) (empty space)
3. **Left**: (0, 2) -> (0, 1) (empty space)
4. **Right**: (0, 2) -> (0, 3) (empty space)
5. **Up-Left**: (0, 2) -> (-1, 1) (out of bounds)
6. **Up-Right**: (0, 2) -> (-1, 3) (out of bounds)
7. **Down-Left**: (0, 2) -> (1, 1) (wall)
8. **Down-Right**: (0, 2) -> (1, 3) (wall)

From these options, the valid moves are:
- Down to (1, 2)
- Left to (0, 1)
- Right to (0, 3)

To move closer to the goal (2, 1), moving down to (1, 2) seems like a good choice because it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 2), we need to find a path to the goal position (2, 1) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (1, 2) -> (0, 2) (empty space)
2. **Down**: (1, 2) -> (2, 2) (wall)
3. **Left**: (1, 2) -> (1, 1) (wall)
4. **Right**: (1, 2) -> (1, 3) (wall)
5. **Up-Left**: (1, 2) -> (0, 1) (empty space)
6. **Up-Right**: (1, 2) -> (0, 3) (empty space)
7. **Down-Left**: (1, 2) -> (2, 1) (goal)
8. **Down-Right**: (1, 2) -> (2, 3) (wall)

The move directly to the goal position (2, 1) is possible by moving diagonally down-left.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces**: The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "U" or a "C" shape. This is because the empty spaces create a path that loops around the walls, starting from the top left, moving down, and then back up on the right side.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape**:

Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a "U" or "C" shaped path. We'll ensure that there is a valid path from the player position to the goal position.

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4)
- **Empty**: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
- **Player position**: (1, 0)
- **Goal**: (3, 2)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a "U" shape, starting from the player position at (1, 0), moving down to (4, 0), then across to (4, 2), and finally up to the goal at (3, 2). This maintains the general "U" shape while providing a different configuration from the original maze.
