You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (0, 2) to the goal position (2, 1) by moving through the empty spaces. We can move in any of the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) as long as the destination is an empty space.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (0, 2):

1. Move up to (−1, 2) - Out of bounds, not possible.
2. Move down to (1, 2) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
3. Move left to (0, 1) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
4. Move right to (0, 3) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
5. Move diagonally up-left to (−1, 1) - Out of bounds, not possible.
6. Move diagonally up-right to (−1, 3) - Out of bounds, not possible.
7. Move diagonally down-left to (1, 1) - This is a wall, not possible.
8. Move diagonally down-right to (1, 3) - This is a wall, not possible.

From these options, moving to (1, 2) seems like a good choice because it brings us closer to the goal (2, 1).

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 2), we need to find a path to the goal position (2, 1) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Move up to (0, 2) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
2. Move down to (2, 2) - This is a wall, not possible.
3. Move left to (1, 1) - This is a wall, not possible.
4. Move right to (1, 3) - This is a wall, not possible.
5. Move diagonally up-left to (0, 1) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
6. Move diagonally up-right to (0, 3) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
7. Move diagonally down-left to (2, 1) - This is the goal position, and it's an empty space, so it's a valid move.
8. Move diagonally down-right to (2, 3) - This is a wall, not possible.

The best move is to go directly to the goal position (2, 1).

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

Upon examining the empty spaces in the original maze, we can see that they form a shape resembling a "U" or a "C" shape. The empty spaces are primarily located around the perimeter of the maze, with a gap on one side, which is characteristic of these shapes.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Now, let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with empty spaces forming a similar "U" or "C" shape. We'll ensure that there is a valid path from the player position to the goal position.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4)
- **Empty:** (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
- **Player position:** (1, 0)
- **Goal:** (3, 2)

This new maze maintains the "U" or "C" shape of the empty spaces, with a valid path from the player position (1, 0) to the goal position (3, 2). The path can be navigated by moving through the empty spaces, ensuring the maze is solvable.
