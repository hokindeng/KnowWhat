You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces and avoiding walls. The player's current position is (0, 2), and the goal is at (2, 1).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (0, 2):

1. **Up**: (0, 2) -> (-1, 2) (out of bounds, not possible)
2. **Down**: (0, 2) -> (1, 2) (empty space, possible)
3. **Left**: (0, 2) -> (0, 1) (empty space, possible)
4. **Right**: (0, 2) -> (0, 3) (empty space, possible)
5. **Diagonal Up-Left**: (0, 2) -> (-1, 1) (out of bounds, not possible)
6. **Diagonal Up-Right**: (0, 2) -> (-1, 3) (out of bounds, not possible)
7. **Diagonal Down-Left**: (0, 2) -> (1, 1) (wall, not possible)
8. **Diagonal Down-Right**: (0, 2) -> (1, 3) (wall, not possible)

From the analysis, the possible moves are:
- Down to (1, 2)
- Left to (0, 1)
- Right to (0, 3)

To move closer to the goal (2, 1), the best move is to go **down to (1, 2)**, as it brings us closer to the goal position.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 2), we need to find a path to the goal position (2, 1) by moving through empty spaces and avoiding walls.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (1, 2):

1. **Up**: (1, 2) -> (0, 2) (empty space, possible)
2. **Down**: (1, 2) -> (2, 2) (wall, not possible)
3. **Left**: (1, 2) -> (1, 1) (wall, not possible)
4. **Right**: (1, 2) -> (1, 3) (wall, not possible)
5. **Diagonal Up-Left**: (1, 2) -> (0, 1) (empty space, possible)
6. **Diagonal Up-Right**: (1, 2) -> (0, 3) (empty space, possible)
7. **Diagonal Down-Left**: (1, 2) -> (2, 1) (goal position, possible)
8. **Diagonal Down-Right**: (1, 2) -> (2, 3) (wall, not possible)

The possible moves are:
- Up to (0, 2)
- Diagonal Up-Left to (0, 1)
- Diagonal Up-Right to (0, 3)
- Diagonal Down-Left to (2, 1) (goal position)

The best move is to go **diagonally down-left to (2, 1)**, as it directly reaches the goal position.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first analyze the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

The empty spaces in the original maze are:
- (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)
- (1, 2)
- (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

These empty spaces form a shape that resembles a "T" when visualized on the grid. The top of the "T" is formed by the row of empty spaces at the top (0, 0) to (0, 3), and the vertical part of the "T" is formed by the column of empty spaces at (1, 2) and (3, 0) to (3, 3).

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with empty spaces forming a "T" shape, ensuring it includes a valid path from a new player position to a new goal position.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls**: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Empty**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (2, 2)
- **Player position**: (0, 0)
- **Goal**: (3, 3)

This new maze maintains the "T" shape of the empty spaces and provides a valid path from the player position (0, 0) to the goal (3, 3). The path can be: (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 3).
