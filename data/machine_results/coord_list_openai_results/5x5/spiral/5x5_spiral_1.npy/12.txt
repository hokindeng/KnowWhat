You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (0, 4) to the goal position (2, 1) while avoiding walls and only moving through empty spaces. We can use a pathfinding algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path.

Let's start by examining the possible moves from the current position (0, 4):

1. Move up to (0, 3) - valid move (empty space)
2. Move down to (1, 4) - valid move (empty space)
3. Move left to (0, 3) - valid move (empty space)
4. Move right to (0, 5) - invalid move (out of bounds)

Since moving up and left both lead to the same position (0, 3), we can choose either. Let's move to (0, 3).

Next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), let's examine the possible moves:

1. Move up to (0, 2) - valid move (empty space)
2. Move down to (1, 3) - invalid move (wall)
3. Move left to (0, 2) - valid move (empty space)
4. Move right to (0, 4) - valid move (empty space)

Since moving up and left both lead to the same position (0, 2), we can choose either. Let's move to (0, 2).

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), let's examine the possible moves:

1. Move up to (0, 1) - valid move (empty space)
2. Move down to (1, 2) - invalid move (wall)
3. Move left to (0, 1) - valid move (empty space)
4. Move right to (0, 3) - valid move (empty space)

Since moving up and left both lead to the same position (0, 1), we can choose either. Let's move to (0, 1).

Next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), let's examine the possible moves:

1. Move up to (0, 0) - valid move (empty space)
2. Move down to (1, 1) - invalid move (wall)
3. Move left to (0, 0) - valid move (empty space)
4. Move right to (0, 2) - valid move (empty space)

Since moving up and left both lead to the same position (0, 0), we can choose either. Let's move to (0, 0).

Next move: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 0), let's examine the possible moves:

1. Move up to (-1, 0) - invalid move (out of bounds)
2. Move down to (1, 0) - invalid move (wall)
3. Move left to (0, -1) - invalid move (out of bounds)
4. Move right to (0, 1) - valid move (empty space)

The only valid move is to move right to (0, 1).

Next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems we have returned to a previous position without making progress towards the goal. Let's re-evaluate our strategy to find a more effective path.

From the current position (0, 1), let's consider the possible moves again:

1. Move up to (0, 0) - valid move (empty space)
2. Move down to (1, 1) - invalid move (wall)
3. Move left to (0, 0) - valid move (empty space)
4. Move right to (0, 2) - valid move (empty space)

Since moving up and left both lead to the same position (0, 0), and we have already been there, let's move right to (0, 2).

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze can be described as a "U-shape" or "horseshoe shape".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar U-shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze maintains the U-shape formed by the empty spaces and includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).
