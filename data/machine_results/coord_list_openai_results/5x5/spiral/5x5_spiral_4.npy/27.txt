You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (1, 0) to the goal position (4, 0) while avoiding walls and only moving through empty spaces. Let's use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path.

Here is the initial setup:
- Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1)
- Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- Player position: (1, 0)
- Goal: (4, 0)

We will start from the player position and explore all possible moves until we reach the goal.

1. Initialize the queue with the starting position and the path taken so far.
2. Dequeue the front of the queue.
3. Check if the current position is the goal.
4. If not, enqueue all valid moves (up, down, left, right) that lead to empty spaces and have not been visited yet.
5. Repeat until the goal is reached.

Let's find the next move:

1. Start at (1, 0).
2. Possible moves from (1, 0):
   - Up: (0, 0) (valid, empty)
   - Down: (2, 0) (valid, empty)
   - Left: (0, -1) (invalid, out of bounds)
   - Right: (1, 1) (invalid, wall)

The valid moves are (0, 0) and (2, 0). We will choose one of these moves. Let's choose (2, 0) as it brings us closer to the goal.

Next move: (2, 0)

Please update the maze with the new player position and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's continue solving the maze from the current player position (2, 0) to the goal position (4, 0).

1. Current position: (2, 0)
2. Possible moves from (2, 0):
   - Up: (1, 0) (valid, empty)
   - Down: (3, 0) (valid, empty)
   - Left: (2, -1) (invalid, out of bounds)
   - Right: (2, 1) (invalid, wall)

The valid moves are (1, 0) and (3, 0). We will choose (3, 0) as it brings us closer to the goal.

Next move: (3, 0)

Please update the maze with the new player position and provide the updated maze.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's continue solving the maze from the current player position (3, 0) to the goal position (4, 0).

1. Current position: (3, 0)
2. Possible moves from (3, 0):
   - Up: (2, 0) (valid, empty)
   - Down: (4, 0) (valid, empty, goal)
   - Left: (3, -1) (invalid, out of bounds)
   - Right: (3, 1) (invalid, wall)

The valid move is (4, 0), which is the goal position.

Next move: (4, 0)

Please update the maze with the new player position and confirm that the goal has been reached.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U" shape.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with empty spaces that form a "U" shape. The new maze includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze maintains the "U" shape of the empty spaces and provides a valid path from the player position to the goal position.
