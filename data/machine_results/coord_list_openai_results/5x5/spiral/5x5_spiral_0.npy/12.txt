You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position (4, 2) to the goal position (3, 0). We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the maze and find the shortest path.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize a queue with the starting position (4, 2).
2. Keep track of visited positions to avoid revisiting them.
3. For each position, explore its adjacent positions (up, down, left, right).
4. If an adjacent position is the goal, return the path.
5. If an adjacent position is an empty space and not visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.

Let's start with the initial position (4, 2):

1. Current position: (4, 2)
   - Possible moves: (3, 2), (5, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3)
   - Valid moves: (4, 1), (4, 3)

2. Move to (4, 1):
   - Possible moves: (3, 1), (5, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)
   - Valid moves: (4, 0), (4, 2)

3. Move to (4, 3):
   - Possible moves: (3, 3), (5, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4)
   - Valid moves: (4, 4), (4, 2)

4. Move to (4, 0):
   - Possible moves: (3, 0), (5, 0), (4, -1), (4, 1)
   - Valid moves: (3, 0) (Goal reached)

So, the next move from (4, 2) is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current player position (4, 1) and the goal position (3, 0), let's continue using the BFS algorithm to find the next move.

1. Current position: (4, 1)
   - Possible moves: (3, 1), (5, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2)
   - Valid moves: (4, 0), (4, 2)

2. Move to (4, 0):
   - Possible moves: (3, 0), (5, 0), (4, -1), (4, 1)
   - Valid moves: (3, 0) (Goal reached)

So, the next move from (4, 1) is to (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current player position (4, 0) and the goal position (3, 0), let's determine the next move.

1. Current position: (4, 0)
   - Possible moves: (3, 0), (5, 0), (4, -1), (4, 1)
   - Valid moves: (3, 0) (Goal reached)

So, the next move from (4, 0) is to (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze is a "U-shape".

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a U-shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

This new maze maintains the U-shape formed by the empty spaces and includes a valid path from the player position (4, 2) to the goal position (3, 0).
