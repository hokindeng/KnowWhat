You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the current player position (4, 2) to the goal position (3, 0). We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the maze and find the shortest path. Let's start by exploring the possible moves from the current position.

The current position is (4, 2). The possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 2)
- Down to (5, 2) (out of bounds, not valid)
- Left to (4, 1)
- Right to (4, 3)

From these moves, we need to check which ones are valid (i.e., they are within the maze bounds and are empty spaces).

- (3, 2) is a wall, so it's not valid.
- (4, 1) is an empty space, so it's valid.
- (4, 3) is an empty space, so it's valid.

We can move to either (4, 1) or (4, 3). Let's choose (4, 1) as the next move.

Next move: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current position is (4, 1). The possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 1) (wall, not valid)
- Down to (5, 1) (out of bounds, not valid)
- Left to (4, 0)
- Right to (4, 2)

From these moves, we need to check which ones are valid (i.e., they are within the maze bounds and are empty spaces).

- (3, 1) is a wall, so it's not valid.
- (4, 0) is an empty space, so it's valid.
- (4, 2) is an empty space, so it's valid.

We can move to either (4, 0) or (4, 2). Let's choose (4, 0) as the next move.

Next move: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current position is (4, 0). The possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 0)
- Down to (5, 0) (out of bounds, not valid)
- Left to (4, -1) (out of bounds, not valid)
- Right to (4, 1)

From these moves, we need to check which ones are valid (i.e., they are within the maze bounds and are empty spaces).

- (3, 0) is an empty space and is the goal position, so it's valid.
- (4, 1) is an empty space, but we have already visited it.

Since (3, 0) is the goal position and is a valid move, we should move there.

Next move: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze can be described as a "U-shape" or "horseshoe shape."

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with empty spaces that form a U-shape. The maze includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal position (G).

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 0)

This new maze maintains the U-shape formed by the empty spaces and provides a valid path from the player position to the goal position.
