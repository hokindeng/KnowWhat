You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position to the goal position by moving through empty spaces. Let's analyze the current situation:

- Current player position: (4, 1)
- Goal position: (2, 0)

The empty spaces available for movement are: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2).

From the current position (4, 1), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 1), but it's a wall.
- Down is not possible as it would go out of bounds.
- Left to (4, 0), which is an empty space.
- Right to (4, 2), which is an empty space.

To move towards the goal at (2, 0), let's move left to (4, 0).

The next move is to (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 0), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 0). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 0), which is an empty space.
- Down is not possible as it would go out of bounds.
- Left is not possible as it would go out of bounds.
- Right to (4, 1), which is an empty space.

To move closer to the goal at (2, 0), let's move up to (3, 0).

The next move is to (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 0), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 0). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (2, 0), which is the goal position.
- Down to (4, 0), which is an empty space.
- Left is not possible as it would go out of bounds.
- Right to (3, 1), but it's a wall.

Since moving up to (2, 0) will reach the goal, let's move up to (2, 0).

The next move is to (2, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape: "L-shape"**

The empty spaces in the original maze form an "L-shape" pattern, starting from the bottom row and moving up, then turning right.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with an "L-shape" path. We'll ensure that the path is not identical to the original but maintains the "L-shape" pattern.

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Empty:** (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
- **Player position:** (4, 0)
- **Goal:** (2, 2)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an "L-shape" starting from the bottom left, moving up, and then turning right. The player can navigate from the starting position (4, 0) to the goal (2, 2) by following the empty spaces.
