You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (4, 1) to the goal position (2, 0) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. From (4, 1), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (3, 1), which is a wall.
   - Down is out of bounds.
   - Left to (4, 0), which is an empty space.
   - Right to (4, 2), which is an empty space.

Since moving up is not possible due to a wall, and moving down is out of bounds, we have two options: move left to (4, 0) or right to (4, 2).

To get closer to the goal (2, 0), moving left to (4, 0) seems more promising because it aligns with the goal's row. Therefore, the next move should be to the left.

**Next move: (4, 0)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves to continue towards the goal (2, 0):

1. From (4, 0), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (3, 0), which is an empty space.
   - Down is out of bounds.
   - Left is out of bounds.
   - Right to (4, 1), which is an empty space.

To get closer to the goal (2, 0), moving up to (3, 0) is the best option as it brings us closer to the goal's row.

**Next move: (3, 0)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal (2, 0):

1. From (3, 0), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (2, 0), which is the goal position.
   - Down to (4, 0), which is an empty space.
   - Left is out of bounds.
   - Right to (3, 1), which is a wall.

The best move is to go up to (2, 0), which is the goal position.

**Next move: (2, 0)**

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "T" with an additional segment extending from the bottom of the "T". This can be described as a "T-shape" with a tail.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a "T-shape" path. The new maze will have a different configuration of walls and empty spaces but will maintain the "T-shape" path.

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)
- **Empty:** (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3)
- **Player position:** (4, 0)
- **Goal:** (2, 3)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a "T-shape" with a tail, similar to the original maze. The player can navigate from the starting position (4, 0) to the goal (2, 3) by following the empty spaces.
