You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (4, 1) to the goal position (2, 0) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (4, 1)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (3, 1): This is a wall, so it's not possible.
   - Down to (5, 1): This is outside the given grid, so it's not possible.
   - Left to (4, 0): This is an empty space, so it's possible.
   - Right to (4, 2): This is an empty space, so it's possible.

Given the options, we can move to either (4, 0) or (4, 2). To make progress towards the goal (2, 0), moving to (4, 2) seems more promising as it keeps us closer to the path leading upwards.

**Next Move**: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (4, 2)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (3, 2): This is a wall, so it's not possible.
   - Down to (5, 2): This is outside the given grid, so it's not possible.
   - Left to (4, 1): This is an empty space, so it's possible.
   - Right to (4, 3): This is a wall, so it's not possible.

The only valid move is to go left to (4, 1).

**Next Move**: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves again:

1. **Current Position**: (4, 1)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (3, 1): This is a wall, so it's not possible.
   - Down to (5, 1): This is outside the given grid, so it's not possible.
   - Left to (4, 0): This is an empty space, so it's possible.
   - Right to (4, 2): This is an empty space, so it's possible.

To make progress towards the goal (2, 0), let's move to (4, 0), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the path leading upwards.

**Next Move**: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (4, 0)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (3, 0): This is an empty space, so it's possible.
   - Down to (5, 0): This is outside the given grid, so it's not possible.
   - Left to (4, -1): This is outside the given grid, so it's not possible.
   - Right to (4, 1): This is an empty space, so it's possible.

To make progress towards the goal (2, 0), moving up to (3, 0) is the best option.

**Next Move**: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (3, 0)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (2, 0): This is the goal position, so it's possible and desirable.
   - Down to (4, 0): This is an empty space, but moving back doesn't help us reach the goal.
   - Left to (3, -1): This is outside the given grid, so it's not possible.
   - Right to (3, 1): This is a wall, so it's not possible.

The best move is to go up to (2, 0), which is the goal position.

**Next Move**: (2, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape**: The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape resembling a "T" with a vertical path leading up and a horizontal path branching to the right.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape**:

Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a "T" shape formed by the empty spaces. We'll ensure there's a valid path from the player position to the goal.

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Empty**: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)
- **Player position**: (4, 2)
- **Goal**: (3, 0)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a "T" shape, with a vertical path leading up from (4, 0) to (2, 0) and a horizontal path branching to the right at (2, 1) and (2, 2). The player can move from (4, 2) to the goal at (3, 0) by following the empty spaces.
