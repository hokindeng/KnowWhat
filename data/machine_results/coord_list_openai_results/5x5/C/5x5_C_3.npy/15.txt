You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position at (4, 1) to the goal position at (2, 0) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position:

- Current position: (4, 1)
- Possible moves from (4, 1):
  - Up to (3, 1) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
  - Down to (5, 1) - This is outside the given grid, so it's not possible.
  - Left to (4, 0) - This is an empty space, so it's possible.
  - Right to (4, 2) - This is an empty space, so it's possible.

Given these options, we can move to either (4, 0) or (4, 2). To make progress towards the goal at (2, 0), let's move to (4, 2).

Next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (4, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Current position: (4, 2)
- Possible moves from (4, 2):
  - Up to (3, 2) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.
  - Down to (5, 2) - This is outside the given grid, so it's not possible.
  - Left to (4, 1) - This is an empty space, so it's possible.
  - Right to (4, 3) - This is a wall, so it's not possible.

The only valid move is to go left to (4, 1). However, since we have already been at (4, 1), let's consider the path towards the goal:

To make progress towards the goal at (2, 0), we should move to (4, 0), which is an empty space and will bring us closer to the goal.

Next move: (4, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "T" shape. The empty spaces are arranged in a way that forms a vertical line with a horizontal line intersecting it, similar to the letter "T".

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a "T" shape:

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Empty**: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
- **Player position**: (4, 1)
- **Goal**: (3, 0)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a "T" shape, with the vertical part of the "T" being the path from (4, 0) to (2, 2) and the horizontal part being from (2, 1) to (2, 2). The player can navigate from the starting position (4, 1) to the goal (3, 0) through the empty spaces.
