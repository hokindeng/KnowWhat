You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (4, 1) to the goal at (2, 0) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. From (4, 1), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (3, 1), but (3, 1) is a wall.
   - Down is out of bounds.
   - Left to (4, 0), which is an empty space.
   - Right to (4, 2), which is an empty space.

Given these options, let's move to (4, 2) as it seems to be a step towards the goal.

The next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (3, 2), but (3, 2) is a wall.
2. Down is out of bounds.
3. Left to (4, 1), which is an empty space.
4. Right to (4, 3), but (4, 3) is a wall.

The only viable move is to go back to (4, 1). However, to make progress towards the goal, let's consider moving to (4, 0) from (4, 1) in the next step.

For now, move to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves again:

1. Up to (3, 1), but (3, 1) is a wall.
2. Down is out of bounds.
3. Left to (4, 0), which is an empty space.
4. Right to (4, 2), which is an empty space.

To make progress towards the goal, let's move to (4, 0).

The next move is to (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (3, 0), which is an empty space.
2. Down is out of bounds.
3. Left is out of bounds.
4. Right to (4, 1), which is an empty space.

To make progress towards the goal, let's move up to (3, 0).

The next move is to (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (2, 0), which is the goal position.
2. Down to (4, 0), which is an empty space.
3. Left is out of bounds.
4. Right to (3, 1), but (3, 1) is a wall.

Since moving up to (2, 0) will reach the goal, let's make that move.

The next move is to (2, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "T" or a "cross" with a vertical and horizontal component.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a "T" shape formed by the empty spaces. The new maze will have a different configuration but maintain the "T" shape.

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Empty:** (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0)
- **Player position:** (3, 0)
- **Goal:** (1, 2)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a "T" shape, with the vertical part of the "T" running from (3, 0) to (1, 2) and the horizontal part at (2, 0), (2, 1), and (2, 2). The player can move from (3, 0) to the goal at (1, 2) by following the empty spaces.
