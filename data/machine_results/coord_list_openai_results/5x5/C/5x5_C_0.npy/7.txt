You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position to the goal position by moving through empty spaces and avoiding walls. The player's current position is (0, 2), and the goal is at (3, 0).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (0, 2):

1. **Up**: (0, 2) -> (-1, 2) (out of bounds, not possible)
2. **Down**: (0, 2) -> (1, 2) (wall, not possible)
3. **Left**: (0, 2) -> (0, 1) (empty, possible)
4. **Right**: (0, 2) -> (0, 3) (empty, possible)

From (0, 2), we can move either left to (0, 1) or right to (0, 3). To make progress towards the goal at (3, 0), moving right to (0, 3) seems like a better choice because it keeps us on a path that can eventually lead downwards towards the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (0, 3) -> (-1, 3) (out of bounds, not possible)
2. **Down**: (0, 3) -> (1, 3) (wall, not possible)
3. **Left**: (0, 3) -> (0, 2) (empty, possible)
4. **Right**: (0, 3) -> (0, 4) (wall, not possible)

The only possible move from (0, 3) is to move left to (0, 2). However, since we have already been at (0, 2), we need to find a new path. Let's backtrack to (0, 2) and then explore other options from there.

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves again:

1. **Up**: (0, 2) -> (-1, 2) (out of bounds, not possible)
2. **Down**: (0, 2) -> (1, 2) (wall, not possible)
3. **Left**: (0, 2) -> (0, 1) (empty, possible)
4. **Right**: (0, 2) -> (0, 3) (empty, possible)

Previously, we moved to (0, 3) and found it led to a dead end. Let's try moving left to (0, 1) this time, as it might open up a new path towards the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (0, 1) -> (-1, 1) (out of bounds, not possible)
2. **Down**: (0, 1) -> (1, 1) (wall, not possible)
3. **Left**: (0, 1) -> (0, 0) (empty, possible)
4. **Right**: (0, 1) -> (0, 2) (empty, possible)

The move to the left, (0, 0), is a new path that could potentially lead us towards the goal. Let's move to (0, 0).

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (0, 0) -> (-1, 0) (out of bounds, not possible)
2. **Down**: (0, 0) -> (1, 0) (empty, possible)
3. **Left**: (0, 0) -> (-1, 0) (out of bounds, not possible)
4. **Right**: (0, 0) -> (0, 1) (empty, possible)

Moving down to (1, 0) is a new path that brings us closer to the goal at (3, 0). Let's move to (1, 0).

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (1, 0) -> (0, 0) (empty, possible)
2. **Down**: (1, 0) -> (2, 0) (empty, possible)
3. **Left**: (1, 0) -> (1, -1) (out of bounds, not possible)
4. **Right**: (1, 0) -> (1, 1) (wall, not possible)

Moving down to (2, 0) is a new path that continues to bring us closer to the goal at (3, 0). Let's move to (2, 0).

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (2, 0) -> (1, 0) (empty, possible)
2. **Down**: (2, 0) -> (3, 0) (empty, possible)
3. **Left**: (2, 0) -> (2, -1) (out of bounds, not possible)
4. **Right**: (2, 0) -> (2, 1) (wall, not possible)

Moving down to (3, 0) will take us directly to the goal position. Let's move to (3, 0).

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "U" shape. The path starts at the top left, goes down the left side, and then moves across the bottom row.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a "U" shape:

- **Walls**: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Empty**: (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)
- **Player position**: (0, 0)
- **Goal**: (2, 3)

This new maze maintains the "U" shape of the empty spaces, with a path that starts at the top left, goes down the left side, and then moves across the bottom row to reach the goal.
