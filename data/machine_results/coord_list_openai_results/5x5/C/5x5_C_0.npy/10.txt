You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position to the goal position by moving through empty spaces. The player's current position is (0, 2), and the goal is at (3, 0). We can move up, down, left, or right to adjacent empty spaces.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (0, 2):

1. **Up**: (0, 2) -> (0, 1) is an empty space.
2. **Down**: (0, 2) -> (1, 2) is a wall.
3. **Left**: (0, 2) -> (0, 1) is an empty space.
4. **Right**: (0, 2) -> (0, 3) is an empty space.

From (0, 2), we can move to (0, 1) or (0, 3). To make progress towards the goal at (3, 0), moving to (0, 3) seems more promising as it keeps us moving towards the right direction.

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (0, 3) -> (0, 2) is an empty space.
2. **Down**: (0, 3) -> (1, 3) is a wall.
3. **Left**: (0, 3) -> (0, 2) is an empty space.
4. **Right**: (0, 3) -> (0, 4) is a wall.

The only valid move from (0, 3) is to go back to (0, 2), but that doesn't help us progress towards the goal. Instead, let's consider moving down the column by first moving left to (0, 2), then down to (1, 0), and so on.

To make progress, let's move left to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves again:

1. **Up**: (0, 2) -> (0, 1) is an empty space.
2. **Down**: (0, 2) -> (1, 2) is a wall.
3. **Left**: (0, 2) -> (0, 1) is an empty space.
4. **Right**: (0, 2) -> (0, 3) is an empty space.

To make progress towards the goal at (3, 0), we should move towards the bottom of the grid. The best move from (0, 2) is to go left to (0, 1), which will allow us to move down the column in subsequent steps.

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (0, 1) -> (0, 0) is an empty space.
2. **Down**: (0, 1) -> (1, 1) is a wall.
3. **Left**: (0, 1) -> (0, 0) is an empty space.
4. **Right**: (0, 1) -> (0, 2) is an empty space.

To make progress towards the goal at (3, 0), we should move down the column. The best move from (0, 1) is to go left to (0, 0), which will allow us to move down the column in subsequent steps.

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (0, 0) is at the top edge, so moving up is not possible.
2. **Down**: (0, 0) -> (1, 0) is an empty space.
3. **Left**: (0, 0) is at the left edge, so moving left is not possible.
4. **Right**: (0, 0) -> (0, 1) is an empty space.

To make progress towards the goal at (3, 0), we should move down the column. The best move from (0, 0) is to go down to (1, 0).

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (1, 0) -> (0, 0) is an empty space.
2. **Down**: (1, 0) -> (2, 0) is an empty space.
3. **Left**: (1, 0) is at the left edge, so moving left is not possible.
4. **Right**: (1, 0) -> (1, 1) is a wall.

To make progress towards the goal at (3, 0), we should continue moving down the column. The best move from (1, 0) is to go down to (2, 0).

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (2, 0) -> (1, 0) is an empty space.
2. **Down**: (2, 0) -> (3, 0) is the goal position.
3. **Left**: (2, 0) is at the left edge, so moving left is not possible.
4. **Right**: (2, 0) -> (2, 1) is a wall.

The goal position (3, 0) is directly below the current position. Therefore, the best move is to go down to (3, 0).

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "U" shape. The path starts at the top left, goes down the left side, and then moves across the bottom row.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a "U" shape:

- **Walls**: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Empty**: (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)
- **Player position**: (0, 0)
- **Goal**: (3, 3)

This new maze maintains the "U" shape by having the path start at the top left, go down the left side, and then move across the middle row. The player can navigate from the starting position (0, 0) to the goal (3, 3) by following the empty spaces.
