You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (0, 2) to the goal at (3, 0) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. From (0, 2), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (0, 1) (empty space)
   - Down to (1, 2) (wall, not possible)
   - Left to (0, 1) (empty space)
   - Right to (0, 3) (empty space)

Given these options, moving right to (0, 3) seems like a good choice to progress towards the goal. 

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (0, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (0, 2) (empty space)
2. Down to (1, 3) (wall, not possible)
3. Left to (0, 2) (empty space)
4. Right to (0, 4) (wall, not possible)

The only viable moves are to go up to (0, 2) or left to (0, 2). However, since we have already been at (0, 2), let's consider moving back to (0, 2) and then explore other paths from there.

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (0, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves again:

1. Up to (0, 1) (empty space)
2. Down to (1, 2) (wall, not possible)
3. Left to (0, 1) (empty space)
4. Right to (0, 3) (empty space)

Since moving right to (0, 3) did not lead us closer to the goal, let's try moving left to (0, 1) to explore a different path.

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (0, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (0, 0) (empty space)
2. Down to (1, 1) (wall, not possible)
3. Left to (0, 0) (empty space)
4. Right to (0, 2) (empty space)

Moving left to (0, 0) seems like a good option to continue exploring towards the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (0, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up is not possible as it would go out of bounds.
2. Down to (1, 0) (empty space)
3. Left is not possible as it would go out of bounds.
4. Right to (0, 1) (empty space)

Moving down to (1, 0) is a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (1, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (0, 0) (empty space)
2. Down to (2, 0) (empty space)
3. Left is not possible as it would go out of bounds.
4. Right to (1, 1) (wall, not possible)

Moving down to (2, 0) is a good choice as it continues to bring us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (2, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (1, 0) (empty space)
2. Down to (3, 0) (goal position)
3. Left is not possible as it would go out of bounds.
4. Right to (2, 1) (wall, not possible)

Moving down to (3, 0) will reach the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape resembling the letter "C". The path starts at the top left, goes down the left side, and then moves right along the bottom row.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a "C" shape formed by the empty spaces. The player position (P) and goal (G) will be placed to ensure a valid path.

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Empty:** (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)
- **Player position:** (0, 4)
- **Goal:** (4, 0)

This new maze maintains the "C" shape of the empty spaces, starting from the top right, moving down the right side, and then left along the bottom row.
