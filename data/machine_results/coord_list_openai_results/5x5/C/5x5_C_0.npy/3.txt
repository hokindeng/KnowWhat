You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (0, 2) to the goal position (3, 0) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position:

1. **Current Position**: (0, 2)
   - **Possible Moves**:
     - Up: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
     - Down: (1, 2) (This is a wall)
     - Left: (0, 1) (This is an empty space)
     - Right: (0, 3) (This is an empty space)

From (0, 2), we can move either left to (0, 1) or right to (0, 3). To make progress towards the goal at (3, 0), moving right to (0, 3) seems more promising as it keeps us on the path towards the goal.

**Next Move**: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (0, 3)
   - **Possible Moves**:
     - Up: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
     - Down: (1, 3) (This is a wall)
     - Left: (0, 2) (This is an empty space)
     - Right: (0, 4) (This is a wall)

The only available move from (0, 3) is to go left to (0, 2). However, since we have already been at (0, 2), we need to find a new path. Let's backtrack to (0, 2) and then explore other options from there.

**Next Move**: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), let's re-evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (0, 2)
   - **Possible Moves**:
     - Up: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
     - Down: (1, 2) (This is a wall)
     - Left: (0, 1) (This is an empty space)
     - Right: (0, 3) (This is an empty space, but we've already been there)

Since moving right to (0, 3) didn't lead us to a new path, let's try moving left to (0, 1) to explore a different route.

**Next Move**: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (0, 1)
   - **Possible Moves**:
     - Up: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
     - Down: (1, 1) (This is a wall)
     - Left: (0, 0) (This is an empty space)
     - Right: (0, 2) (This is an empty space, but we've already been there)

The only new move from (0, 1) is to go left to (0, 0).

**Next Move**: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (0, 0)
   - **Possible Moves**:
     - Up: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
     - Down: (1, 0) (This is an empty space)
     - Left: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
     - Right: (0, 1) (This is an empty space, but we've already been there)

The best move from (0, 0) is to go down to (1, 0), which is an empty space and moves us closer to the goal.

**Next Move**: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)

Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 0)
   - **Possible Moves**:
     - Up: (0, 0) (This is an empty space, but we've already been there)
     - Down: (2, 0) (This is an empty space)
     - Left: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
     - Right: (1, 1) (This is a wall)

The best move from (1, 0) is to go down to (2, 0), which is an empty space and continues to move us towards the goal.

**Next Move**: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)

Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (2, 0)
   - **Possible Moves**:
     - Up: (1, 0) (This is an empty space, but we've already been there)
     - Down: (3, 0) (This is the goal position)
     - Left: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)

The best move from (2, 0) is to go down to (3, 0), which is the goal position.

**Next Move**: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "U" shape. The path starts at the top left, goes down the left side, and then moves across the bottom row.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a "U" shape:

- **Walls**: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Empty**: (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)
- **Player position**: (0, 0)
- **Goal**: (3, 3)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a "U" shape, starting from the top left, going down the left side, and then moving across the middle row. The player can navigate from the starting position (0, 0) to the goal (3, 3) by following the empty spaces.
