You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position to the goal position by moving through empty spaces. The player's current position is (0, 2), and the goal is at (3, 0). We can move up, down, left, or right to adjacent empty spaces.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (0, 2):

1. **Up**: (0, 2) -> (0, 1) is an empty space.
2. **Down**: (0, 2) -> (1, 2) is a wall.
3. **Left**: (0, 2) -> (0, 1) is an empty space.
4. **Right**: (0, 2) -> (0, 3) is an empty space.

From (0, 2), we can move to (0, 1) or (0, 3). Moving to (0, 3) seems to be a more promising path towards the goal at (3, 0).

Let's move to (0, 3).

**Next move: (0, 3)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (0, 3) -> (0, 2) is an empty space.
2. **Down**: (0, 3) -> (1, 3) is a wall.
3. **Left**: (0, 3) -> (0, 2) is an empty space.
4. **Right**: (0, 3) -> (0, 4) is a wall.

The only valid move from (0, 3) is to go back to (0, 2), which doesn't help us progress towards the goal. Let's consider moving to (0, 2) and then exploring other paths from there.

**Next move: (0, 2)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves again:

1. **Up**: (0, 2) -> (0, 1) is an empty space.
2. **Down**: (0, 2) -> (1, 2) is a wall.
3. **Left**: (0, 2) -> (0, 1) is an empty space.
4. **Right**: (0, 2) -> (0, 3) is an empty space.

Since moving to (0, 3) didn't help us progress towards the goal, let's try moving to (0, 1) this time, which might open up a new path.

**Next move: (0, 1)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (0, 1) -> (0, 0) is an empty space.
2. **Down**: (0, 1) -> (1, 1) is a wall.
3. **Left**: (0, 1) -> (0, 0) is an empty space.
4. **Right**: (0, 1) -> (0, 2) is an empty space.

Moving to (0, 0) seems like a good option as it leads us closer to the goal at (3, 0).

**Next move: (0, 0)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (0, 0) is at the top edge, so moving up is not possible.
2. **Down**: (0, 0) -> (1, 0) is an empty space.
3. **Left**: (0, 0) is at the left edge, so moving left is not possible.
4. **Right**: (0, 0) -> (0, 1) is an empty space.

Moving down to (1, 0) seems like a good option as it continues to lead us towards the goal at (3, 0).

**Next move: (1, 0)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (1, 0) -> (0, 0) is an empty space.
2. **Down**: (1, 0) -> (2, 0) is an empty space.
3. **Left**: (1, 0) is at the left edge, so moving left is not possible.
4. **Right**: (1, 0) -> (1, 1) is a wall.

Moving down to (2, 0) is a good option as it continues to lead us towards the goal at (3, 0).

**Next move: (2, 0)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (2, 0) -> (1, 0) is an empty space.
2. **Down**: (2, 0) -> (3, 0) is the goal position.
3. **Left**: (2, 0) is at the left edge, so moving left is not possible.
4. **Right**: (2, 0) -> (2, 1) is a wall.

Moving down to (3, 0) will take us directly to the goal.

**Next move: (3, 0)**

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape resembling the letter "C". The path starts at the top left, goes down the left side, and then turns right at the bottom, forming a "C" shape.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a "C" shape formed by the empty spaces. We'll ensure there's a valid path from the player position to the goal.

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1)
- **Empty:** (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)
- **Player position:** (0, 2)
- **Goal:** (3, 0)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a "C" shape, starting from the top and going down the left side, then turning right at the bottom. The player can navigate from the starting position (0, 2) to the goal (3, 0) by following the empty spaces.
