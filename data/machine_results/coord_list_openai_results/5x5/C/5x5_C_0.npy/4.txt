You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (0, 2) to the goal position (3, 0) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position:

Current position: (0, 2)

Possible moves:
- Up: (0, 2) -> Not possible, as it would go out of bounds.
- Down: (1, 2) -> Not possible, as it is a wall.
- Left: (0, 1) -> Possible, as it is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 3) -> Possible, as it is an empty space.

To make progress towards the goal, let's move to the right to (0, 3).

Next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

Current position: (0, 3)

Possible moves:
- Up: (0, 3) -> Not possible, as it would go out of bounds.
- Down: (1, 3) -> Not possible, as it is a wall.
- Left: (0, 2) -> Possible, as it is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 4) -> Not possible, as it is a wall.

The only possible move is to go left to (0, 2). However, since we have already been at (0, 2), let's consider a different path to make progress towards the goal. We should backtrack to (0, 2) and then move to (0, 1) to explore a new path.

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves again:

Current position: (0, 2)

Possible moves:
- Up: (0, 2) -> Not possible, as it would go out of bounds.
- Down: (1, 2) -> Not possible, as it is a wall.
- Left: (0, 1) -> Possible, as it is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 3) -> Possible, as it is an empty space.

To explore a new path towards the goal, let's move left to (0, 1).

Next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

Current position: (0, 1)

Possible moves:
- Up: (0, 1) -> Not possible, as it would go out of bounds.
- Down: (1, 1) -> Not possible, as it is a wall.
- Left: (0, 0) -> Possible, as it is an empty space.
- Right: (0, 2) -> Possible, as it is an empty space.

To continue making progress towards the goal, let's move left to (0, 0).

Next move: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

Current position: (0, 0)

Possible moves:
- Up: (0, 0) -> Not possible, as it would go out of bounds.
- Down: (1, 0) -> Possible, as it is an empty space.
- Left: (0, 0) -> Not possible, as it would go out of bounds.
- Right: (0, 1) -> Possible, as it is an empty space.

To make progress towards the goal, let's move down to (1, 0).

Next move: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

Current position: (1, 0)

Possible moves:
- Up: (0, 0) -> Possible, as it is an empty space.
- Down: (2, 0) -> Possible, as it is an empty space.
- Left: (1, 0) -> Not possible, as it would go out of bounds.
- Right: (1, 1) -> Not possible, as it is a wall.

To continue making progress towards the goal, let's move down to (2, 0).

Next move: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

Current position: (2, 0)

Possible moves:
- Up: (1, 0) -> Possible, as it is an empty space.
- Down: (3, 0) -> Possible, as it is the goal position.
- Left: (2, 0) -> Not possible, as it would go out of bounds.
- Right: (2, 1) -> Not possible, as it is a wall.

Since moving down to (3, 0) will take us directly to the goal, let's make that move.

Next move: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "U" shape. The path starts at the top left, goes down the left side, and then moves across the bottom row.

2. Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a "U" shape:

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1)
- **Empty:** (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
- **Player position:** (1, 0)
- **Goal:** (3, 3)

This new maze maintains the "U" shape of the empty spaces, starting from the player position at (1, 0), moving down the left side, and then across the bottom row to reach the goal at (3, 3).
