You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (0, 2) to the goal position (3, 0) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (0, 2)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
   - Down: (1, 2) (This is a wall)
   - Left: (0, 1) (This is an empty space)
   - Right: (0, 3) (This is an empty space)

From (0, 2), we can move either left to (0, 1) or right to (0, 3). To make progress towards the goal at (3, 0), moving right to (0, 3) seems more promising as it keeps us on the path towards the goal.

**Next Move**: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (0, 3)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
   - Down: (1, 3) (This is a wall)
   - Left: (0, 2) (This is an empty space)
   - Right: (0, 4) (This is a wall)

The only valid move from (0, 3) is to move left to (0, 2), which is an empty space. However, since we have already been at (0, 2), let's consider the overall path to the goal. We need to backtrack to find a new path.

**Next Move**: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves again:

1. **Current Position**: (0, 2)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
   - Down: (1, 2) (This is a wall)
   - Left: (0, 1) (This is an empty space)
   - Right: (0, 3) (This is an empty space)

Since moving right to (0, 3) leads us back to a dead end, let's try moving left to (0, 1) to explore a different path.

**Next Move**: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (0, 1)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
   - Down: (1, 1) (This is a wall)
   - Left: (0, 0) (This is an empty space)
   - Right: (0, 2) (This is an empty space)

To make progress towards the goal at (3, 0), let's move left to (0, 0), which is an empty space and a new path to explore.

**Next Move**: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (0, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (0, 0)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
   - Down: (1, 0) (This is an empty space)
   - Left: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
   - Right: (0, 1) (This is an empty space)

To make progress towards the goal at (3, 0), let's move down to (1, 0), which is an empty space and moves us closer to the goal.

**Next Move**: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 0)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up: (0, 0) (This is an empty space)
   - Down: (2, 0) (This is an empty space)
   - Left: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
   - Right: (1, 1) (This is a wall)

To continue making progress towards the goal at (3, 0), let's move down to (2, 0), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

**Next Move**: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (2, 0)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up: (1, 0) (This is an empty space)
   - Down: (3, 0) (This is the goal position)
   - Left: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
   - Right: (2, 1) (This is a wall)

Since moving down to (3, 0) will take us directly to the goal, let's make that move.

**Next Move**: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "U" or a "C" shape. The path starts at the top left, goes down the left side, and then moves to the right at the bottom, forming a "U" shape.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a "U" shape formed by the empty spaces. We'll ensure that there is a valid path from the player position to the goal.

**New Maze Configuration:**

- **Walls**: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1)
- **Empty**: (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
- **Player Position**: (0, 0)
- **Goal**: (3, 3)

This new maze maintains the "U" shape of the empty spaces, with a path that starts at the top left, goes down the left side, and then moves to the right at the bottom to reach the goal.
