You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player position at (4, 1) to the goal at (0, 1) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (4, 1)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (3, 1): This is a wall, so it's not possible.
   - Down to (5, 1): This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.
   - Left to (4, 0): This is an empty space, so it's possible.
   - Right to (4, 2): This is an empty space, so it's possible.

Given the options, we can move to either (4, 0) or (4, 2). To progress towards the goal at (0, 1), moving to (4, 2) seems more promising as it keeps us closer to the path leading upwards.

**Next Move**: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (4, 2)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (3, 2): This is a wall, so it's not possible.
   - Down to (5, 2): This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.
   - Left to (4, 1): This is an empty space, so it's possible.
   - Right to (4, 3): This is an empty space, so it's possible.

To continue progressing towards the goal at (0, 1), moving to (4, 3) keeps us on the path that can eventually lead upwards.

**Next Move**: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (4, 3)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (3, 3): This is a wall, so it's not possible.
   - Down to (5, 3): This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.
   - Left to (4, 2): This is an empty space, so it's possible.
   - Right to (4, 4): This is an empty space, so it's possible.

To continue progressing towards the goal at (0, 1), moving to (4, 4) keeps us on the path that can eventually lead upwards.

**Next Move**: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (4, 4)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (3, 4): This is a wall, so it's not possible.
   - Down to (5, 4): This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.
   - Left to (4, 3): This is an empty space, so it's possible.
   - Right to (4, 5): This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.

The only possible move is to go back to (4, 3). However, to make progress towards the goal, we need to find a path that leads upwards. Let's backtrack to (4, 3) and then explore other options.

**Next Move**: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves again:

1. **Current Position**: (4, 3)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (3, 3): This is a wall, so it's not possible.
   - Down to (5, 3): This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.
   - Left to (4, 2): This is an empty space, so it's possible.
   - Right to (4, 4): This is an empty space, but we've already been there and it doesn't lead to the goal.

To make progress towards the goal, we should try a different path. Let's move left to (4, 2) and explore from there.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape**: The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape resembling the letter "U". The path starts at the bottom, goes up along the left side, and then moves across the top.

2. **New Maze**: Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a "U" shape. The maze is encoded with walls, empty spaces, a player position, and a goal position.

- **Walls**: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
- **Empty**: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Player position**: (4, 4)
- **Goal**: (0, 4)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a "U" shape, but the configuration of walls and empty spaces is different from the original maze. The player can navigate from the starting position (4, 4) to the goal (0, 4) by moving through the empty spaces.
