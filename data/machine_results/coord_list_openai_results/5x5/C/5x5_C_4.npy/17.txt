You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (4, 1) to the goal at (0, 1), moving only through empty spaces and avoiding walls. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (4, 1)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (3, 1): This is a wall, so it's not possible.
   - Down to (5, 1): This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.
   - Left to (4, 0): This is an empty space, so it's possible.
   - Right to (4, 2): This is an empty space, so it's possible.

Given the options, moving to (4, 0) or (4, 2) are both valid. However, moving to (4, 2) seems to be a more direct path towards the goal. Therefore, the next move should be to (4, 2).

**Next Move**: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Now that the player is at position (4, 2), let's determine the next move towards the goal at (0, 1).

1. **Current Position**: (4, 2)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (3, 2): This is a wall, so it's not possible.
   - Down to (5, 2): This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.
   - Left to (4, 1): This is an empty space, and we just came from there.
   - Right to (4, 3): This is an empty space, so it's possible.

Moving to (4, 3) is a valid move and continues to progress towards the goal. Therefore, the next move should be to (4, 3).

**Next Move**: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is now at position (4, 3). Let's determine the next move towards the goal at (0, 1).

1. **Current Position**: (4, 3)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (3, 3): This is a wall, so it's not possible.
   - Down to (5, 3): This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.
   - Left to (4, 2): This is an empty space, and we just came from there.
   - Right to (4, 4): This is an empty space, so it's possible.

Moving to (4, 4) is a valid move and continues to progress towards the goal. Therefore, the next move should be to (4, 4).

**Next Move**: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is now at position (4, 4). Let's determine the next move towards the goal at (0, 1).

1. **Current Position**: (4, 4)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (3, 4): This is a wall, so it's not possible.
   - Down to (5, 4): This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.
   - Left to (4, 3): This is an empty space, and we just came from there.
   - Right to (4, 5): This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.

The only valid move is to go back to (4, 3). Let's backtrack and try a different path.

**Next Move**: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is back at position (4, 3). Let's explore a different path to reach the goal at (0, 1).

1. **Current Position**: (4, 3)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (3, 3): This is a wall, so it's not possible.
   - Down to (5, 3): This is outside the grid, so it's not possible.
   - Left to (4, 2): This is an empty space, and we can move there.
   - Right to (4, 4): This is an empty space, but we just came from there.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape**: The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape resembling a "U" or a "C" shape, with the open end facing upwards. The path starts at the bottom, goes up the left side, and then moves across the top.

2. **New Maze**: Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a similar "U" or "C" shape formed by the empty spaces. The new maze will have a valid path from the player position to the goal.

   - **Walls**: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
   - **Empty**: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
   - **Player position**: (4, 4)
   - **Goal**: (0, 4)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a similar "U" or "C" shape, with the path starting at the bottom right, moving up the right side, and then across the top to reach the goal.
