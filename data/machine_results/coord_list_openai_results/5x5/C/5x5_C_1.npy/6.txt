You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (3, 1) to the goal at (1, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (3, 1)

   From (3, 1), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (2, 1)
   - Down to (4, 1)

   Moving left or right is not possible because (3, 0) and (3, 2) are walls.

2. **Choosing the Next Move**:

   To get closer to the goal at (1, 3), we should move towards the goal. Moving up to (2, 1) is a step in the right direction.

Therefore, the next move is to go **up** to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 1), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (2, 1)

   From (2, 1), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (1, 1)
   - Down to (3, 1)

   Moving left or right is not possible because (2, 0) is a wall and (2, 2) is also a wall.

2. **Choosing the Next Move**:

   Moving up to (1, 1) is a step closer to the goal at (1, 3).

Therefore, the next move is to go **up** to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 1), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 1)

   From (1, 1), the possible moves are:
   - Right to (1, 2)
   - Down to (2, 1)

   Moving up or left is not possible because (0, 1) is a wall and (1, 0) is also a wall.

2. **Choosing the Next Move**:

   Moving right to (1, 2) is a step closer to the goal at (1, 3).

Therefore, the next move is to go **right** to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 2), we need to move to the goal at (1, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 2)

   From (1, 2), the possible moves are:
   - Right to (1, 3) (which is the goal)
   - Left to (1, 1)

   Moving up or down is not possible because (0, 2) is a wall and (2, 2) is also a wall.

2. **Choosing the Next Move**:

   Moving right to (1, 3) will reach the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to go **right** to (1, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape**: The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "T" with an additional branch. The path starts at the bottom of the "T" and extends upwards, then branches to the right.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape**:

   Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a similar "T" shape for the empty spaces, ensuring a valid path from the player position to the goal.

   - **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
   - **Empty**: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)
   - **Player position**: (4, 2)
   - **Goal**: (1, 3)

   In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a "T" shape, with the player starting at the bottom of the "T" and the goal at the right end of the top of the "T". The path is different from the original but maintains the same general shape.
