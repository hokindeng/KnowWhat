You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (3, 1) to the goal position at (1, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (3, 1)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (2, 1) - This is an empty space.
   - Down to (4, 1) - This is an empty space.
   - Left to (3, 0) - This is a wall.
   - Right to (3, 2) - This is a wall.

Given these options, moving up to (2, 1) seems like a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal. Therefore, the next move should be:

**Move to (2, 1)**.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the player now at position (2, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (2, 1)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (1, 1) - This is an empty space.
   - Down to (3, 1) - This is an empty space.
   - Left to (2, 0) - This is a wall.
   - Right to (2, 2) - This is a wall.

Moving up to (1, 1) is a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal at (1, 3). Therefore, the next move should be:

**Move to (1, 1)**.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the player now at position (1, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 1)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (0, 1) - This is a wall.
   - Down to (2, 1) - This is an empty space.
   - Left to (1, 0) - This is a wall.
   - Right to (1, 2) - This is an empty space.

Moving right to (1, 2) is a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal at (1, 3). Therefore, the next move should be:

**Move to (1, 2)**.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.With the player now at position (1, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 2)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (0, 2) - This is a wall.
   - Down to (2, 2) - This is a wall.
   - Left to (1, 1) - This is an empty space.
   - Right to (1, 3) - This is the goal position.

Moving right to (1, 3) will take us directly to the goal. Therefore, the next move should be:

**Move to (1, 3)**.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces**: The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "T" or "cross" shape. The path starts at the bottom of the "T" and moves up, then branches to the right to reach the goal.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape**:

Let's create a new maze of the same size (5x5 grid) with a "T" shape formed by the empty spaces. The new maze will have a different configuration of walls and empty spaces but will maintain the "T" shape.

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
- **Empty**: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)
- **Player position**: (4, 1)
- **Goal**: (1, 3)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a "T" shape, with the player starting at the bottom of the "T" and the goal at the right end of the top of the "T".
