You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (3, 1) to the goal position at (1, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. From (3, 1), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (2, 1)
   - Down to (4, 1)

2. From (2, 1), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (1, 1)

3. From (1, 1), the possible moves are:
   - Right to (1, 2)

4. From (1, 2), the possible moves are:
   - Right to (1, 3) (which is the goal)

Following this path, the first move from the current position (3, 1) should be up to (2, 1).

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (2, 1), let's determine the next move to continue towards the goal at (1, 3):

1. From (2, 1), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (1, 1)
   - Down to (3, 1)

Since we are trying to reach the goal at (1, 3), moving up to (1, 1) is the best option as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (1, 1), let's determine the next move to continue towards the goal at (1, 3):

1. From (1, 1), the possible moves are:
   - Right to (1, 2)
   - Down to (2, 1)

To move closer to the goal at (1, 3), the best option is to move right to (1, 2).

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (1, 2), let's determine the next move to reach the goal at (1, 3):

1. From (1, 2), the possible moves are:
   - Right to (1, 3) (which is the goal)
   - Left to (1, 1)

Since moving right to (1, 3) will take us directly to the goal, that is the best move.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "U" shape. The path starts at the bottom of the "U" and moves up one side, across the top, and down the other side.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a "U" shape:

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
- **Empty:** (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
- **Player position:** (3, 1)
- **Goal:** (1, 3)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a "U" shape, but the configuration of walls and empty spaces is different from the original maze. The player can navigate from the starting position at (3, 1) to the goal at (1, 3) by moving through the empty spaces.
