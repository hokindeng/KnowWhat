You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (3, 1) to the goal position (1, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (3, 1)
2. **Goal Position**: (1, 3)

From (3, 1), the possible moves are:
- Up to (2, 1) [empty]
- Down to (4, 1) [empty]
- Left to (3, 0) [wall]
- Right to (3, 2) [wall]

The only valid move from (3, 1) is up to (2, 1).

**Next Move**: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves to continue towards the goal (1, 3):

1. **Current Position**: (2, 1)
2. **Goal Position**: (1, 3)

From (2, 1), the possible moves are:
- Up to (1, 1) [empty]
- Down to (3, 1) [empty]
- Left to (2, 0) [wall]
- Right to (2, 2) [wall]

The valid move that brings us closer to the goal is up to (1, 1).

**Next Move**: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves to continue towards the goal (1, 3):

1. **Current Position**: (1, 1)
2. **Goal Position**: (1, 3)

From (1, 1), the possible moves are:
- Up to (0, 1) [wall]
- Down to (2, 1) [empty]
- Left to (1, 0) [wall]
- Right to (1, 2) [empty]

The valid move that brings us closer to the goal is right to (1, 2).

**Next Move**: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal (1, 3):

1. **Current Position**: (1, 2)
2. **Goal Position**: (1, 3)

From (1, 2), the possible moves are:
- Up to (0, 2) [wall]
- Down to (2, 2) [wall]
- Left to (1, 1) [empty]
- Right to (1, 3) [goal]

The valid move that reaches the goal is right to (1, 3).

**Next Move**: (1, 3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape**: The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape resembling the letter "T". The vertical part of the "T" is formed by the empty spaces at (1, 1), (2, 1), and (3, 1), while the horizontal part is formed by the empty spaces at (1, 2) and (1, 3).

2. **New Maze**: Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a "T" shape. The maze includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G).

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
- **Empty**: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)
- **Player Position**: (3, 1)
- **Goal**: (1, 3)

This new maze maintains the "T" shape of the empty spaces and provides a valid path from the player position to the goal.
