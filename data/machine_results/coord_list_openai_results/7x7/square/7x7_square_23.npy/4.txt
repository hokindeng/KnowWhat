You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position to the goal position by moving through the empty spaces. The player's current position is (1, 5), and the goal is at (4, 4).

Let's examine the possible moves from the current position (1, 5):

1. **Up** to (0, 5) - This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
2. **Down** to (2, 5) - This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
3. **Left** to (1, 4) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
4. **Right** to (1, 6) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.

To progress towards the goal, let's move to the left to (1, 4).

The next move is to (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up** to (0, 4) - This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
2. **Down** to (2, 4) - This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
3. **Left** to (1, 3) - This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.
4. **Right** to (1, 5) - This is an empty space, but we just came from there, so it doesn't progress us towards the goal.

To continue towards the goal, let's move left to (1, 3).

The next move is to (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

3. **Left** to (1, 2) - This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves in a zigzag manner from the top to the bottom of the maze.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" shape:

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:** (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)

- **Player position:** (1, 3)

- **Goal:** (4, 5)

This new maze maintains the zigzag pattern of empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal.
