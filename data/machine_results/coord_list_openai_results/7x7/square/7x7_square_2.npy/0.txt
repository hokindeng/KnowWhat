You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position at (4, 6) to the goal position at (4, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (4, 6)
2. **Goal Position**: (4, 3)

From (4, 6), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 6) (empty space)
- Left to (4, 5) (wall, not possible)
- Down to (5, 6) (empty space)

To move towards the goal, let's choose the path that brings us closer to (4, 3). Moving up to (3, 6) seems like a good option because it keeps us on the path and potentially closer to the goal.

**Next Move**: (3, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (4, 6), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 6), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (3, 6)
2. **Goal Position**: (4, 3)

From (3, 6), the possible moves are:
- Down to (4, 6) (empty space)
- Left to (3, 5) (wall, not possible)
- Up to (2, 6) (empty space)

To make progress towards the goal, let's move down to (4, 6), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

**Next Move**: (4, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the oversight. Let's reevaluate the situation and find a path towards the goal at (4, 3).

1. **Current Position**: (4, 6)
2. **Goal Position**: (4, 3)

From (4, 6), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 6) (empty space)
- Left to (4, 5) (wall, not possible)
- Down to (5, 6) (empty space)

To make progress towards the goal, let's move down to (5, 6), which is an empty space and might help us find a path towards the goal.

**Next Move**: (5, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 3), we are very close to the goal at (4, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (5, 3)
2. **Goal Position**: (4, 3)

From (5, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up to (4, 3) (goal position)
- Right to (5, 4) (empty space)

Since moving up to (4, 3) will take us directly to the goal, let's make that move.

**Next Move**: (4, 3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "U" or a "hook" pattern. The path starts at the top, goes down, and then curves around to the left and back up.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar "U" or "hook" pattern for the empty spaces. We'll ensure that there is a valid path from the player position to the goal.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
- **Empty**: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (4, 3)
- **Player Position**: (5, 3)
- **Goal**: (2, 6)

This new configuration maintains the "U" or "hook" shape of the empty spaces, with a valid path from the player position to the goal. The path starts at (5, 3), moves up to (4, 3), then right to (4, 6), and finally up to the goal at (2, 6).
