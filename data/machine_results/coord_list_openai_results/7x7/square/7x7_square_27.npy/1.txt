You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (4, 6) to the goal at (1, 0) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's find the path step-by-step.

The player's current position is (4, 6). From here, the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 6)
- Down to (5, 6)

Since we need to move towards the goal at (1, 0), let's move up to (3, 6).

**Next move:** (3, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape:** The empty spaces in the original maze form a "U" shape. The path starts at the bottom right, goes up along the right side, then moves left across the top, and finally goes down the left side to reach the goal.

2. **New Maze:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a "U" shape path. The new maze will have a different configuration of walls and empty spaces but will maintain the "U" shape.

- **Walls:** (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
- **Empty:** (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6)
- **Player position:** (5, 0)
- **Goal:** (0, 6)

This new maze maintains the "U" shape, starting from the bottom left, moving up the left side, then across the bottom, and finally up the right side to reach the goal.
