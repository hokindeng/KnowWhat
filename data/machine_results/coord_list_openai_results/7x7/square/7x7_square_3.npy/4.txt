You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Empty: (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (4, 6) to the goal at (6, 5) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. From (4, 6), the possible moves are:
   - Left to (4, 5)
   - Down to (5, 6)

Since the goal is at (6, 5), moving down to (5, 6) seems like a more direct path. Let's make that move.

Next move: (5, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Empty: (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 6), the possible moves are:

1. Up to (4, 6)
2. Left to (5, 4)
3. Down to (6, 6)

Since the goal is at (6, 5), moving down to (6, 6) will bring us closer to the goal. Let's make that move.

Next move: (6, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Empty: (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 4)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6, 6), the possible moves are:

1. Up to (5, 6)
2. Left to (6, 5)

Since the goal is at (6, 5), moving left to (6, 5) will reach the goal. Let's make that move.

Next move: (6, 5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape: "L-shape"**

The empty spaces in the original maze form an "L-shape" pattern, with a vertical segment and a horizontal segment.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with an "L-shape" path. The new maze will have a different configuration but maintain the "L-shape" pattern.

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
- **Empty:** (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5)
- **Player position:** (4, 6)
- **Goal:** (6, 5)

In this new configuration, the empty spaces still form an "L-shape" pattern, with the player starting at (4, 6) and the goal at (6, 5). The path is different from the original but maintains the same general shape.
