You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position at (3, 6) to the goal at (0, 1), moving only through empty spaces and avoiding walls. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. From (3, 6), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (2, 6)
   - Left to (3, 5)

Since (3, 5) is a wall, the only valid move is to go up to (2, 6).

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 6), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (1, 6)
2. Down to (3, 6)
3. Left to (2, 5)

Since (2, 5) is a wall and (3, 6) is where we came from, the valid move is to go up to (1, 6).

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)

3. Left to (1, 5)

Since (1, 5) is a wall and (2, 6) is where we came from, the valid move is to go up to (0, 6).

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

2. Left to (0, 1)

The goal is at (0, 1), so the valid move is to go left to (0, 1).

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "spiral" or "snail shell" pattern. The path starts at the outer edge and spirals inward, allowing movement from the player position to the goal.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape
Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar spiral pattern but with a different configuration of walls and empty spaces. The player position (P) and goal (G) will also be different, but the path will still form a spiral shape.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1)
- **Empty**: (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1)
- **Player position**: (0, 6)
- **Goal**: (3, 1)

This new maze maintains the spiral shape of the empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal.
