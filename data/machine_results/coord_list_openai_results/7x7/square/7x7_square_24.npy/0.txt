You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (1, 4) to the goal at (0, 6) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 4)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - **Up**: (0, 4) - This is an empty space.
   - **Down**: (2, 4) - This is an empty space.
   - **Left**: (1, 3) - This is a wall.
   - **Right**: (1, 5) - This is a wall.

Given these options, moving **up** to (0, 4) is a valid move. Let's proceed with that.

**Next Move**: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (0, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position at (0, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves to continue towards the goal at (0, 6):

1. **Current Position**: (0, 4)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - **Up**: Not possible, as it would go out of bounds.
   - **Down**: (1, 4) - This is an empty space.
   - **Left**: (0, 3) - This is a wall.
   - **Right**: (0, 5) - This is an empty space.

Moving **right** to (0, 5) is a valid move and brings us closer to the goal.

**Next Move**: (0, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (0, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position at (0, 5), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal at (0, 6):

1. **Current Position**: (0, 5)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - **Up**: Not possible, as it would go out of bounds.
   - **Down**: (1, 5) - This is a wall.
   - **Left**: (0, 4) - This is an empty space.
   - **Right**: (0, 6) - This is the goal position.

Moving **right** to (0, 6) will reach the goal.

**Next Move**: (0, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

The empty spaces in the original maze are arranged in a shape that resembles an "L". The path starts at (1, 4), moves up to (0, 4), then right to (0, 5), and finally right to the goal at (0, 6).

### (2) New Maze with the Same "L" Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size, with the empty spaces forming an "L" shape. The maze will have a valid path from a new player position to a new goal position.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
- **Empty**: (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 6)
- **Player Position**: (2, 4)
- **Goal**: (2, 6)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an "L" shape, starting from (2, 4), moving up to (0, 4), and then right to (2, 6). The player can move from (2, 4) to (2, 6) to reach the goal.
