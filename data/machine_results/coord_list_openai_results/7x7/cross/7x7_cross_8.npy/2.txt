You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the maze configuration, the player is currently at position (2, 4) and the goal is at position (2, 2). The player can move to any adjacent empty space, including diagonals. Let's evaluate the possible moves:

- From (2, 4), the possible moves are:
  - Up to (1, 4), but (1, 4) is a wall.
  - Down to (3, 4), but (3, 4) is a wall.
  - Left to (2, 3), which is an empty space.
  - Right to (2, 5), but (2, 5) is a wall.
  - Diagonally up-left to (1, 3), which is an empty space.
  - Diagonally up-right to (1, 5), but (1, 5) is a wall.
  - Diagonally down-left to (3, 3), but (3, 3) is a wall.
  - Diagonally down-right to (3, 5), but (3, 5) is a wall.

The viable moves are to (2, 3) and (1, 3). Moving to (2, 3) brings us closer to the goal (2, 2).

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To solve this task, let's first analyze the original maze's empty spaces:

### Original Maze Analysis
The original maze's empty spaces are at the following coordinates:
- (0, 2)
- (0, 4)
- (1, 3)

These empty spaces form a straight line, which can be described as a "vertical line" shape when considering the path from top to bottom.

### New Maze Design
To create a new maze with the same "vertical line" shape, we need to ensure the empty spaces form a similar pattern. The new maze should have the same dimensions and a valid path from the player position to the goal.

#### New Maze Configuration
- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
- **Empty:** (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2)
- **Player position:** (2, 4)
- **Goal:** (2, 2)

### Explanation
In this new maze, the empty spaces (0, 2), (1, 2), and (2, 2) form a vertical line, similar to the original maze's shape. The player can move from (2, 4) to (2, 2) by first moving left to (2, 3) and then up to (2, 2), reaching the goal. This maintains the "vertical line" shape while providing a valid path from the player to the goal.
