You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the maze configuration, the player is currently at position (2, 4) and the goal is at position (2, 2). The player can move to any adjacent empty space. Let's analyze the possible moves:

- From (2, 4), the player can move to:
  - (1, 3) which is an empty space.
  - (0, 4) which is an empty space.

The goal is at (2, 2), and the player needs to move towards it. Moving to (1, 3) is a step closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move should be to (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is currently at position (1, 3) and the goal is at position (2, 2). Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position:

- From (1, 3), the player can move to:
  - (0, 2) which is an empty space.
  - (0, 4) which is an empty space.
  - (2, 4) which is an empty space.

To move closer to the goal at (2, 2), the player should move to (0, 2), which is a step closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move should be to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is currently at position (0, 2) and the goal is at position (2, 2). Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position:

- From (0, 2), the player can move to:
  - (1, 3) which is an empty space.

The goal is directly below the current position at (2, 2), but there is a wall at (1, 2) blocking the direct path. The player should move to (1, 3) to get closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move should be to (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is currently at position (1, 3) and the goal is at position (2, 2). Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position:

- From (1, 3), the player can move to:
  - (0, 2) which is an empty space.
  - (2, 4) which is an empty space.

To move closer to the goal at (2, 2), the player should move to (2, 4), which is a step closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move should be to (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is currently at position (2, 4) and the goal is at position (2, 2). Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position:

- From (2, 4), the player can move to:
  - (1, 3) which is an empty space.

To move closer to the goal at (2, 2), the player should move to (1, 3), which is a step closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move should be to (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the oversight in my previous responses. Let's reassess the situation to find a path to the goal.

The player is currently at position (1, 3) and the goal is at position (2, 2). From (1, 3), the player can move to:

- (0, 2) which is an empty space.
- (2, 4) which is an empty space.

To reach the goal at (2, 2), the player should consider moving to (0, 2) and then attempt to find a path from there. However, given the current configuration, it seems there is no direct path to the goal due to the walls surrounding the goal.

Let's try moving to (0, 2) and reassess the situation from there. Therefore, the next move should be to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's carefully analyze the situation again.

The player is currently at position (0, 2) and the goal is at position (2, 2). The available empty spaces are (0, 4), (1, 3), and (2, 4). However, the goal at (2, 2) is surrounded by walls, making it inaccessible from any of the current empty spaces.

Given the current configuration of walls and empty spaces, it seems there is no valid path to reach the goal at (2, 2) from the available empty spaces. The goal is completely enclosed by walls, which means it is not possible to reach it with the given maze layout.

If there are any changes to the maze configuration or additional empty spaces, please let me know, and I will reassess the situation.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

In the original maze, the empty spaces are at coordinates: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), and (2, 4). These coordinates form a zigzag pattern, which can be described as a "Z" shape.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a valid path from the player position to the goal, maintaining the "Z" shape pattern of the empty spaces. The new maze will have different wall and empty space configurations but will preserve the recognizable "Z" shape.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:** (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2)

- **Player position:** (0, 2)

- **Goal:** (2, 2)

In this new configuration, the empty spaces still form a "Z" shape, and there is a valid path from the player position at (0, 2) to the goal at (2, 2) through the empty spaces.
