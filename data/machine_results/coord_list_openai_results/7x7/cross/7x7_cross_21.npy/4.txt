You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the maze configuration, the player is currently at position (3, 0) and the goal is at position (3, 2). The player can only move through empty spaces, which are (1, 0), (1, 2), and (2, 1). 

From the current position (3, 0), the player can move to the adjacent empty space (2, 1). This move is valid because (2, 1) is an empty space and is adjacent to (3, 0).

Therefore, the next move is to position (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 2), (3, 0)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 1), the player needs to move towards the goal at (3, 2). The available empty spaces are (1, 0), (1, 2), and (3, 0).

The player can move to (1, 2) from (2, 1) as it is an empty space and is adjacent to the current position. This move will bring the player closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to position (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 2), the player needs to move towards the goal at (3, 2). The available empty spaces are (1, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 0).

The player can move to (2, 1) from (1, 2) as it is an empty space and is adjacent to the current position. This move will bring the player closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to position (2, 1).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the oversight. Let's reassess the situation.

The player is currently at position (2, 1), and the goal is at (3, 2). The available empty spaces are (1, 0), (1, 2), and (3, 0).

From (2, 1), the player can move to (3, 0), which is an empty space and is adjacent to the current position. This move will bring the player closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to position (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's try to find a path to the goal from the current position.

The player is currently at position (3, 0), and the goal is at (3, 2). The available empty spaces are (1, 0), (1, 2), and (2, 1).

From (3, 0), the player can move to (2, 1), which is an empty space and is adjacent to the current position. This move will allow us to explore further options to reach the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to position (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 2), (3, 0)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the previous errors. Let's carefully analyze the situation again.

The player is currently at position (2, 1), and the goal is at (3, 2). The available empty spaces are (1, 0), (1, 2), and (3, 0).

From (2, 1), the player can move to (1, 2), which is an empty space and is adjacent to the current position. This move will allow us to explore further options to reach the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to position (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's reassess the situation.

The player is currently at position (1, 2), and the goal is at (3, 2). The available empty spaces are (1, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 0).

From (1, 2), the player can move back to (2, 1), which is an empty space and is adjacent to the current position. This move will allow us to explore further options to reach the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to position (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 2), (3, 0)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the oversight. Let's carefully analyze the situation again.

The player is currently at position (2, 1), and the goal is at (3, 2). The available empty spaces are (1, 0), (1, 2), and (3, 0).

Given the current configuration, it seems there is no direct path from the current position to the goal using the available empty spaces. The goal at (3, 2) is surrounded by walls, making it inaccessible from the current empty spaces.

Therefore, based on the provided maze configuration, it appears that reaching the goal is not possible with the current set of empty spaces. If there are any additional details or corrections to the maze configuration, please let me know.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

In the original maze, the empty spaces are at coordinates: (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1), and (3, 0). These empty spaces form a shape that resembles a "Z" or zigzag pattern.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar "Z" shape for the empty spaces. This new maze will have a valid path from the player position to the goal.

**New Maze Configuration:**

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:** (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3)

- **Player position:** (1, 0)

- **Goal:** (4, 3)

In this new configuration, the empty spaces form a "Z" shape, and there is a valid path from the player position (1, 0) to the goal (4, 3) through the empty spaces.
