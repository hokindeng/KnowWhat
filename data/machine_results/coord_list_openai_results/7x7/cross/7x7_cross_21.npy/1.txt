You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the maze configuration, the player is currently at position (3, 0) and the goal is at position (3, 2). The player can only move through empty spaces, which are at coordinates (1, 0), (1, 2), and (2, 1). 

From the current position (3, 0), the player cannot move directly to any empty space because all adjacent positions are either walls or out of bounds. Therefore, it seems there is no valid path from the player position to the goal using the given empty spaces.

If there is no path available, the player cannot reach the goal. Please verify the maze configuration or provide additional empty spaces if there is an error.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze. The empty spaces are at coordinates (1, 0), (1, 2), and (2, 1). These points form a shape that resembles an "L" or a "zigzag" pattern.

### (1) General Shape: "Zigzag"

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7) with a valid path from the player position to the goal, maintaining a "zigzag" pattern for the empty spaces.

#### New Maze Configuration:

- **Walls:** 
  - (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)
  - (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)
  - (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)
  - (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
  - (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
  - (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
  - (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty Spaces (Path):**
  - (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2)

- **Player Position:** (2, 0)

- **Goal Position:** (3, 2)

In this new configuration, the player can move from (2, 0) to (1, 0), then to (1, 2), then to (2, 1), and finally to (3, 2) to reach the goal, following a zigzag path.
