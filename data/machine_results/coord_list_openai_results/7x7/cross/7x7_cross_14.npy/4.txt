You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (5, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces and avoiding walls. The player's current position is (3, 4), and the goal is at (5, 2).

Let's examine the possible moves from the current position (3, 4):

1. **Up** to (2, 4) - This is a wall.
2. **Down** to (4, 4) - This is a wall.
3. **Left** to (3, 3) - This is a wall.
4. **Right** to (3, 5) - This is a wall.
5. **Up-Left** to (2, 3) - This is a wall.
6. **Up-Right** to (2, 5) - This is an empty space.
7. **Down-Left** to (4, 3) - This is an empty space.
8. **Down-Right** to (4, 5) - This is a wall.

From the above options, the only valid moves are to (2, 5) and (4, 3), both of which are empty spaces.

To move closer to the goal (5, 2), let's choose the move to (4, 3), as it seems to be a more direct path towards the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 4), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (5, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal at (5, 2):

1. **Up** to (3, 3) - This is a wall.
2. **Down** to (5, 3) - This is a wall.
3. **Left** to (4, 2) - This is a wall.
4. **Right** to (4, 4) - This is a wall.
5. **Up-Left** to (3, 2) - This is an empty space.
6. **Up-Right** to (3, 4) - This is an empty space.
7. **Down-Left** to (5, 2) - This is the goal position.
8. **Down-Right** to (5, 4) - This is an empty space.

The move to (5, 2) is directly to the goal position. Therefore, the next move is to (5, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first analyze the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

The empty spaces in the original maze are: (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 5). 

If we visualize these coordinates on a grid, they form a zigzag pattern that can be described as a "Z" shape. The path starts at the top, moves diagonally downwards, and then shifts direction to continue in a zigzag manner.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a "Z" shaped path. We'll ensure that the path is not identical to the original but maintains the recognizable "Z" shape.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
- **Empty**: (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 5)
- **Player position**: (2, 2)
- **Goal**: (6, 5)

This new configuration maintains a "Z" shape for the empty spaces, starting from (2, 2) and ending at (6, 5), while ensuring the path is not identical to the original maze.
