You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (1, 1) to the goal at (5, 1) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position:

Current position: (1, 1)

Possible moves from (1, 1) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (0, 0) is an empty space and can be reached by moving up-left.
- (0, 6) is not adjacent.
- (1, 5) is an empty space and can be reached by moving right-right-right-right.
- (2, 2) is an empty space and can be reached by moving down-right.
- (2, 4) is not adjacent.
- (3, 3) is not adjacent.
- (4, 2) is not adjacent.
- (4, 4) is not adjacent.
- (5, 5) is not adjacent.
- (6, 0) is not adjacent.
- (6, 6) is not adjacent.

From (1, 1), the only adjacent empty space is (2, 2). Let's move to (2, 2).

Next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (5, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

Current position: (2, 2)

Possible moves from (2, 2) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (1, 1) is an empty space and can be reached by moving up-left.
- (1, 5) is not adjacent.
- (2, 4) is an empty space and can be reached by moving right-right.
- (3, 3) is an empty space and can be reached by moving down-right.
- (4, 2) is not adjacent.
- (4, 4) is not adjacent.
- (5, 5) is not adjacent.
- (6, 0) is not adjacent.
- (6, 6) is not adjacent.

From (2, 2), the adjacent empty spaces are (2, 4) and (3, 3). Moving to (3, 3) seems to bring us closer to the goal at (5, 1).

Next move: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (5, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

Current position: (3, 3)

Possible moves from (3, 3) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (2, 2) is an empty space and can be reached by moving up-left.
- (2, 4) is an empty space and can be reached by moving up-right.
- (4, 2) is an empty space and can be reached by moving down-left.
- (4, 4) is an empty space and can be reached by moving down-right.

From (3, 3), moving to (4, 2) seems to bring us closer to the goal at (5, 1).

Next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (5, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

Current position: (4, 2)

Possible moves from (4, 2) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (3, 3) is an empty space and can be reached by moving up-right.
- (4, 4) is an empty space and can be reached by moving right-right.

The goal position (5, 1) is directly below (4, 2), but it is not listed as an empty space, so we need to find a path around the walls. Moving to (3, 3) or (4, 4) does not seem to bring us closer to the goal directly, but let's try moving to (4, 4) to explore further options.

Next move: (4, 4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

Upon examining the coordinates of the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern is characterized by a series of connected diagonal and orthogonal moves that create a path through the maze.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar "zigzag" pattern of empty spaces. The new maze will have a valid path from the player position to the goal position, but it will not be identical to the original maze.

**New Maze:**

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)

- **Empty:** (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 6)

- **Player position:** (1, 1)

- **Goal:** (5, 1)

This new maze maintains the "zigzag" pattern of empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal while differing from the original maze configuration.
