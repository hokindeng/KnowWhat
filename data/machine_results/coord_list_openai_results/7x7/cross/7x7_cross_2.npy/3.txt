You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position at (3, 2) to the goal position at (5, 0), moving only through empty spaces and avoiding walls. The empty spaces available for movement are (3, 0), (4, 1), and (5, 2).

From the current position (3, 2), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- Move to (4, 1)

Let's make the move to (4, 1).

New player position: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (4, 1), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (5, 0). The available empty spaces adjacent to (4, 1) are:

- Move to (3, 0)
- Move to (5, 2)

To get closer to the goal, let's move to (3, 0).

New player position: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (3, 0), the available empty spaces adjacent to this position are:

- Move to (4, 1)

Since we need to move towards the goal at (5, 0), let's move back to (4, 1) to continue our path.

New player position: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (4, 1), the available empty spaces adjacent to this position are:

- Move to (3, 0)
- Move to (5, 2)

To make progress towards the goal at (5, 0), let's move to (5, 2).

New player position: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 1)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (5, 2), the available empty spaces adjacent to this position are:

- Move to (4, 1)

However, to reach the goal at (5, 0), we need to find a path that gets us closer. Since there are no direct empty spaces leading to (5, 0) from (5, 2), let's backtrack to (4, 1) and reassess our path.

New player position: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's reassess the situation to find a path to the goal at (5, 0).

From the current position (4, 1), the available empty spaces are:

- Move to (3, 0)
- Move to (3, 2)

To make progress towards the goal, let's move to (3, 2), which might open up new paths.

New player position: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Given the current position at (3, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Move to (4, 1)

Since we've tried other paths and need to find a way to the goal at (5, 0), let's move back to (4, 1) and consider our options again.

New player position: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the oversight. Let's try a different approach to reach the goal at (5, 0).

From the current position (4, 1), the available empty spaces are:

- Move to (3, 0)
- Move to (3, 2)

Since moving to (3, 0) and (3, 2) hasn't been effective in reaching the goal, let's reconsider the path from (5, 2). 

From (4, 1), move to (5, 2) again.

New player position: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 1)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's try to find a path to the goal at (5, 0) from the current position (5, 2).

From (5, 2), the only adjacent empty space is (4, 1), which doesn't directly help us reach the goal. It seems there might be no direct path to the goal given the current configuration of walls and empty spaces.

Given the constraints, it appears that reaching the goal at (5, 0) is not possible with the current set of empty spaces. If there are any additional empty spaces or if the goal position can be adjusted, please let me know. Otherwise, the maze might not have a valid solution with the current setup.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task:

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):**
   The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "Z" or zigzag pattern. The path starts at (3, 0), moves to (4, 1), and then to (5, 2).

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**
   Let's create a new maze of the same size, with a valid path from the player position to the goal, maintaining the "Z" shape pattern. The original maze seems to be a 7x7 grid.

   **New Maze:**

   - **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

   - **Empty:** (3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0)

   - **Player position:** (3, 0)

   - **Goal:** (5, 0)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a "Z" shape, but the path is now directly from (3, 0) to (4, 1) and then to the goal at (5, 0). This configuration maintains the recognizable "Z" pattern while providing a valid path from the player position to the goal.
