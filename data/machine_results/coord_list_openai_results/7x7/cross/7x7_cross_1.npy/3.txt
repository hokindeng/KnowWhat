You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position at (6, 1) to the goal position at (6, 3) by moving through empty spaces. The available empty spaces are (4, 1), (4, 3), and (5, 2).

From the current position (6, 1), the possible moves are:
- Up to (5, 1), but it's a wall.
- Down is out of bounds.
- Left to (6, 0), but it's a wall.
- Right to (6, 2), but it's a wall.
- Diagonally up-left to (5, 0), but it's a wall.
- Diagonally up-right to (5, 2), which is an empty space.
- Diagonally down-left is out of bounds.
- Diagonally down-right is out of bounds.

The only valid move is diagonally up-right to (5, 2).

So, the next move is to (5, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (6, 1)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (5, 2), we need to find a path to the goal at (6, 3) by moving through empty spaces.

From (5, 2), the possible moves are:
- Up to (4, 2), but it's a wall.
- Down to (6, 2), but it's a wall.
- Left to (5, 1), but it's a wall.
- Right to (5, 3), which is an empty space.
- Diagonally up-left to (4, 1), which is an empty space.
- Diagonally up-right to (4, 3), which is an empty space.
- Diagonally down-left to (6, 1), which is an empty space.
- Diagonally down-right to (6, 3), which is the goal.

The optimal move is diagonally down-right to (6, 3), which is the goal position.

So, the next move is to (6, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task:

1. **Name of the General Shape**: The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "Z" or zigzag pattern. The path starts at the bottom left, moves diagonally up-right, and then continues to the right.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape**:

   Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces. The new maze will have a valid path from the player position to the goal position, but it will not be an identical copy of the original maze.

   **New Maze Configuration**:

   - **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

   - **Empty**: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 3)

   - **Player Position**: (6, 1)

   - **Goal**: (6, 3)

   In this new configuration, the empty spaces still form a "Z" shape, and there is a valid path from the player position at (6, 1) to the goal at (6, 3).
