You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (4, 4) to the goal position (2, 6) by moving through the empty spaces. The available empty spaces are (2, 4), (3, 5), and (4, 6).

From the current position (4, 4), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- Move to (4, 6) (right and up)
- Move to (3, 5) (up and left)

To make progress towards the goal (2, 6), let's move to (3, 5).

The next move is to (3, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 5), we need to continue moving towards the goal position (2, 6). The available empty spaces are now (2, 4), (4, 4), and (4, 6).

From (3, 5), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- Move to (2, 4) (up and left)

Moving to (2, 4) will bring us closer to the goal (2, 6).

The next move is to (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 4), we need to move towards the goal position (2, 6). However, there are no direct empty spaces adjacent to (2, 4) that lead directly to the goal. We need to backtrack slightly to find a path.

The available empty spaces are (3, 5), (4, 4), and (4, 6). From (2, 4), the possible move to an adjacent empty space is:
- Move to (3, 5) (down and right)

Let's move back to (3, 5) to explore other paths.

The next move is to (3, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 5), we need to find a path to the goal position (2, 6). The available empty spaces are (2, 4), (4, 4), and (4, 6).

From (3, 5), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- Move to (2, 4) (up and left)
- Move to (4, 6) (down and right)

Since moving to (2, 4) did not lead us closer to the goal, let's try moving to (4, 6) to explore a different path.

The next move is to (4, 6).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 6), we need to move towards the goal position (2, 6). The available empty spaces are (2, 4), (3, 5), and (4, 4).

From (4, 6), the possible move to an adjacent empty space is:
- Move to (3, 5) (up and left)

Empty: (2, 4), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's reassess the situation to find a path to the goal (2, 6).

From the current position (3, 5), the available empty spaces are (2, 4), (4, 4), and (4, 6). However, none of these directly lead to the goal. Let's try a different approach:

1. Move to (2, 4) (up and left) to explore the possibility of moving closer to the goal.

The next move is to (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the oversight. Let's try a different approach to reach the goal at (2, 6).

From the current position (2, 4), the available empty spaces are (3, 5), (4, 4), and (4, 6). However, none of these directly lead to the goal. It seems we need to find a new path.

Given the constraints, it appears there might be an error in the maze setup or the available paths, as the current configuration does not allow a direct path to the goal. If there are no additional empty spaces or paths, reaching the goal might not be possible with the current setup.

If there are any additional details or corrections to the maze, please let me know. Otherwise, based on the current information, it seems there is no valid path to the goal.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

In the original maze, the empty spaces are at coordinates (2, 4), (3, 5), and (4, 6). These points form a diagonal line from the bottom left to the top right. Therefore, the general shape of the empty spaces can be described as a "diagonal line."

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size, with a valid path from the player position to the goal, maintaining the diagonal line shape for the empty spaces. The original maze seems to be a 7x7 grid based on the coordinates provided.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:** (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)

- **Player position:** (4, 2)

- **Goal:** (2, 4)

In this new configuration, the empty spaces (2, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4) form a diagonal line, similar to the original shape. The player can move from (4, 2) to (4, 4), then to (3, 3), and finally to (2, 4) to reach the goal.
