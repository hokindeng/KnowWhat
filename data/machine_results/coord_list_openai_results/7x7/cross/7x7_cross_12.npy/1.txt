You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (5, 6) to the goal position (4, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. From (5, 6), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (4, 5) (up-left)
   - (5, 5) (left) - but this is a wall
   - (4, 6) (up) - but this is a wall

The only valid move from (5, 6) is to (4, 5).

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 5), we need to move towards the goal position (4, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (4, 5), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (3, 4) (up-left)
   - (5, 6) (down-right) - but this is moving away from the goal
   - (5, 2) (down-left) - but this is moving away from the goal

The best move towards the goal is to (3, 4).

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

   - (2, 3) (up-left)
   - (4, 5) (down-right) - but this is moving away from the goal

The best move towards the goal is to (2, 3).

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 3).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 3), we need to move towards the goal position (4, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (2, 3), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (2, 5) (right) - but this is moving away from the goal
   - (3, 4) (down-right)

The best move towards the goal is to (3, 4).

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 4), we need to move towards the goal position (4, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (3, 4), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (2, 3) (up-left) - but this is moving back
   - (4, 5) (down-right)

The best move towards the goal is to (4, 5).

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 5), we need to move towards the goal position (4, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (4, 5), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (3, 4) (up-left) - but this is moving back
   - (5, 6) (down-right) - but this is moving away from the goal

Unfortunately, it seems I made an error in the previous steps. Let's correct the path:

To reach the goal (4, 3) from (4, 5), we should have moved to (3, 4) and then to (4, 3). However, since we are at (4, 5) now, we need to backtrack to (3, 4) and then move to (4, 3).

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 4), we need to move towards the goal position (4, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (3, 4), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (2, 3) (up-left) - but this is moving away from the goal
   - (4, 5) (down-right) - but this is moving away from the goal

The best move towards the goal is to move directly to (4, 3), which is diagonally down-left from (3, 4).

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

The empty spaces in the original maze are: 
- (1, 2), (1, 6)
- (2, 3), (2, 5)
- (3, 4)
- (4, 5)
- (5, 2), (5, 6)

These coordinates form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern, moving diagonally and vertically across the grid.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern for the empty spaces. We'll ensure there's a valid path from a new player position to a new goal position.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:** (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 5)

- **Player position:** (5, 5)

- **Goal:** (1, 2)

This new configuration maintains the "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern of empty spaces, ensuring a valid path from the player position to the goal.
