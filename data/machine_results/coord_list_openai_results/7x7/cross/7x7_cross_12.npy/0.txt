You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (5, 6) to the goal at (4, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. From (5, 6), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (4, 5) (up)
   - (5, 5) (left)
   - (4, 6) (up-left diagonal)

However, (5, 5) is a wall, so we cannot move there. The only valid move is to (4, 5).

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (4, 5), we need to move towards the goal at (4, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (4, 5), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (3, 4) (up)
   - (5, 6) (down-right diagonal)

The goal is at (4, 3), which is directly to the left of (4, 5), but (4, 4) is a wall, so we cannot move directly left. However, moving to (3, 4) will bring us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (3, 4), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (3, 4), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (4, 5) (down)
   - (2, 5) (up-right diagonal)

The goal is at (4, 3), which is directly below and to the left of (3, 4). However, (4, 3) is not directly accessible from (3, 4) due to walls. We need to find a path that brings us closer to the goal.

The best move to make progress towards the goal is to move back to (4, 5), which will allow us to approach the goal from a different angle.

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (4, 5), we need to find a path to the goal at (4, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (4, 5), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (3, 4) (up)
   - (5, 6) (down-right diagonal)

Since moving back to (3, 4) doesn't help us reach the goal, let's consider a different approach. We need to find a path that allows us to approach the goal from a different angle.

Let's move to (5, 6) to explore other potential paths.

Therefore, the next move is to (5, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the oversight. Let's reevaluate the situation to find a viable path to the goal at (4, 3).

From the current player position at (5, 6), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- (4, 5) (up)
- (5, 2) (left, left, left)

Since moving to (4, 5) and back to (5, 6) hasn't been productive, let's try a different path by moving to (5, 2), which might open up new possibilities.

Therefore, the next move is to (5, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern is characterized by a series of connected diagonal and horizontal/vertical moves that create a zigzagging path through the maze.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape
Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar zigzag pattern of empty spaces. The new maze will have a valid path from a new player position to a new goal position.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls:** 
  - (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)
  - (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)
  - (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)
  - (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
  - (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
  - (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
  - (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:**
  - (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 3)

- **Player position:** (1, 2)
- **Goal:** (5, 3)

This new maze maintains the zigzag pattern of empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal. The path involves moving diagonally and vertically/horizontally, similar to the original maze's pattern.
