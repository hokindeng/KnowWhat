You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (1, 3) to the goal position (3, 1) by moving through the empty spaces. The available empty spaces are (1, 1), (2, 2), and (3, 3).

Let's evaluate the possible moves from the current position (1, 3):

1. **Move to (2, 2):** This is a valid move as (2, 2) is an empty space and is adjacent to (1, 3) diagonally.

2. **Move to (1, 1):** This is also a valid move as (1, 1) is an empty space and is adjacent to (1, 3) horizontally.

3. **Move to (3, 3):** This is a valid move as (3, 3) is an empty space and is adjacent to (1, 3) diagonally.

Considering the goal is at (3, 1), moving to (2, 2) seems like a strategic choice as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 2), we need to move towards the goal position (3, 1). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Move to (1, 1):** This is a valid move as (1, 1) is an empty space and is adjacent to (2, 2) diagonally.

2. **Move to (1, 3):** This is a valid move as (1, 3) is an empty space and is adjacent to (2, 2) diagonally.

3. **Move to (3, 3):** This is a valid move as (3, 3) is an empty space and is adjacent to (2, 2) diagonally.

The goal is at (3, 1), and moving to (3, 3) will bring us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 3), we need to move towards the goal position (3, 1). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Move to (2, 2):** This is a valid move as (2, 2) is an empty space and is adjacent to (3, 3) diagonally.

2. **Move to (1, 3):** This is a valid move as (1, 3) is an empty space and is adjacent to (3, 3) diagonally.

The goal is at (3, 1), and moving to (2, 2) will bring us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the oversight. Let's reevaluate the situation from the current player position (2, 2) to reach the goal at (3, 1).

From (2, 2), the possible moves are:

1. **Move to (1, 1):** This is a valid move as (1, 1) is an empty space and is adjacent to (2, 2) diagonally.

2. **Move to (1, 3):** This is a valid move as (1, 3) is an empty space and is adjacent to (2, 2) diagonally.

3. **Move to (3, 3):** This is a valid move as (3, 3) is an empty space and is adjacent to (2, 2) diagonally.

To get closer to the goal at (3, 1), moving to (1, 1) is a strategic choice as it positions us to move directly to the goal in the next step.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 1), we need to move towards the goal position (3, 1). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Move to (2, 2):** This is a valid move as (2, 2) is an empty space and is adjacent to (1, 1) diagonally.

2. **Move to (1, 3):** This is a valid move as (1, 3) is an empty space and is adjacent to (1, 1) horizontally.

The goal is at (3, 1), and we need to find a path that brings us closer to the goal. However, given the current empty spaces, we need to backtrack to explore other paths.

Let's move back to (2, 2) to explore further options.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's reassess the situation from the current player position (2, 2) to reach the goal at (3, 1).

From (2, 2), the possible moves are:

1. **Move to (1, 1):** This is a valid move as (1, 1) is an empty space and is adjacent to (2, 2) diagonally.

2. **Move to (1, 3):** This is a valid move as (1, 3) is an empty space and is adjacent to (2, 2) diagonally.

3. **Move to (3, 3):** This is a valid move as (3, 3) is an empty space and is adjacent to (2, 2) diagonally.

To reach the goal at (3, 1), moving to (3, 3) is a strategic choice as it positions us to move directly to the goal in the next step.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the oversight. Let's carefully evaluate the situation from the current player position (3, 3) to reach the goal at (3, 1).

From (3, 3), the possible moves are:

1. **Move to (2, 2):** This is a valid move as (2, 2) is an empty space and is adjacent to (3, 3) diagonally.

2. **Move to (1, 3):** This is a valid move as (1, 3) is an empty space and is adjacent to (3, 3) diagonally.

To reach the goal at (3, 1), we need to find a path that brings us closer to the goal. However, given the current empty spaces, we need to backtrack to explore other paths.

Let's move back to (2, 2) to explore further options.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 2).

Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the previous confusion. Let's carefully analyze the situation to find a path to the goal at (3, 1) from the current position (2, 2).

From (2, 2), the possible moves are:

1. **Move to (1, 1):** This is a valid move as (1, 1) is an empty space and is adjacent to (2, 2) diagonally.

2. **Move to (1, 3):** This is a valid move as (1, 3) is an empty space and is adjacent to (2, 2) diagonally.

3. **Move to (3, 3):** This is a valid move as (3, 3) is an empty space and is adjacent to (2, 2) diagonally.

To reach the goal at (3, 1), we need to find a path that brings us closer to the goal. Let's try moving to (1, 3) to explore further options.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the previous confusion. Let's try to find a path to the goal at (3, 1) from the current position (1, 3).

From (1, 3), the possible moves are:

1. **Move to (2, 2):** This is a valid move as (2, 2) is an empty space and is adjacent to (1, 3) diagonally.

2. **Move to (1, 1):** This is a valid move as (1, 1) is an empty space and is adjacent to (1, 3) horizontally.

The goal is at (3, 1), and we need to find a path that brings us closer to the goal. Let's try moving to (1, 1) to explore further options.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape:**
   The empty spaces in the original maze form a diagonal line or "zigzag" pattern. This pattern is characterized by a series of connected diagonal moves.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

   Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar zigzag pattern of empty spaces. We'll ensure that there is a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G).

   **New Maze:**

   - **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

   - **Empty:** (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)

   - **Player position:** (1, 3)

   - **Goal:** (4, 2)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a zigzag pattern, and there is a valid path from the player position (1, 3) to the goal (4, 2) through the empty spaces.
