You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Empty: (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 4)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (6, 6) to the goal position (4, 6) by moving through the empty spaces. The available empty spaces are (4, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 4).

From the current position (6, 6), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- Move to (5, 5)

Let's make the first move to (5, 5).

**Next move:** (5, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Empty: (4, 4), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 5), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- Move to (4, 4)
- Move to (6, 4)

To get closer to the goal (4, 6), let's move to (4, 4).

**Next move:** (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Empty: (5, 5), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 4), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- Move to (5, 5)

However, to reach the goal (4, 6), we need to find a path that allows us to move closer to the goal. Let's backtrack to (5, 5) and then move to (6, 4) to explore a different path.

**Next move:** (5, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)

Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6, 4), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- Move to (5, 5)

To continue towards the goal (4, 6), let's move back to (5, 5) and then we can try to find a path from there.

**Next move:** (5, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Empty: (4, 4), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's reassess the situation to find a path to the goal (4, 6).

From the current position (5, 5), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- Move to (4, 4)
- Move to (6, 4)

Since moving to (4, 4) and (6, 4) hasn't been successful in reaching the goal, let's try a different approach. We need to find a way to reach the goal (4, 6) from the available empty spaces.

Let's move to (6, 6) and see if we can find a path from there.

**Next move:** (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the oversight in previous steps. Let's try to find a path to the goal (4, 6) from the current position (6, 4).

From (6, 4), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- Move to (5, 5)

Since we have been moving in circles, let's try a different approach. We need to find a way to reach the goal (4, 6) from the available empty spaces.

Let's move to (5, 5) and then try to find a path from there.

**Next move:** (5, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Empty: (4, 4), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the previous confusion. Let's carefully analyze the situation to find a path to the goal (4, 6).

From the current position (5, 5), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- Move to (4, 4)
- Move to (6, 4)

Given the constraints and the available empty spaces, it seems there is no direct path to the goal (4, 6) from the current set of empty spaces. The goal is surrounded by walls, making it unreachable from the current empty spaces.

If there are no additional empty spaces or paths available, it appears that the goal is not reachable with the current configuration of the maze. If there are any additional details or corrections to the maze configuration, please let me know.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task:

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):**
   The empty spaces in the original maze form a diagonal line or a "staircase" shape, moving from the bottom right to the top left.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**
   Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar "staircase" shape for the empty spaces, ensuring there is a valid path from the player position to the goal.

   **New Maze Configuration:**

   - **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
   - **Empty:** (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)
   - **Player position:** (6, 4)
   - **Goal:** (4, 6)

   In this new configuration, the empty spaces still form a diagonal "staircase" shape, but the player can now move from (6, 4) to (5, 5) and then to (4, 6) to reach the goal.
