You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (1, 3) to the goal at (1, 1) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 3)
2. **Goal Position**: (1, 1)

From (1, 3), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- (0, 4) - Move up and right
- (2, 2) - Move down and left
- (3, 3) - Move down

Since we need to move towards (1, 1), let's choose the move that brings us closer to the goal. Moving to (2, 2) seems like a good option because it allows us to potentially move to (3, 1) next, which is closer to the goal.

**Next Move**: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 1). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (2, 2)
2. **Goal Position**: (1, 1)

From (2, 2), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- (1, 3) - Move up
- (3, 1) - Move down and left

Moving to (3, 1) is a good option because it brings us closer to the goal at (1, 1).

**Next Move**: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 1), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 1). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (3, 1)
2. **Goal Position**: (1, 1)

From (3, 1), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- (2, 2) - Move up and right
- (3, 3) - Move right

However, neither of these moves directly brings us closer to the goal. Let's reconsider the path and try to backtrack to find a better route. We should move back to (2, 2) to explore other potential paths.

**Next Move**: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's reassess the situation to find a path to the goal at (1, 1) from the current position (2, 2).

1. **Current Position**: (2, 2)
2. **Goal Position**: (1, 1)

From (2, 2), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- (1, 3) - Move up
- (3, 1) - Move down and left

Since moving to (3, 1) did not help us previously, let's try moving to (1, 3) to explore other potential paths.

**Next Move**: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 3), we need to find a path to the goal at (1, 1). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 3)
2. **Goal Position**: (1, 1)

From (1, 3), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- (2, 2) - Move down and left

Since moving to (2, 2) and (3, 1) did not help us previously, let's try a different approach. We need to find a way to reach (1, 1) by exploring other potential paths. However, given the current configuration, it seems there might be no direct path to the goal from the available empty spaces.

Let's try moving to (0, 4) to explore if there is any potential path from there.

**Next Move**: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 4), we need to find a path to the goal at (1, 1). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (0, 4)
2. **Goal Position**: (1, 1)

From (0, 4), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- (1, 3) - Move down and left

Since moving to (1, 3) previously did not help us reach the goal, let's reconsider the overall path. It seems that the configuration of walls and empty spaces does not provide a direct path to the goal at (1, 1) from the available empty spaces.

Given the current configuration, it appears that there is no valid path to reach the goal at (1, 1) from the starting position (1, 3) using the available empty spaces. If there are any additional empty spaces or if the configuration changes, please let me know so we can reassess the path.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's carefully analyze the maze again to find a path to the goal at (1, 1) from the current position (1, 3).

1. **Current Position**: (1, 3)
2. **Goal Position**: (1, 1)

From (1, 3), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- (2, 2) - Move down and left

Since moving to (2, 2) and then to (3, 1) did not help us reach the goal, let's try a different approach. We need to explore the possibility of reaching the goal by backtracking and trying different paths.

Let's move back to (2, 2) and explore other potential paths from there.

Player position: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the previous confusion. Let's carefully analyze the maze again to find a path to the goal at (1, 1) from the current position (3, 1).

1. **Current Position**: (3, 1)
2. **Goal Position**: (1, 1)

From (3, 1), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- (2, 2) - Move up and right
- (3, 3) - Move right

Since moving to (2, 2) and (3, 3) previously did not help us reach the goal, let's reconsider the overall path. It seems that the configuration of walls and empty spaces does not provide a direct path to the goal at (1, 1) from the available empty spaces.

Given the current configuration, it appears that there is no valid path to reach the goal at (1, 1) from the starting position (1, 3) using the available empty spaces. If there are any additional empty spaces or if the configuration changes, please let me know so we can reassess the path.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze. The empty spaces in the original maze are:

- (0, 0)
- (0, 4)
- (1, 3)
- (2, 2)
- (3, 1)
- (3, 3)
- (4, 0)
- (4, 4)

These coordinates form a diagonal zigzag pattern, which can be described as a "Z" shape.

Now, let's create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form a similar "Z" shape. The new maze should have a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G).

### New Maze Configuration

**Walls:**
- (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6)
- (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)
- (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)
- (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
- (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)
- (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
- (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

**Empty:**
- (0, 0)
- (1, 1)
- (2, 2)
- (3, 3)
- (4, 4)
- (5, 5)
- (6, 6)

**Player Position:**
- (0, 0)

**Goal:**
- (6, 6)

This new maze maintains the "Z" shape pattern with a valid path from the player position to the goal.
