You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (2, 3) to the goal position (4, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (2, 3)
2. **Goal Position**: (4, 3)

From (2, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up to (1, 3) - which is an empty space.
- Down to (3, 3) - which is an empty space.
- Left to (2, 2) - which is a wall.
- Right to (2, 4) - which is a wall.

The best move is to go down to (3, 3) since it brings us closer to the goal.

**Next Move**: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal (4, 3):

1. **Current Position**: (3, 3)
2. **Goal Position**: (4, 3)

From (3, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up to (2, 3) - which is an empty space.
- Down to (4, 3) - which is the goal.
- Left to (3, 2) - which is a wall.
- Right to (3, 4) - which is a wall.

The best move is to go down to (4, 3) since it is the goal position.

**Next Move**: (4, 3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

The empty spaces in the original maze are:
- (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)
- (2, 3)
- (3, 3)
- (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)

These empty spaces form a shape that resembles the letter "T". The vertical part of the "T" is formed by the spaces (2, 3) and (3, 3), and the horizontal part is formed by the spaces in row 1 and row 4.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7) with a different configuration of walls and empty spaces, but maintaining the "T" shape for the empty spaces.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty**: (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)

- **Player Position**: (2, 3)

- **Goal**: (4, 3)

This new configuration maintains the "T" shape of the empty spaces while ensuring a valid path from the player position to the goal.
