You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (2, 3) to the goal position (4, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. From (2, 3), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (1, 3), but it's a wall.
   - Down to (3, 3), but it's a wall.
   - Left to (2, 2), which is an empty space.
   - Right to (2, 4), but it's a wall.

The only valid move is to the left, to the empty space at (2, 2).

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (1, 2), but it's a wall.
2. Down to (3, 2), but it's a wall.
3. Left to (2, 1), which is an empty space.
4. Right to (2, 3), which is an empty space.

We can move to either (2, 1) or (2, 3). To progress towards the goal at (4, 3), moving to (2, 3) seems more promising as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves again:

1. Up to (1, 3), but it's a wall.
2. Down to (3, 3), but it's a wall.
3. Left to (2, 2), which is an empty space.
4. Right to (2, 4), but it's a wall.

The only valid move is to the left, to the empty space at (2, 2).

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (1, 2), but it's a wall.
2. Down to (3, 2), but it's a wall.
3. Left to (2, 1), which is an empty space.
4. Right to (2, 3), which is an empty space.

Previously, moving to (2, 3) did not lead us closer to the goal, so let's try a different path. We can move to (2, 1) to explore a new route.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (1, 1), but it's a wall.
2. Down to (3, 1), which is an empty space.
3. Left to (2, 0), but it's a wall.
4. Right to (2, 2), which is an empty space.

To progress towards the goal at (4, 3), moving down to (3, 1) seems promising as it opens up new paths.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (2, 1), which is an empty space.
2. Down to (4, 1), which is an empty space.
3. Left to (3, 0), but it's a wall.
4. Right to (3, 2), but it's a wall.

To progress towards the goal at (4, 3), moving down to (4, 1) seems promising as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (3, 1), which is an empty space.
2. Down to (5, 1), but it's a wall.
3. Left to (4, 0), but it's a wall.
4. Right to (4, 2), which is an empty space.

To progress towards the goal at (4, 3), moving right to (4, 2) is a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (3, 2), but it's a wall.
2. Down to (5, 2), but it's a wall.
3. Left to (4, 1), which is an empty space.
4. Right to (4, 3), which is the goal.

The goal is directly to the right of the current position. Therefore, the next move is to (4, 3), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape resembling a "Z" or zigzag pattern. The path starts at the top, moves diagonally down to the left, then diagonally down to the right, and finally moves horizontally to the goal.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces. The player will start at a new position, and the goal will be at a new position, but the path will still form a "Z" shape.

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:** (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

- **Player position:** (2, 2)

- **Goal:** (4, 4)

This new maze maintains the "Z" shape of the empty spaces, providing a valid path from the player position to the goal.
