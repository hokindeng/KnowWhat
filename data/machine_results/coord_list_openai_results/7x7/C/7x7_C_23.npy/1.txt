You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (5, 3) to the goal at (0, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. From (5, 3), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (4, 3), but it's a wall.
   - Down to (6, 3), but it's a wall.
   - Left to (5, 2), which is an empty space.
   - Right to (5, 4), which is an empty space.

Since we cannot move up or down due to walls, we can move either left or right. Let's move right to (5, 4) as it seems to be a step towards the goal.

The next move is to (5, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (4, 4), but it's a wall.
2. Down to (6, 4), but it's a wall.
3. Left to (5, 3), which is an empty space.
4. Right to (5, 5), which is an empty space.

Since moving up or down is not possible due to walls, we can move either left or right. Let's move right to (5, 5) to continue exploring the path towards the goal.

The next move is to (5, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 5), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (4, 5), but it's a wall.
2. Down to (6, 5), but it's a wall.
3. Left to (5, 4), which is an empty space.
4. Right to (5, 6), which is an empty space.

Since moving up or down is not possible due to walls, we can move either left or right. Let's move right to (5, 6) to continue exploring the path towards the goal.

The next move is to (5, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

1. Up to (4, 6), but it's a wall.
2. Down to (6, 6), but it's a wall.
3. Left to (5, 5), which is an empty space.
4. Right is not possible as it is outside the maze bounds.

The only valid move is to go left to (5, 5).

The next move is to (5, 5).

2. Down to (6, 5), but it's a wall.
3. Left to (5, 4), which is an empty space.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern involves a series of connected horizontal and vertical segments that create a winding path through the maze.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar "zigzag" pattern for the empty spaces. We'll ensure that there is a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G).

**New Maze:**

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
- **Empty:** (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 4)
- **Player position:** (6, 2)
- **Goal:** (0, 6)

This new maze maintains the "zigzag" pattern of empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal while differing from the original maze layout.
