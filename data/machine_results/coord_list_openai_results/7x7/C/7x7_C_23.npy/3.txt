You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (5, 3) to the goal at (0, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's find the next move.

The current position is (5, 3). From here, we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are:

- Up to (4, 3), but this is a wall.
- Down to (6, 3), but this is a wall.
- Left to (5, 2), which is an empty space.
- Right to (5, 4), which is an empty space.

Since moving left to (5, 2) or right to (5, 4) are the only valid moves, let's choose to move right to (5, 4) as it seems to lead us closer to the goal.

The next move is to (5, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is currently at position (5, 4). From here, we need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (4, 4), but this is a wall.
- Down to (6, 4), but this is a wall.
- Left to (5, 3), which is an empty space.
- Right to (5, 5), which is an empty space.

Since moving left to (5, 3) would take us back to the previous position, let's move right to (5, 5) to continue exploring new paths.

The next move is to (5, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is currently at position (5, 5). From here, we need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (4, 5), but this is a wall.
- Down to (6, 5), but this is a wall.
- Left to (5, 4), which is an empty space.
- Right to (5, 6), which is an empty space.

Since moving left to (5, 4) would take us back to the previous position, let's move right to (5, 6) to continue exploring new paths.

The next move is to (5, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is currently at position (5, 6). From here, we need to find a path towards the goal at (0, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (4, 6), but this is a wall.
- Down to (6, 6), but this is a wall.
- Left to (5, 5), which is an empty space.

The only valid move is to go left to (5, 5), which is an empty space. Although this takes us back to a previous position, it seems necessary to explore other paths.

The next move is to (5, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player is currently at position (5, 5). We need to find a path towards the goal at (0, 3). Let's evaluate the possible moves again:

- Up to (4, 5), but this is a wall.
- Down to (6, 5), but this is a wall.
- Left to (5, 4), which is an empty space.
- Right to (5, 6), which is an empty space.

Since moving right to (5, 6) leads to a dead end, let's move left to (5, 4) to explore other paths.

The next move is to (5, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern is characterized by a series of connected horizontal and vertical segments that create a path with turns.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape
Let's create a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The maze will have a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G).

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
- **Empty:** (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 4)
- **Player position:** (6, 2)
- **Goal:** (0, 6)

This new maze maintains the "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern of empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal.
