You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (6, 3) to the goal position (0, 5) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's find the next move.

The current position is (6, 3). From here, the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:

- Up to (5, 3) - This is a wall.
- Down to (7, 3) - This is outside the grid.
- Left to (6, 2) - This is an empty space.
- Right to (6, 4) - This is an empty space.

The best move is to go right to (6, 4), as it brings us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (6, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

- Up to (5, 4) - This is a wall.
- Down to (7, 4) - This is outside the grid.
- Left to (6, 3) - This is an empty space.
- Right to (6, 5) - This is an empty space.

The best move is to go right to (6, 5), as it continues to bring us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (6, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6, 5), let's evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

- Up to (5, 5) - This is a wall.
- Down to (7, 5) - This is outside the grid.
- Left to (6, 4) - This is an empty space.
- Right to (6, 6) - This is an empty space.

The best move is to go right to (6, 6), as it continues to bring us closer to the goal.

So, the next move is to (6, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6, 6), let's evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

- Up to (5, 6) - This is a wall.
- Down to (7, 6) - This is outside the grid.
- Left to (6, 5) - This is an empty space.
- Right to (6, 7) - This is outside the grid.

The only valid move is to go left to (6, 5).

So, the next move is to (6, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

- Down to (7, 5) - This is outside the grid.
- Left to (6, 4) - This is an empty space.
- Right to (6, 6) - This is an empty space.

Since moving right to (6, 6) leads to a dead end, let's move left to (6, 4) to explore a different path.

So, the next move is to (6, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "snake-like" path. This path winds through the grid, creating a single continuous corridor that moves up and down as it progresses horizontally.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar "zigzag" path. The new maze will have a different configuration of walls and empty spaces but will maintain the zigzag pattern.

- **Walls:** (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5)
- **Empty:** (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
- **Player position:** (6, 0)
- **Goal:** (0, 6)

This new maze maintains the zigzag pattern, providing a continuous path from the player position to the goal. The path moves horizontally and vertically, similar to the original maze's shape.
