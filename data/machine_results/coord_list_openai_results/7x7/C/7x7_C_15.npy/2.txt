You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (6, 3) to the goal position (0, 5) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's find the next move.

The current position is (6, 3). From here, we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are:

- Up to (5, 3), but this is a wall.
- Down is not possible as it would go out of bounds.
- Left to (6, 2), which is an empty space.
- Right to (6, 4), which is an empty space.

To move towards the goal at (0, 5), moving right to (6, 4) seems like a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (6, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current player position is (6, 4), and the goal is at (0, 5). From (6, 4), we can move to the following adjacent empty spaces:

- Up to (5, 4), but this is a wall.
- Down is not possible as it would go out of bounds.
- Left to (6, 3), which is an empty space.
- Right to (6, 5), which is an empty space.

Moving right to (6, 5) is a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (6, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

Player position: (6, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current player position is (6, 5), and the goal is at (0, 5). From (6, 5), we can move to the following adjacent empty spaces:

- Up to (5, 5), but this is a wall.
- Down is not possible as it would go out of bounds.
- Left to (6, 4), which is an empty space.
- Right to (6, 6), which is an empty space.

Moving right to (6, 6) is a good choice as it allows us to continue moving towards the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (6, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current player position is (6, 6), and the goal is at (0, 5). From (6, 6), we can move to the following adjacent empty spaces:

- Up to (5, 6), but this is a wall.
- Down is not possible as it would go out of bounds.
- Left to (6, 5), which is an empty space.
- Right is not possible as it would go out of bounds.

The only valid move is to go left to (6, 5).

Therefore, the next move is to (6, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

- Down is not possible as it would go out of bounds.
- Left to (6, 4), which is an empty space.
- Right to (6, 6), which is an empty space.

Since moving right to (6, 6) did not help us progress towards the goal, let's try moving left to (6, 4) and explore a different path.

Therefore, the next move is to (6, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

Since moving right to (6, 5) previously did not help us progress towards the goal, let's try moving left to (6, 3) and explore a different path.

Therefore, the next move is to (6, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "spiral" or "snail shell" pattern. The path starts at the bottom and spirals inward towards the top, creating a winding corridor.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar spiral pattern of empty spaces. The new maze will have a different configuration of walls and empty spaces but will maintain the spiral shape.

**New Maze Configuration:**

- **Walls:** (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1)
- **Empty:** (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2)
- **Player position:** (6, 0)
- **Goal:** (0, 0)

This new maze maintains the spiral shape, starting from the bottom left and spiraling inward to the top left, while providing a valid path from the player position to the goal.
