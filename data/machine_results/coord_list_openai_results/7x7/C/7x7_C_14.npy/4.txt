You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position to the goal position by moving through empty spaces. The player starts at position (0, 1), and the goal is at position (4, 3).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (0, 1):

1. **Up**: (0, 1) -> (-1, 1) (out of bounds, not possible)
2. **Down**: (0, 1) -> (1, 1) (wall, not possible)
3. **Left**: (0, 1) -> (0, 0) (empty, possible)
4. **Right**: (0, 1) -> (0, 2) (empty, possible)

From (0, 1), we can move either left to (0, 0) or right to (0, 2). To make progress towards the goal, moving right to (0, 2) seems more promising.

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (0, 2) -> (-1, 2) (out of bounds, not possible)
2. **Down**: (0, 2) -> (1, 2) (wall, not possible)
3. **Left**: (0, 2) -> (0, 1) (empty, possible)
4. **Right**: (0, 2) -> (0, 3) (empty, possible)

To continue making progress towards the goal, moving right to (0, 3) is a good choice.

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (0, 3) -> (-1, 3) (out of bounds, not possible)
2. **Down**: (0, 3) -> (1, 3) (wall, not possible)
3. **Left**: (0, 3) -> (0, 2) (empty, possible)
4. **Right**: (0, 3) -> (0, 4) (wall, not possible)

The only possible move from (0, 3) is to go left to (0, 2). However, to make progress towards the goal, we need to find a path that eventually leads downwards. Let's backtrack to (0, 2) and explore other options from there.

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves again:

1. **Up**: (0, 2) -> (-1, 2) (out of bounds, not possible)
2. **Down**: (0, 2) -> (1, 2) (wall, not possible)
3. **Left**: (0, 2) -> (0, 1) (empty, possible)
4. **Right**: (0, 2) -> (0, 3) (empty, possible)

Since moving right to (0, 3) did not lead to progress towards the goal, let's try moving left to (0, 1) and explore further from there.

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (0, 1) -> (-1, 1) (out of bounds, not possible)
2. **Down**: (0, 1) -> (1, 1) (wall, not possible)
3. **Left**: (0, 1) -> (0, 0) (empty, possible)
4. **Right**: (0, 1) -> (0, 2) (empty, possible)

Since moving right to (0, 2) and then to (0, 3) did not lead to progress towards the goal, let's try moving left to (0, 0) and explore further from there.

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (0, 0) -> (-1, 0) (out of bounds, not possible)
2. **Down**: (0, 0) -> (1, 0) (empty, possible)
3. **Left**: (0, 0) -> (-1, 0) (out of bounds, not possible)
4. **Right**: (0, 0) -> (0, 1) (empty, possible)

To make progress towards the goal, moving down to (1, 0) seems promising, as it allows us to explore further down the grid.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (1, 0) -> (0, 0) (empty, possible)
2. **Down**: (1, 0) -> (2, 0) (empty, possible)
3. **Left**: (1, 0) -> (1, -1) (out of bounds, not possible)
4. **Right**: (1, 0) -> (1, 1) (wall, not possible)

To continue making progress towards the goal, moving down to (2, 0) is a good choice.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (2, 0) -> (1, 0) (empty, possible)
2. **Down**: (2, 0) -> (3, 0) (empty, possible)
3. **Left**: (2, 0) -> (2, -1) (out of bounds, not possible)
4. **Right**: (2, 0) -> (2, 1) (wall, not possible)

To continue making progress towards the goal, moving down to (3, 0) is a good choice.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 0), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (3, 0) -> (2, 0) (empty, possible)
2. **Down**: (3, 0) -> (4, 0) (empty, possible)
3. **Left**: (3, 0) -> (3, -1) (out of bounds, not possible)
4. **Right**: (3, 0) -> (3, 1) (wall, not possible)

To continue making progress towards the goal, moving down to (4, 0) is a good choice.

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 0).

3. **Left**: (4, 0) -> (4, -1) (out of bounds, not possible)
4. **Right**: (4, 0) -> (4, 1) (empty, possible)

To continue making progress towards the goal, moving right to (4, 1) is a good choice.

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 1).

The goal is directly to the right at (4, 3). Therefore, the next move is to (4, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The path moves downwards and to the right, creating a series of steps.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern:

- **Walls**: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty**: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5)

- **Player position**: (0, 0)

- **Goal**: (4, 5)

This new maze maintains the "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern, with a path that moves downwards and to the right, but it is not identical to the original maze.
