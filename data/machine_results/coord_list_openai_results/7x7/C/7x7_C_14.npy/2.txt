You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (0, 1) to the goal at (4, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (0, 1)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
   - Down: (1, 1) - This is a wall.
   - Left: (0, 0) - This is an empty space.
   - Right: (0, 2) - This is an empty space.

Given the options, we can move to either (0, 0) or (0, 2). To progress towards the goal, moving to (0, 2) seems more promising as it keeps us on the path towards the goal.

**Next Move**: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (0, 2)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
   - Down: (1, 2) - This is a wall.
   - Left: (0, 1) - This is an empty space.
   - Right: (0, 3) - This is an empty space.

To continue progressing towards the goal, moving to (0, 3) is a good choice as it keeps us moving along the path.

**Next Move**: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (0, 3)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
   - Down: (1, 3) - This is a wall.
   - Left: (0, 2) - This is an empty space.
   - Right: (0, 4) - This is a wall.

The only viable move is to go back to (0, 2). However, to make progress towards the goal, we need to explore other paths. Let's backtrack to (0, 2) and then consider moving downwards through the available path.

**Next Move**: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves again:

1. **Current Position**: (0, 2)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up: (Not possible, as it would be out of bounds)
   - Down: (1, 2) - This is a wall.
   - Left: (0, 1) - This is an empty space.
   - Right: (0, 3) - This is an empty space.

Since moving to (0, 3) did not lead to progress, let's try a different path by moving left to (0, 1) and then explore moving downwards.

**Next Move**: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (0, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

   - Down: (1, 1) - This is a wall.
   - Left: (0, 0) - This is an empty space.
   - Right: (0, 2) - This is an empty space.

Since moving to (0, 2) and (0, 3) did not lead to progress, let's try moving left to (0, 0) and then explore moving downwards.

**Next Move**: (0, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape**: The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape resembling a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The path moves downwards and to the right, then downwards again, creating a zigzag pattern through the grid.

2. **New Maze**: Below is a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" pattern. The maze includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G).

- **Walls**: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
- **Empty**: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (6, 0)
- **Player Position**: (0, 0)
- **Goal**: (6, 0)

This new maze maintains the zigzag pattern while providing a different configuration of walls and empty spaces.
