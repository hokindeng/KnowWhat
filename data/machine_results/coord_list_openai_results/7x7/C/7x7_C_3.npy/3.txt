You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (5, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (3, 3) to the goal position (5, 1) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position:

1. **Current Position**: (3, 3)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (2, 3) - This is a wall.
   - Down to (4, 3) - This is a wall.
   - Left to (3, 2) - This is an empty space.
   - Right to (3, 4) - This is an empty space.

From (3, 3), we can move left to (3, 2) or right to (3, 4). To make progress towards the goal, let's move to (3, 4).

**Next Move**: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (5, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (3, 4)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (2, 4) - This is a wall.
   - Down to (4, 4) - This is a wall.
   - Left to (3, 3) - This is an empty space.
   - Right to (3, 5) - This is a wall.

The only valid move from (3, 4) is to go left to (3, 3).

**Next Move**: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (5, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's reevaluate the situation from the current position (3, 3) and find a path towards the goal (5, 1):

1. **Current Position**: (3, 3)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (2, 3) - This is a wall.
   - Down to (4, 3) - This is a wall.
   - Left to (3, 2) - This is an empty space.
   - Right to (3, 4) - This is an empty space.

Since moving to (3, 4) didn't help us progress towards the goal, let's try moving left to (3, 2) this time.

**Next Move**: (3, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "T" shape. The vertical part of the "T" is formed by the path from (3, 1) to (6, 1), and the horizontal part is formed by the path from (3, 1) to (3, 4).

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape
Let's create a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a "T" shape. The maze will have a valid path from a new player position to a new goal position.

#### New Maze Configuration
- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
- **Empty**: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3)
- **Player Position**: (3, 3)
- **Goal**: (6, 3)

This new maze maintains the "T" shape formed by the empty spaces, with a valid path from the player position to the goal.
