You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (1, 2) to the goal at (4, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 2)

   From (1, 2), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (0, 2), but it's a wall.
   - Down to (2, 2), but it's a wall.
   - Left to (1, 1), which is an empty space.
   - Right to (1, 3), which is an empty space.

Given these options, moving right to (1, 3) seems like a good step towards the goal. Let's make that move.

**Next Move**: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 3)

   From (1, 3), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (0, 3), but it's a wall.
   - Down to (2, 3), but it's a wall.
   - Left to (1, 2), which is an empty space.
   - Right to (1, 4), which is an empty space.

Moving right to (1, 4) brings us closer to the goal at (4, 3). Let's make that move.

**Next Move**: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 4)

   From (1, 4), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (0, 4), but it's a wall.
   - Down to (2, 4), but it's a wall.
   - Left to (1, 3), which is an empty space.
   - Right to (1, 5), but it's a wall.

The only viable move is to go left to (1, 3), but since we have already been there, we need to find a new path. Let's backtrack and explore a different route from (1, 3).

**Next Move**: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 3), let's explore a different path to reach the goal:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 3)

   From (1, 3), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (0, 3), but it's a wall.
   - Down to (2, 3), but it's a wall.
   - Left to (1, 2), which is an empty space.
   - Right to (1, 4), which is an empty space.

Since moving right to (1, 4) leads to a dead end, let's try moving left to (1, 2) and explore from there.

**Next Move**: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 2), let's explore a new path to reach the goal:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 2)

   From (1, 2), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (0, 2), but it's a wall.
   - Down to (2, 2), but it's a wall.
   - Left to (1, 1), which is an empty space.
   - Right to (1, 3), which is an empty space.

Since moving right to (1, 3) leads back to a path we've already explored, let's try moving left to (1, 1) and explore from there.

**Next Move**: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 1), let's explore the possible moves to find a path to the goal:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 1)

   From (1, 1), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (0, 1), but it's a wall.
   - Down to (2, 1), which is an empty space.
   - Left to (1, 0), but it's a wall.
   - Right to (1, 2), which is an empty space.

Moving down to (2, 1) opens up a new path that we haven't explored yet. Let's make that move.

**Next Move**: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves to continue towards the goal:

1. **Current Position**: (2, 1)

   From (2, 1), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (1, 1), which is an empty space.
   - Down to (3, 1), which is an empty space.
   - Left to (2, 0), but it's a wall.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape**: The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The path moves downwards and to the right, then back to the left, and so on, creating a zigzag pattern through the maze.

2. **New Maze**: Below is a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with empty spaces forming a similar zigzag pattern. The maze includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G).

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty**: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)

- **Player Position**: (1, 1)

- **Goal**: (4, 4)

This new maze maintains the zigzag pattern of empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal.
