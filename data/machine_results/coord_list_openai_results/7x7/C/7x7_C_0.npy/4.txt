You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (1, 2) to the goal at (4, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 2)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up: (0, 2) - This is a wall.
   - Down: (2, 2) - This is a wall.
   - Left: (1, 1) - This is an empty space.
   - Right: (1, 3) - This is an empty space.

Given the options, we can move to either (1, 1) or (1, 3). To progress towards the goal, moving to (1, 3) seems more promising as it keeps us closer to the goal's row.

**Next Move**: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 3)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up: (0, 3) - This is a wall.
   - Down: (2, 3) - This is a wall.
   - Left: (1, 2) - This is an empty space.
   - Right: (1, 4) - This is an empty space.

To continue progressing towards the goal at (4, 3), moving to (1, 4) is a good choice as it keeps us moving in the right direction.

**Next Move**: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 4)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up: (0, 4) - This is a wall.
   - Down: (2, 4) - This is a wall.
   - Left: (1, 3) - This is an empty space.
   - Right: (1, 5) - This is a wall.

The only viable move is to go back to (1, 3). However, to make progress towards the goal, we need to explore other paths. Let's backtrack to (1, 3) and then consider moving downwards.

**Next Move**: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 3), let's explore a different path to reach the goal:

1. **Current Position**: (1, 3)

   - Up: (0, 3) - This is a wall.
   - Down: (2, 3) - This is a wall.
   - Left: (1, 2) - This is an empty space.
   - Right: (1, 4) - This is an empty space.

   - Down: (2, 2) - This is a wall.
   - Left: (1, 1) - This is an empty space.
   - Right: (1, 3) - This is an empty space.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The path moves downwards and to the right, then downwards again, creating a zigzagging corridor.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape
Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar zigzag pattern for the empty spaces. We'll ensure that there is a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G).

#### New Maze Configuration
- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
- **Empty**: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
- **Player Position**: (1, 1)
- **Goal**: (4, 4)

This new maze maintains the zigzag pattern of the empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal.
