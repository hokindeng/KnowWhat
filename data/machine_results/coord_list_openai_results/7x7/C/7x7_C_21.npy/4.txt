You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (5, 4) to the goal position at (3, 5) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. From (5, 4), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (4, 4) (an empty space)
   - Right to (5, 5) (an empty space)

Moving up to (4, 4) seems to be a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal. Let's make that move.

The next move is to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 4), (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (4, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (3, 4) (an empty space)
2. Right to (4, 5) (a wall, so not possible)
3. Down to (5, 4) (an empty space, but moving back)
4. Left to (4, 3) (a wall, so not possible)

Moving up to (3, 4) is a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal. Let's make that move.

The next move is to (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (3, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. Up to (2, 4) (a wall, so not possible)
2. Right to (3, 5) (the goal position)
3. Down to (4, 4) (an empty space, but moving back)
4. Left to (3, 3) (a wall, so not possible)

Moving right to (3, 5) will take us directly to the goal. Let's make that move.

The next move is to (3, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form an "L" shape.

2. **New Maze with the Same "L" Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a different configuration of walls and empty spaces, but maintaining the "L" shape for the path. The player position (P) and goal (G) will also be different from the original maze.

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:** (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5)

- **Player Position:** (5, 5)

- **Goal:** (3, 6)

This new maze maintains the "L" shape of the empty spaces, with a path from the player position at (5, 5) to the goal at (3, 6).
