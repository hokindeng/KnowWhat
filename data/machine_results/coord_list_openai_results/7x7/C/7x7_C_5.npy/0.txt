You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (5, 6) to the goal position (5, 4) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. From (5, 6), the possible moves are:
   - Left to (5, 5) (an empty space)
   - Up to (4, 6) (a wall, not possible)
   - Down to (6, 6) (a wall, not possible)
   - Right is out of bounds

The only valid move is to the left, to (5, 5).

Therefore, the next move is to (5, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (5, 5), we need to move towards the goal at (5, 4). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (5, 5), the possible moves are:
   - Left to (5, 4) (the goal position)
   - Up to (4, 5) (a wall, not possible)
   - Down to (6, 5) (a wall, not possible)
   - Right to (5, 6) (an empty space, but moving away from the goal)

The optimal move is to the left, to (5, 4), which is the goal position.

Therefore, the next move is to (5, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "T" shape. The path starts at the bottom of the "T" and extends upwards, with a horizontal line at the top.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a "T" shape:

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty**: (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4)

- **Player position**: (5, 3)

- **Goal**: (1, 4)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a "T" shape, with the vertical path extending from (5, 3) to (1, 3), and the horizontal path at the top from (1, 3) to (1, 4). The player starts at the bottom of the "T" and can reach the goal at the top right of the "T".
