You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (1, 5) to the goal position (3, 6) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. From (1, 5), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (0, 5), but it's a wall.
   - Down to (2, 5), which is an empty space.
   - Left to (1, 4), which is an empty space.
   - Right to (1, 6), which is an empty space.

To move towards the goal, let's choose the move that brings us closer to the goal. Moving right to (1, 6) is a good choice because it keeps us on the path towards the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 6), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 6). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (1, 6), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (0, 6), but it's a wall.
   - Down to (2, 6), but it's a wall.
   - Left to (1, 5), which is an empty space.
   - Right to (2, 6), but it's a wall.

Since moving left to (1, 5) is the only valid move that keeps us on the path, let's move back to (1, 5) and reassess our options from there.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's reassess the situation from the current player position (1, 5) to find a path to the goal (3, 6).

From (1, 5), the possible moves are:
- Up to (0, 5), but it's a wall.
- Down to (2, 5), which is a wall.
- Left to (1, 4), which is an empty space.
- Right to (1, 6), which is an empty space.

Since moving right to (1, 6) didn't help us progress towards the goal, let's try moving left to (1, 4) and explore a different path.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 4), let's explore the possible moves to find a path to the goal (3, 6):

1. From (1, 4), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (0, 4), but it's a wall.
   - Down to (2, 4), which is an empty space.
   - Left to (1, 3), but it's a wall.
   - Right to (1, 5), which is an empty space.

To make progress towards the goal, let's move down to (2, 4), which is an empty space and seems to lead us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves to continue towards the goal (3, 6):

1. From (2, 4), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (1, 4), which is an empty space.
   - Down to (3, 4), which is an empty space.
   - Left to (2, 3), but it's a wall.
   - Right to (2, 5), but it's a wall.

Moving down to (3, 4) is a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal (3, 6):

1. From (3, 4), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (2, 4), which is an empty space.
   - Down to (4, 4), but it's a wall.
   - Left to (3, 3), but it's a wall.
   - Right to (3, 5), which is an empty space.

Moving right to (3, 5) is a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 5), we are very close to the goal at (3, 6). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (3, 5), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (2, 5), but it's a wall.
   - Down to (4, 5), but it's a wall.
   - Left to (3, 4), which is an empty space.
   - Right to (3, 6), which is the goal.

Moving right to (3, 6) will take us directly to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 6).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze resembles a "T" shape.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a "T" shape. The maze includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G):

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty**: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)

- **Player position**: (1, 4)

- **Goal**: (3, 6)

This new maze maintains the "T" shape of the empty spaces while providing a different configuration from the original maze.
