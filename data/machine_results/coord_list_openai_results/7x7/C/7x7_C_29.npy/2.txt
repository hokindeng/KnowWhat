You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (1, 5) to the goal position (3, 6) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. From (1, 5), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (0, 5), but it's a wall.
   - Down to (2, 5), but it's a wall.
   - Left to (1, 4), which is an empty space.
   - Right to (1, 6), which is an empty space.

The best move is to go right to (1, 6), as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 6), we need to find a path to the goal position (3, 6). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (1, 6), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (0, 6), but it's a wall.
   - Down to (2, 6), but it's a wall.
   - Left to (1, 5), which is an empty space.
   - Right to (2, 6), but it's a wall.

Since moving right is not possible, the best move is to go left to (1, 5) to explore other paths.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's reevaluate the situation to find a path to the goal position (3, 6) from the current player position (1, 5):

1. From (1, 5), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (0, 5), but it's a wall.
   - Down to (2, 5), but it's a wall.
   - Left to (1, 4), which is an empty space.
   - Right to (1, 6), which is an empty space.

Since moving right to (1, 6) didn't help us progress towards the goal, let's try moving left to (1, 4) to explore a different path.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 4), let's explore the possible moves to find a path to the goal position (3, 6):

1. From (1, 4), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (0, 4), but it's a wall.
   - Down to (2, 4), which is an empty space.
   - Left to (1, 3), but it's a wall.
   - Right to (1, 5), which is an empty space.

Moving down to (2, 4) seems promising as it opens up new paths to explore.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves to continue towards the goal position (3, 6):

1. From (2, 4), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (1, 4), which is an empty space.
   - Down to (3, 4), which is an empty space.
   - Left to (2, 3), but it's a wall.
   - Right to (2, 5), but it's a wall.

Moving down to (3, 4) is a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal position (3, 6):

1. From (3, 4), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (2, 4), which is an empty space.
   - Down to (4, 4), but it's a wall.
   - Left to (3, 3), but it's a wall.
   - Right to (3, 5), which is an empty space.

Moving right to (3, 5) is the best choice as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 5), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal position (3, 6):

1. From (3, 5), the possible moves are:
   - Up to (2, 5), but it's a wall.
   - Down to (4, 5), but it's a wall.
   - Left to (3, 4), which is an empty space.
   - Right to (3, 6), which is the goal position.

Moving right to (3, 6) will take us directly to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 6).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

The empty spaces in the original maze are: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5). These coordinates form a shape that resembles the letter "T" when visualized on the grid.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a different configuration of walls and empty spaces, but maintaining the "T" shape for the empty spaces. We'll also ensure there's a valid path from the player position to the goal.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:** (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)

- **Player position:** (3, 4)

- **Goal:** (1, 4)

This new configuration maintains the "T" shape of the empty spaces and provides a valid path from the player position to the goal. The player can move from (3, 4) to (1, 4) by going up through the empty spaces.
