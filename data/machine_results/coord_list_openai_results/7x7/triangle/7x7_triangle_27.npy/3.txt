You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (4, 4) to the goal at (4, 2) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's examine the possible moves from the current position:

Current position: (4, 4)

Possible moves from (4, 4) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (3, 3) is an empty space and can be reached by moving up-left.
- (3, 4) is an empty space and can be reached by moving up.
- (5, 3) is an empty space and can be reached by moving down-left.
- (5, 4) is an empty space and can be reached by moving down.

Since the goal is at (4, 2), we should aim to move towards it. Moving to (3, 3) or (3, 4) would bring us closer to the goal.

Let's move to (3, 4) as it is directly above the current position and brings us closer to the goal.

Next move: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position at (3, 4), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 2). Let's examine the possible moves:

Current position: (3, 4)

Possible moves from (3, 4) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (3, 3) is an empty space and can be reached by moving left.
- (3, 2) is an empty space and can be reached by moving left-down.
- (4, 4) is an empty space and can be reached by moving down.

To get closer to the goal at (4, 2), moving to (3, 3) or (3, 2) would be beneficial. Moving to (3, 2) is a more direct approach towards the goal.

Next move: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position at (3, 3), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 2). Let's examine the possible moves:

Current position: (3, 3)

Possible moves from (3, 3) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (3, 2) is an empty space and can be reached by moving left.
- (3, 4) is an empty space and can be reached by moving right.
- (4, 4) is an empty space and can be reached by moving down.

To get closer to the goal at (4, 2), moving to (3, 2) is the best option.

Next move: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position at (3, 2), we need to move to the goal at (4, 2). Let's examine the possible moves:

Current position: (3, 2)

Possible moves from (3, 2) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (3, 1) is an empty space and can be reached by moving left.
- (3, 3) is an empty space and can be reached by moving right.
- (4, 2) is the goal and can be reached by moving down.

Since (4, 2) is the goal position, we should move there directly.

Next move: (4, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape:**
   The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "T" or a "cross" shape. This is because the empty spaces create a vertical path intersecting with a horizontal path.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

   Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a "T" or "cross" shape formed by the empty spaces. The new maze will have a valid path from the player position to the goal position.

   **New Maze:**

   - **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)

   - **Empty:** (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3)

   - **Player position:** (4, 3)

   - **Goal:** (3, 2)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a "T" shape, with a vertical path intersecting a horizontal path. The player can move from (4, 3) to (3, 2) by moving up and then left, following the empty spaces.
