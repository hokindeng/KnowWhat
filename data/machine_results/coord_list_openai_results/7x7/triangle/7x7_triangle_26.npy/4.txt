You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (2, 5) to the goal position (5, 5) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. From (2, 5), the possible moves are:
   - Down to (3, 5) (an empty space)
   - Right to (2, 6) (a wall, not possible)
   - Left to (2, 4) (a wall, not possible)
   - Up to (1, 5) (a wall, not possible)
   - Diagonals:
     - Down-right to (3, 6) (a wall, not possible)
     - Down-left to (3, 4) (an empty space)
     - Up-right to (1, 6) (a wall, not possible)
     - Up-left to (1, 4) (a wall, not possible)

The viable moves are to (3, 5) or (3, 4). To get closer to the goal (5, 5), moving to (3, 5) seems more direct.

Let's move to (3, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 5), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal (5, 5):

1. From (3, 5), the possible moves are:
   - Down to (4, 5) (an empty space)
   - Right to (3, 6) (a wall, not possible)
   - Left to (3, 4) (an empty space)
   - Up to (2, 5) (an empty space, but moving back)
   - Diagonals:
     - Down-right to (4, 6) (a wall, not possible)
     - Down-left to (4, 4) (a wall, not possible)
     - Up-right to (2, 6) (a wall, not possible)
     - Up-left to (2, 4) (a wall, not possible)

The most direct move towards the goal is to move down to (4, 5).

Let's move to (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 5), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal (5, 5):

1. From (4, 5), the possible moves are:
   - Down to (5, 5) (the goal position)
   - Right to (4, 6) (a wall, not possible)
   - Left to (4, 4) (a wall, not possible)
   - Up to (3, 5) (an empty space, but moving back)
   - Diagonals:
     - Down-right to (5, 6) (a wall, not possible)
     - Down-left to (5, 4) (an empty space)
     - Up-right to (3, 6) (a wall, not possible)
     - Up-left to (3, 4) (an empty space, but moving back)

The most direct move to reach the goal is to move down to (5, 5).

Let's move to (5, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves diagonally and horizontally, creating a zigzagging corridor through the maze.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" pattern. The maze includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G):

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty**: (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)

- **Player position**: (2, 4)

- **Goal**: (5, 4)

This new maze maintains the zigzag pattern of the empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal.
