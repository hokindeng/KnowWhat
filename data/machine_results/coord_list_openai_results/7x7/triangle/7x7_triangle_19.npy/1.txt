You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (4, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (2, 5) to the goal at (4, 5) by moving through the empty spaces. The available empty spaces are: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 6), and (5, 6).

From the current position (2, 5), the possible moves are:
- (2, 4) to the left
- (2, 6) to the right

To move closer to the goal at (4, 5), we should move to (2, 4), which is directly adjacent to the current position and is an empty space.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (4, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 4), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 5). The available empty spaces from (2, 4) are:
- (2, 3) to the left
- (2, 5) to the right
- (3, 4) downwards

To make progress towards the goal, moving to (3, 4) is a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal position.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (4, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 4), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 5). The available empty spaces from (3, 4) are:
- (2, 4) upwards
- (3, 6) to the right

However, to move closer to the goal, we should consider moving diagonally to (4, 5), which is the goal position and is directly reachable from (3, 4).

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task:

1. **Name of the General Shape:**
   The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern is characterized by a series of connected diagonal and horizontal/vertical moves that create a zigzagging path through the maze.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

   Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar zigzag pattern for the empty spaces. The new maze will have a different configuration of walls and empty spaces but will maintain the zigzag pattern.

   **New Maze Configuration:**

   - **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

   - **Empty:** (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)

   - **Player Position:** (2, 5)

   - **Goal:** (4, 5)

   In this new configuration, the empty spaces still form a zigzag pattern, allowing a path from the player position at (2, 5) to the goal at (4, 5). The path involves moving left to (2, 4), then down to (3, 4), and finally diagonally to (4, 5).
