You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (1, 3) to the goal position (1, 5) by moving through the empty spaces. We can move in any of the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) as long as the destination is an empty space.

Let's examine the possible moves from the current position (1, 3):

1. **Up** to (0, 3) - This is a wall.
2. **Down** to (2, 3) - This is a wall.
3. **Left** to (1, 2) - This is an empty space.
4. **Right** to (1, 4) - This is an empty space.
5. **Up-Left** to (0, 2) - This is a wall.
6. **Up-Right** to (0, 4) - This is a wall.
7. **Down-Left** to (2, 2) - This is an empty space.
8. **Down-Right** to (2, 4) - This is an empty space.

The goal is at (1, 5), so moving right to (1, 4) is a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to the coordinate (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 4), we need to move to the goal position (1, 5). Let's examine the possible moves:

1. **Up** to (0, 4) - This is a wall.
2. **Down** to (2, 4) - This is an empty space.
3. **Left** to (1, 3) - This is an empty space.
4. **Right** to (1, 5) - This is the goal position.
5. **Up-Left** to (0, 3) - This is a wall.
6. **Up-Right** to (0, 5) - This is a wall.
7. **Down-Left** to (2, 3) - This is a wall.
8. **Down-Right** to (2, 5) - This is a wall.

The goal is directly to the right of the current position. Therefore, the next move is to the coordinate (1, 5), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

The empty spaces in the original maze are:
- (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)
- (2, 2), (2, 4)
- (3, 2), (3, 3)
- (4, 2)

These coordinates form a shape that resembles the letter "T". The vertical part of the "T" is formed by the column of empty spaces at x = 2, and the horizontal part is formed by the row of empty spaces at y = 1.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a "T" shape formed by the empty spaces. We'll ensure there's a valid path from the player position to the goal.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls**: 
  - (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)
  - (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6)
  - (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6)
  - (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
  - (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
  - (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
  - (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty Spaces**:
  - (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)
  - (2, 2), (2, 4)
  - (3, 2), (3, 3)
  - (4, 2)

- **Player Position**: (1, 3)
- **Goal**: (1, 4)

This new maze maintains the "T" shape of the empty spaces and provides a valid path from the player position to the goal.
