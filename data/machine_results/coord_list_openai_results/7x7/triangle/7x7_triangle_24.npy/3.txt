You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (5, 6) to the goal at (3, 5) by moving through the empty spaces. The available empty spaces are: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), and (6, 6).

From the current position (5, 6), the possible moves are:
- (4, 6) (up)
- (5, 5) (left)
- (6, 6) (down)

To move towards the goal at (3, 5), a good first move is to go to (4, 6), which is closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 6), the goal is to reach (3, 5). The available empty spaces are: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), and (6, 6).

From (4, 6), the possible moves are:
- (3, 6) (up)
- (4, 4) (left)
- (5, 6) (down)

To move closer to the goal at (3, 5), a good move is to go to (3, 6), which is directly above the current position.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 6), the goal is to reach (3, 5). The available empty spaces are: (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), and (6, 6).

From (3, 6), the possible moves are:
- (3, 5) (left)
- (4, 6) (down)

Since (3, 5) is the goal position, the best move is to go directly to (3, 5).

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape: "L-shape"**

The empty spaces in the original maze form an "L-shape" pattern, which can be seen as a path that moves in a straight line and then turns at a right angle.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with an "L-shape" path. The new maze will have a different configuration but maintain the L-shape pattern.

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
- **Empty:** (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 6)
- **Player position:** (6, 6)
- **Goal:** (3, 4)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form an "L-shape" that starts from the bottom right corner (6, 6), moves up to (3, 6), and then turns left to reach the goal at (3, 4).
