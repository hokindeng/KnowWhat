You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position to the goal, moving only through empty spaces and avoiding walls. The player's current position is (1, 4), and the goal is at (5, 0).

Let's consider the possible moves from the current position (1, 4):

1. Move up to (0, 4) - This is a wall.
2. Move down to (2, 4) - This is a wall.
3. Move left to (1, 3) - This is an empty space.
4. Move right to (1, 5) - This is a wall.
5. Move diagonally up-left to (0, 3) - This is a wall.
6. Move diagonally up-right to (0, 5) - This is a wall.
7. Move diagonally down-left to (2, 3) - This is an empty space.
8. Move diagonally down-right to (2, 5) - This is a wall.

The viable moves are to (1, 3) and (2, 3). To make progress towards the goal, let's move to (2, 3).

The next move is to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first analyze the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze. The empty spaces form a path that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern, moving diagonally downwards and to the left, then to the right, and so on.

### (1) General Shape
The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern.

### (2) New Maze
Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar zigzag pattern for the empty spaces. The new maze will have a valid path from the player position to the goal.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:** (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1)

- **Player position:** (1, 1)

- **Goal:** (5, 0)

This new maze maintains the zigzag pattern of empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal.
