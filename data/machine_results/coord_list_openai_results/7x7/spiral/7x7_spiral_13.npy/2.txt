You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (6, 2) to the goal at (2, 1) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's find the next move.

From the current position (6, 2), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up to (5, 2), but this is a wall.
- Down to (7, 2), but this is outside the grid.
- Left to (6, 1), which is an empty space.
- Right to (6, 3), which is an empty space.

To move towards the goal at (2, 1), moving left to (6, 1) seems like a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (6, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6, 1), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 1). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

From (6, 1), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up to (5, 1), which is an empty space.
- Down to (7, 1), but this is outside the grid.
- Left to (6, 0), but this is a wall.
- Right to (6, 2), which is an empty space.

To move closer to the goal, moving up to (5, 1) is a good choice.

Therefore, the next move is to (5, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 1), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 1). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

From (5, 1), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up to (4, 1), which is an empty space.
- Down to (6, 1), which is an empty space.
- Left to (5, 0), but this is a wall.
- Right to (5, 2), but this is a wall.

To move closer to the goal, moving up to (4, 1) is a good choice.

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 1), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 1). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

From (4, 1), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up to (3, 1), which is an empty space.
- Down to (5, 1), which is an empty space.
- Left to (4, 0), but this is a wall.
- Right to (4, 2), but this is a wall.

To move closer to the goal, moving up to (3, 1) is a good choice.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 1), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 1). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

From (3, 1), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- Up to (2, 1), which is the goal position.
- Down to (4, 1), which is an empty space.
- Left to (3, 0), but this is a wall.
- Right to (3, 2), but this is a wall.

Since moving up to (2, 1) will reach the goal, that is the best move.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "U" or a "C" shape. This is because the path starts at the bottom, goes up one side, and then comes back down the other side, creating a U-like corridor.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar "U" or "C" shape formed by the empty spaces. We'll ensure that there is a valid path from the player position to the goal.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
- **Empty:** (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5)
- **Player position:** (5, 3)
- **Goal:** (2, 3)

This new maze maintains the "U" shape of the empty spaces, with a path that starts at the bottom, goes up one side, and then comes back down the other side, allowing the player to reach the goal.
