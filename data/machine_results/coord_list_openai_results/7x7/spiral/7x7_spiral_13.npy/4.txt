You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (6, 2) to the goal position (2, 1) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's find a path step-by-step.

Starting at (6, 2), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are:

- Up to (5, 2) - but this is a wall.
- Down to (7, 2) - but this is outside the maze.
- Left to (6, 1) - this is an empty space.
- Right to (6, 3) - this is an empty space.

The best move to start with is to move right to (6, 3), as it keeps us moving towards the goal.

So, the next move is to (6, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (6, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (5, 3) - but this is a wall.
- Down to (7, 3) - but this is outside the maze.
- Left to (6, 2) - this is an empty space, but it takes us back to the previous position.
- Right to (6, 4) - this is an empty space.

The best move is to continue moving right to (6, 4), as it keeps us progressing through the maze.

So, the next move is to (6, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)

- Down to (5, 3) - but this is a wall.
- Left to (4, 2) - but this is a wall.
- Right to (4, 4) - but this is a wall.

It seems I made an error in the previous step. Let's backtrack to (3, 3) and find a new path from there.

From (3, 3), the possible moves are:

- Up to (2, 3) - but this is a wall.
- Down to (4, 3) - this is an empty space, but it takes us back to the previous position.
- Left to (3, 2) - but this is a wall.

Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's reevaluate the situation from the current position (3, 6) and find a path towards the goal (2, 1).

From (3, 6), the possible moves are:

- Up to (2, 6) - but this is a wall.
- Down to (4, 6) - this is an empty space.
- Left to (3, 5) - this is an empty space, but it takes us back to the previous position.
- Right to (3, 7) - but this is outside the maze.

The best move is to move down to (4, 6), as it keeps us exploring new paths towards the goal.

So, the next move is to (4, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)

Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the previous missteps. Let's find a more direct path to the goal from the current position (4, 6).

From (4, 6), the possible moves are:

- Up to (3, 6) - this is an empty space, but it takes us back to the previous position.
- Down to (5, 6) - this is an empty space.
- Left to (4, 5) - but this is a wall.
- Right to (4, 7) - but this is outside the maze.

The best move is to move down to (5, 6), as it keeps us exploring new paths towards the goal.

So, the next move is to (5, 6).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "spiral" or "snail shell" pattern. This pattern involves a winding path that loops around itself, creating a spiral-like corridor.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape
Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a spiral pattern of empty spaces. The new maze will have a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G) and will not be an identical copy of the original maze.

#### New Maze Encoding

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
- **Empty:** (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)
- **Player position:** (5, 1)
- **Goal:** (2, 3)

This new maze maintains a spiral-like pattern of empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal.
