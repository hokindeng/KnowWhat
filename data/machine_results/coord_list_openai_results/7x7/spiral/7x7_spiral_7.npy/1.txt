You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (4, 3) to the goal at (6, 5) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's find a path step-by-step.

Starting at (4, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 3)
- Down to (5, 3) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (4, 2) (but this is a wall)
- Right to (4, 4)

The only valid move is to the right, to (4, 4).

So, the next move is to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 4) (but this is a wall)
- Down to (5, 4) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (4, 3) (which is an empty space we just came from)
- Right to (4, 5) (which is an empty space)

The best move is to the right, to (4, 5).

So, the next move is to (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 5), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 5) (but this is a wall)
- Down to (5, 5) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (4, 4) (which is an empty space we just came from)
- Right to (4, 6) (which is an empty space)

The best move is to the right, to (4, 6).

So, the next move is to (4, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 6), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 6) (which is an empty space)
- Down to (5, 6) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (4, 5) (which is an empty space we just came from)
- Right to (5, 6) (but this is a wall)

The best move is down to (5, 6), but since it's a wall, we should move up to (3, 6).

So, the next move is to (3, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 6), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (2, 6) (which is an empty space)
- Down to (4, 6) (which is an empty space we just came from)
- Left to (3, 5) (but this is a wall)
- Right is not possible as it is outside the maze bounds

The best move is down to (4, 6), which is an empty space we just came from, but it allows us to continue towards the goal.

So, the next move is to (4, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 6), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 6) (which is an empty space we just came from)
- Down to (5, 6) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (4, 5) (which is an empty space)
- Right is not possible as it is outside the maze bounds

The best move is to the left, to (4, 5).

So, the next move is to (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 5), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 5) (but this is a wall)
- Down to (5, 5) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (4, 4) (which is an empty space)
- Right to (4, 6) (which is an empty space we just came from)

To make progress towards the goal, let's try a different approach. We need to find a path that leads us closer to the goal at (6, 5). Let's move back to (4, 4) and explore other paths.

So, the next move is to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 4) (but this is a wall)
- Down to (5, 4) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (4, 3) (which is an empty space)
- Right to (4, 5) (which is an empty space we just came from)

To find a path towards the goal, let's try moving left to (4, 3) and explore from there.

So, the next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 3) (which is an empty space)
- Down to (5, 3) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (4, 2) (but this is a wall)
- Right to (4, 4) (which is an empty space we just came from)

To explore a new path, let's move up to (3, 3).

So, the next move is to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (2, 3) (but this is a wall)
- Down to (4, 3) (which is an empty space we just came from)
- Left to (3, 2) (but this is a wall)
- Right to (3, 4) (but this is a wall)

It seems that moving to (3, 3) was not a productive choice. Let's backtrack to (4, 3) and try a different path.

So, the next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 3) (which is an empty space we just came from)
- Down to (5, 3) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (4, 2) (but this is a wall)
- Right to (4, 4) (which is an empty space)

Since moving to (3, 3) didn't help, let's move right to (4, 4) and explore further from there.

So, the next move is to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 4) (but this is a wall)
- Down to (5, 4) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (4, 3) (which is an empty space we just came from)
- Right to (4, 5) (which is an empty space)

Let's move right to (4, 5) and continue exploring from there.

So, the next move is to (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 5), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 5) (but this is a wall)
- Down to (5, 5) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (4, 4) (which is an empty space we just came from)
- Right to (4, 6) (which is an empty space)

Since moving to (4, 6) previously didn't help us reach the goal, let's try a different approach. We need to find a path that leads us closer to the goal at (6, 5). Let's backtrack and explore a different path.

Let's move left to (4, 4) and then explore further from there.

So, the next move is to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's try a different approach to find a path to the goal at (6, 5).

From the current position (4, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 4) (but this is a wall)
- Down to (5, 4) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (4, 3) (which is an empty space)
- Right to (4, 5) (which is an empty space we just came from)

Since we've been going in circles, let's try a new path. We need to move towards the bottom of the maze where there are more open spaces. Let's move left to (4, 3) and then explore further from there.

So, the next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's try a new approach to find a path to the goal at (6, 5). From the current position (4, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 3) (which is an empty space)
- Down to (5, 3) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (4, 2) (but this is a wall)
- Right to (4, 4) (which is an empty space we just came from)

Since moving to (3, 3) didn't help us previously, let's try moving down to (5, 1) by first moving left to (4, 1) and then down. This will allow us to explore the bottom row where there are more open spaces.

So, the next move is to (4, 1).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "U" or a "C" shape. This is because the path starts at the top, goes down one side, and then moves across the bottom, forming a "U" or "C" shape.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape
Let's create a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "U" or "C" shape. The maze will have a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G).

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
- **Empty:** (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
- **Player position:** (1, 1)
- **Goal:** (5, 5)

This new maze maintains the "U" or "C" shape of the corridors, with a path that starts at the top left, goes down the left side, and then moves across the bottom to reach the goal.
