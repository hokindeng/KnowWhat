You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (4, 3) to the goal at (6, 5) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's find a path step-by-step.

Starting at (4, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 3)
- Down to (5, 3) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (4, 2) (but this is a wall)
- Right to (4, 4)

The only valid move is to the right, to (4, 4).

Let's move to (4, 4).

The valid move that progresses towards the goal is down to (5, 6), but since it's a wall, we should move up to (3, 6).

Let's move to (3, 6).

- Left to (4, 5)
- Right is not possible as it is outside the maze bounds.

The valid move that progresses towards the goal is left to (4, 5).

Let's move to (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 5), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 5) (but this is a wall)
- Down to (5, 5) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (4, 4)
- Right to (4, 6)

Since we need to find a path to the goal at (6, 5), let's try a different approach. From (4, 5), let's move left to (4, 4) and then explore a path that leads us closer to the goal.

Let's move to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 4), let's consider the possible moves:

- Up to (3, 4) (but this is a wall)
- Down to (5, 4) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (4, 3)
- Right to (4, 5)

Since we've already explored the right path to (4, 5) and it didn't lead us to the goal, let's try moving left to (4, 3) and explore a different path.

Let's move to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 3), the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 3)
- Down to (5, 3) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (4, 2) (but this is a wall)
- Right to (4, 4)

Since moving right to (4, 4) leads us back to a previously explored path, let's try moving up to (3, 3) to explore a new path.

Let's move to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

- Up to (2, 3) (but this is a wall)
- Down to (4, 3)
- Left to (3, 2) (but this is a wall)
- Right to (3, 4) (but this is a wall)

The only valid move is to go back down to (4, 3), but since we've already been there, let's reconsider our path. 

Let's backtrack to (4, 3) and then try a different approach from there.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Let's move to (3, 6).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "spiral" or "snail shell" pattern. The path winds around itself, creating a series of loops and turns that gradually lead towards the goal.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a spiral pattern of empty spaces. The new maze will have a valid path from the player position to the goal, but it will not be identical to the original maze.

**New Maze:**

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:** (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 3)

- **Player position:** (5, 1)

- **Goal:** (3, 5)

This new maze maintains the spiral-like pattern of empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal. The path winds through the maze in a similar fashion to the original, but the specific layout of walls and empty spaces is different.
