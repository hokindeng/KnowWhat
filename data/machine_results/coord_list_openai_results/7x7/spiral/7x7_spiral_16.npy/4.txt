You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position to the goal position by moving through empty spaces. The player's current position is (0, 1), and the goal is at (5, 5).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (0, 1):

1. **Up**: (0, 1) -> (-1, 1) (out of bounds, not possible)
2. **Down**: (0, 1) -> (1, 1) (empty space, possible)
3. **Left**: (0, 1) -> (0, 0) (wall, not possible)
4. **Right**: (0, 1) -> (0, 2) (empty space, possible)

From (0, 1), we can move either down to (1, 1) or right to (0, 2). To make progress towards the goal, let's move to the right to (0, 2).

**Next move: (0, 2)**

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)

2. **Down**: (3, 5) -> (4, 5) (wall, not possible)
3. **Left**: (3, 5) -> (3, 4) (empty space, possible)
4. **Right**: (3, 5) -> (3, 6) (empty space, possible)

To continue making progress towards the goal, let's move right to (3, 6).

**Next move: (3, 6)**

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze. The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "spiral" or "snail shell" pattern, where the path winds around and eventually leads to the goal.

### (1) General Shape: Spiral

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size, with a spiral path from the player position to the goal. The original maze is 7 rows by 7 columns, so the new maze will have the same dimensions.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)
- **Empty**: (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2)
- **Player position**: (0, 6)
- **Goal**: (5, 5)

This new maze maintains the spiral shape of the path while ensuring it is not an identical copy of the original maze. The player can navigate from the starting position to the goal by following the spiral path through the empty spaces.
