You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position to the goal position by moving through empty spaces. The player's current position is (0, 1), and the goal is at (5, 5).

Let's start by examining the possible moves from the current position (0, 1):

1. **Up**: (0, 1) -> (-1, 1) (out of bounds, not possible)
2. **Down**: (0, 1) -> (1, 1) (empty space, possible)
3. **Left**: (0, 1) -> (0, 0) (wall, not possible)
4. **Right**: (0, 1) -> (0, 2) (empty space, possible)

From (0, 1), we can move either to (1, 1) or (0, 2). Let's choose to move to (1, 1) as it seems to be a step towards the goal.

The next move is to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up**: (1, 1) -> (0, 1) (empty space, possible)
2. **Down**: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) (empty space, possible)
3. **Left**: (1, 1) -> (1, 0) (wall, not possible)
4. **Right**: (1, 1) -> (1, 2) (wall, not possible)

From (1, 1), we can move to either (0, 1) or (2, 1). Moving to (2, 1) seems to be a step towards the goal.

The next move is to (2, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first analyze the original maze's empty spaces to determine the general shape they form.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "snake-like" path. The path winds through the maze, moving downwards and to the right, with some backtracking.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar zigzag path. We'll ensure that the path is not identical to the original but maintains the zigzag pattern.

#### New Maze Encoding

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
- **Empty**: (0, 2), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 6)
- **Player position**: (0, 2)
- **Goal**: (5, 6)

This new maze maintains a zigzag path from the player position to the goal, ensuring a similar shape to the original maze's path.
