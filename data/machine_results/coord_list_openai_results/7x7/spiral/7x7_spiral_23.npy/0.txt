You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (3, 5) to the goal position (6, 4) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's find a path step-by-step.

The current position is (3, 5). From here, the possible moves are:
- Up to (2, 5)
- Down to (4, 5)
- Left to (3, 3)

Since the goal is at (6, 4), moving down towards (4, 5) seems like a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal.

Let's move to (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current position is (4, 5). From here, the possible moves are:
- Up to (3, 5)
- Down to (5, 5)

Since the goal is at (6, 4), moving down towards (5, 5) seems like a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal.

Let's move to (5, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

- Left to (5, 1)

Since the goal is at (6, 4), moving down towards (6, 5) seems like a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal.

Let's move to (6, 5).

Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The current position is (6, 5). From here, the possible moves are:
- Up to (5, 5)
- Left to (6, 4)

Since the goal is at (6, 4), moving left to (6, 4) will reach the goal.

Let's move to (6, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "snake-like" path. This path winds through the maze, creating a series of turns and bends.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar zigzag path. We'll ensure that the path is not identical to the original but maintains the zigzag pattern.

**New Maze:**

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
- **Empty:** (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
- **Player position:** (3, 5)
- **Goal:** (6, 4)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a zigzag path, but the specific configuration of walls and empty spaces is different from the original maze. The player can still navigate from the starting position to the goal by following the zigzag path.
