You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces and avoiding walls. The player's current position is (4, 6), and the goal is at (0, 2).

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (4, 6):

1. **Up** to (3, 6) - This is an empty space.
2. **Down** to (5, 6) - This is a wall.
3. **Left** to (4, 5) - This is an empty space.
4. **Right** to (4, 7) - This is out of bounds.

The valid moves are up to (3, 6) and left to (4, 5). To move towards the goal, let's choose the move that seems to bring us closer to the goal. Moving left to (4, 5) seems to be a good choice as it keeps us in the path towards the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 5), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up** to (3, 5) - This is a wall.
2. **Down** to (5, 5) - This is a wall.
3. **Left** to (4, 4) - This is an empty space.
4. **Right** to (4, 6) - This is an empty space, but it would take us back to the previous position.

To continue progressing towards the goal, moving left to (4, 4) is a good choice as it keeps us on the path and moves us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

3. **Left** to (4, 3) - This is an empty space.
4. **Right** to (4, 5) - This is an empty space, but it would take us back to the previous position.

To continue progressing towards the goal, moving left to (4, 3) is a good choice as it keeps us on the path and moves us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (4, 3).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up** to (3, 2) - This is an empty space.
2. **Down** to (5, 2) - This is a wall.
3. **Left** to (4, 1) - This is a wall.
4. **Right** to (4, 3) - This is an empty space, but it would take us back to the previous position.

To continue progressing towards the goal, moving up to (3, 2) is a good choice as it keeps us on the path and moves us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up** to (2, 2) - This is an empty space.
2. **Down** to (4, 2) - This is an empty space, but it would take us back to the previous position.
3. **Left** to (3, 1) - This is a wall.
4. **Right** to (3, 3) - This is a wall.

To continue progressing towards the goal, moving up to (2, 2) is a good choice as it keeps us on the path and moves us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

3. **Left** to (2, 1) - This is a wall.
4. **Right** to (2, 3) - This is an empty space.

To continue progressing towards the goal, moving right to (2, 3) is a good choice as it keeps us on the path and moves us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up** to (1, 3) - This is a wall.
2. **Down** to (3, 3) - This is a wall.
3. **Left** to (2, 2) - This is an empty space, but it would take us back to the previous position.
4. **Right** to (2, 4) - This is an empty space.

To continue progressing towards the goal, moving right to (2, 4) is a good choice as it keeps us on the path and moves us closer to the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up** to (1, 4) - This is a wall.
2. **Down** to (3, 4) - This is a wall.
3. **Left** to (2, 3) - This is an empty space, but it would take us back to the previous position.
4. **Right** to (2, 5) - This is a wall.

Given the current options, the only valid move is to go back to the previous position, which is left to (2, 3). However, to make progress towards the goal, we need to explore other paths. Let's backtrack to (2, 3) and then consider moving up from there.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves again:

1. **Up** to (1, 3) - This is a wall.
2. **Down** to (3, 3) - This is a wall.
3. **Left** to (2, 2) - This is an empty space, and it would take us back to a previous position.
4. **Right** to (2, 4) - This is an empty space, but it would take us back to the previous position.

Since moving to (2, 4) didn't help us progress towards the goal, let's backtrack to (2, 2) and explore a different path from there.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves again:

1. **Up** to (1, 2) - This is a wall.
2. **Down** to (3, 2) - This is an empty space, but it would take us back to a previous position.
3. **Left** to (2, 1) - This is a wall.
4. **Right** to (2, 3) - This is an empty space, but it would take us back to a previous position.

Since the previous paths didn't lead us to the goal, let's consider a different approach. We need to find a way to move upwards towards the goal at (0, 2). 

From (2, 2), the only unexplored path that could potentially lead us closer to the goal is to move up to (1, 6) via (2, 6) and then try to find a way to move left towards the goal. 

Let's move to (2, 6) as a step towards exploring this new path.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 6).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address the task:

1. **Name of the General Shape**: The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "spiral" or "snail shell" pattern. The path starts at one point and spirals inward, with some dead ends, but generally follows a winding path.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape**:

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a spiral-like pattern of empty spaces. We'll ensure there's a valid path from the player position to the goal.

**New Maze Configuration:**

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
- **Empty**: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6)
- **Player Position**: (5, 6)
- **Goal**: (0, 6)

This new maze maintains a spiral-like pattern of empty spaces, starting from the bottom right and spiraling inward, with a valid path from the player position to the goal.
