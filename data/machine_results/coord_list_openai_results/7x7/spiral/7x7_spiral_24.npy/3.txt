You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (4, 6) to the goal at (0, 2) by moving through empty spaces. Let's find the next move.

The player's current position is (4, 6). From here, the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:

- Up to (3, 6)
- Left to (4, 5)

Since we need to move towards the goal at (0, 2), let's choose the move that brings us closer to the goal. Moving up to (3, 6) seems like a good choice because it takes us closer to the top row where the goal is located.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.The player's current position is (3, 6). From here, the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:

- Down to (4, 6)
- Left to (3, 2)

Since we want to move towards the goal at (0, 2), moving left to (3, 2) is a good choice because it brings us closer to the goal's column.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "U" shape. The path starts at the bottom right, goes up along the right side, then moves left across the top, and finally descends slightly to reach the goal.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces forming a similar "U" shape:

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:** (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)

- **Player position:** (4, 6)

- **Goal:** (0, 6)

This new maze maintains the "U" shape of the empty spaces, starting from the bottom right, moving up along the right side, then left across the top, and finally reaching the goal.
