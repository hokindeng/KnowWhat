You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player position at (5, 3) to the goal at (1, 3) using only the empty spaces. Let's find a path step-by-step.

Starting at (5, 3), we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are:

- Up to (4, 3) - but this is a wall.
- Down to (6, 3) - but this is a wall.
- Left to (5, 2) - this is an empty space.
- Right to (5, 4) - this is an empty space.

Let's move right to (5, 4).

Next move: (5, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5)

- Left to (5, 3) - this is an empty space.
- Right to (5, 5) - this is an empty space.

Let's move right to (5, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "spiral" or "snail shell" pattern. The path winds around itself, creating a spiral-like corridor.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a spiral-like pattern of empty spaces. The new maze will have a different configuration but maintain the spiral shape.

**New Maze:**

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:** (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)

- **Player position:** (5, 1)

- **Goal:** (1, 5)

This new maze maintains a spiral-like pattern of empty spaces, providing a valid path from the player position to the goal.
