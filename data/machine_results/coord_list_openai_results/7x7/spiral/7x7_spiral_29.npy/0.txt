You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (5, 3) to the goal at (1, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's find the path step-by-step.

The player's current position is (5, 3). From here, the possible moves are:
- Up to (4, 3)
- Down to (6, 3) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (5, 2)
- Right to (5, 4)

Since (4, 3) is a wall, and (6, 3) is out of bounds, the viable moves are:
- Left to (5, 2)
- Right to (5, 4)

Let's move right to (5, 4).

The next move is to (5, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 4), the possible moves are:
- Up to (4, 4) (but this is a wall)
- Down to (6, 4) (but this is a wall)
- Left to (5, 3)
- Right to (5, 5)

Since (4, 4) and (6, 4) are walls, the viable moves are:
- Left to (5, 3)
- Right to (5, 5)

Let's move right to (5, 5).

The next move is to (5, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- Right to (5, 6) (but this is a wall)

Since (4, 5), (6, 5), and (5, 6) are walls, the only viable move is:
- Left to (5, 4)

Let's move left to (5, 4).

The next move is to (5, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "spiral" or "snail shell" pattern. This pattern involves a winding path that loops around itself, creating a series of turns and corridors that gradually lead from the outer part of the maze toward the center.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a spiral pattern. The new maze will have a different configuration of walls and empty spaces but will maintain the spiral-like path from the player position to the goal.

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4)

- **Empty:** (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)

- **Player position:** (5, 3)

- **Goal:** (1, 3)

This new maze maintains the spiral-like path, allowing the player to navigate from the starting position to the goal while following a winding route.
