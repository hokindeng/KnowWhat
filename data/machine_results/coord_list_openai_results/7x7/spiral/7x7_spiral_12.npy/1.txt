You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces. The player's current position is (3, 4), and the goal is at (3, 6).

Let's examine the possible moves from the current position (3, 4):

1. **Up** to (2, 4) - This is an empty space.
2. **Down** to (4, 4) - This is an empty space.
3. **Left** to (3, 3) - This is a wall.
4. **Right** to (3, 5) - This is a wall.

From (3, 4), the valid moves are to (2, 4) or (4, 4). To get closer to the goal at (3, 6), let's move to (4, 4).

The next move is to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Up** to (3, 4) - This is an empty space.
2. **Down** to (5, 4) - This is a wall.
3. **Left** to (4, 3) - This is an empty space.
4. **Right** to (4, 5) - This is a wall.

To progress towards the goal at (3, 6), we should move to (4, 3), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the path leading to the goal.

The next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

2. **Down** to (5, 3) - This is a wall.
3. **Left** to (4, 2) - This is an empty space.
4. **Right** to (4, 4) - This is an empty space.

To continue towards the goal at (3, 6), we should move to (4, 4), which is an empty space and allows us to explore further paths towards the goal.

The next move is to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

2. **Down** to (3, 4) - This is an empty space.
3. **Left** to (2, 3) - This is a wall.

The only valid move from (2, 4) is to move down to (3, 4), which is an empty space.

The next move is to (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the oversight in my previous responses. Let's reevaluate the situation from the current position (3, 4) to find a path to the goal at (3, 6).

From (3, 4), let's consider the possible moves:

1. **Up** to (2, 4) - This is an empty space.
2. **Down** to (4, 4) - This is an empty space.
3. **Left** to (3, 3) - This is a wall.
4. **Right** to (3, 5) - This is a wall.

Since moving right to (3, 5) is not possible, let's try a different approach. We need to find a path that eventually leads to (3, 6). Let's move down to (4, 4) and then explore further from there.

The next move is to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

3. **Left** to (0, 3) - This is an empty space.
4. **Right** to (0, 5) - This is an empty space.

To make progress towards the goal at (3, 6), let's move right to (0, 5), which is an empty space. This will allow us to continue moving towards the goal.

The next move is to (0, 5).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

Upon examining the original maze, the empty spaces form a shape that resembles a **"U"**. The path starts at the top, goes down one side, and then back up the other side, with a connection at the bottom.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a "U" shape formed by the empty spaces. The new maze will have a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G) and will not be an identical copy of the original maze.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
- **Empty**: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
- **Player position**: (0, 2)
- **Goal**: (5, 4)

This new maze maintains the "U" shape of the empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal.
