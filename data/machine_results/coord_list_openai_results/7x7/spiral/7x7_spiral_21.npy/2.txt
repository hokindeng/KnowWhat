You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (0, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces and avoiding walls. The player's current position is (4, 0), and the goal is at (0, 0).

Let's explore the possible moves from the current position (4, 0):

1. **Up** to (3, 0) - This is an empty space.
2. **Down** to (5, 0) - This is a wall.
3. **Left** to (4, -1) - This is out of bounds.
4. **Right** to (4, 1) - This is an empty space.

From (4, 0), the valid moves are to (3, 0) and (4, 1). To move towards the goal, let's choose the move that brings us closer to (0, 0). Moving to (3, 0) seems like a good choice because it moves us up towards the goal.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (0, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 0), let's explore the possible moves:

1. **Up** to (2, 0) - This is an empty space.
2. **Down** to (4, 0) - This is an empty space, but we just came from there.
3. **Left** to (3, -1) - This is out of bounds.
4. **Right** to (3, 1) - This is a wall.

The valid move that brings us closer to the goal is to move **up** to (2, 0).

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (0, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 0), let's explore the possible moves:

1. **Up** to (1, 0) - This is an empty space.
2. **Down** to (3, 0) - This is an empty space, but we just came from there.
3. **Left** to (2, -1) - This is out of bounds.
4. **Right** to (2, 1) - This is a wall.

The valid move that brings us closer to the goal is to move **up** to (1, 0).

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (0, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 0), let's explore the possible moves:

1. **Up** to (0, 0) - This is the goal position.
2. **Down** to (2, 0) - This is an empty space, but we just came from there.
3. **Left** to (1, -1) - This is out of bounds.
4. **Right** to (1, 1) - This is a wall.

The move that takes us directly to the goal is to move **up** to (0, 0).

Therefore, the next move is to (0, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape:**

The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "spiral" or "snail shell" pattern. The path starts at the outer edge and spirals inward, allowing movement towards the center.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar spiral pattern of empty spaces. The new maze will have a different configuration of walls and empty spaces but will maintain the spiral shape.

**New Maze:**

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1)
- **Empty:** (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
- **Player position:** (2, 1)
- **Goal:** (4, 3)

This new maze maintains the spiral shape, starting from the player position at (2, 1) and spiraling inward to the goal at (4, 3). The path is different from the original maze but follows a similar pattern.
