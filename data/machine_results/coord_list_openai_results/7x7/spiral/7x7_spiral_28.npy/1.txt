You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (1, 6) to the goal at (4, 2) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's find a path step-by-step.

Starting at (1, 6), the possible moves are:
- Up to (0, 6)
- Left to (1, 5) (but this is a wall, so it's not possible)

The only valid move is to go up to (0, 6).

So, the next move is to (0, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)

Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position at (0, 6), the possible moves are:
- Down to (1, 6)
- Left to (0, 5)

Since we want to make progress towards the goal at (4, 2), let's move left to (0, 5).

The next move is to (0, 5).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position at (2, 3), the possible moves are:
- Left to (2, 2)
- Right to (2, 4)

To continue making progress towards the goal at (4, 2), let's move right to (2, 4).

The next move is to (2, 4).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position at (2, 4), the possible moves are:
- Left to (2, 3)
- Up to (1, 4) (but this is a wall, so it's not possible)

Since moving left to (2, 3) would take us back, let's consider the path forward. We need to find a way to reach the goal at (4, 2). Let's backtrack to (2, 3) and then explore other paths.

The next move is to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position at (2, 3), the possible moves are:
- Left to (2, 2)
- Right to (2, 4)

Since moving right to (2, 4) didn't help us progress towards the goal, let's try a different path. We can move left to (2, 2) and then explore further options.

The next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position at (2, 2), the possible moves are:
- Up to (1, 2)
- Right to (2, 3)

Since we've already explored the path to the right, let's try moving up to (1, 2) and then explore further options from there.

The next move is to (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Since we've already explored the path down to (2, 2), let's try moving up to (0, 2) and then explore further options from there.

The next move is to (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's try a different approach to reach the goal at (4, 2).

From the current position at (0, 2), the possible moves are:
- Right to (0, 3)
- Down to (1, 2)

Since we've already explored the path down to (1, 2) and it didn't lead us to the goal, let's move right to (0, 3) and explore further options from there.

The next move is to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position at (0, 3), the possible moves are:
- Right to (0, 4)
- Left to (0, 2)

Since moving left to (0, 2) would take us back, let's move right to (0, 4) and explore further options from there.

The next move is to (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Since moving left to (0, 3) would take us back, let's move right to (0, 5) and explore further options from there.

The next move is to (0, 5).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors) in the original maze. The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "spiral" or "snail shell" pattern, where the path winds around itself.

Now, let's create a new maze of the same size with empty spaces that form a similar spiral shape. The new maze will have a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G) and will not be an identical copy of the original maze.

### New Maze

**Walls:**
- (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)
- (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6)
- (2, 0), (2, 6)
- (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
- (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 6)
- (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
- (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

**Empty:**
- (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)
- (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)
- (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
- (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)

**Player position:** (1, 2)

**Goal:** (4, 5)

This new maze maintains a spiral-like pattern for the empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal.
