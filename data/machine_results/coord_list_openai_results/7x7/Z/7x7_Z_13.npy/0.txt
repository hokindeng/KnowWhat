You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (2, 5) to the goal position (4, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position:

Current position: (2, 5)

Possible moves from (2, 5) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (2, 4) is an empty space and can be moved to.

Let's move to (2, 4).

Next move: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal at (4, 3):

Current position: (2, 4)

Possible moves from (2, 4) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (2, 3) is an empty space and can be moved to.
- (3, 4) is an empty space and can be moved to.

To get closer to the goal (4, 3), moving to (3, 4) seems like a good choice.

Next move: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves to reach the goal at (4, 3):

Current position: (3, 4)

Possible moves from (3, 4) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (2, 3) is an empty space and can be moved to.

However, to get closer to the goal (4, 3), we can move diagonally to (4, 3), which is the goal position.

Next move: (4, 3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "T" or "cross" shape. This is because the empty spaces create a vertical path with a horizontal branch, similar to the letter "T".

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a "T" shape formed by the empty spaces. The new maze will have a different configuration of walls and empty spaces but will maintain the "T" shape.

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:** (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2)

- **Player position:** (6, 2)

- **Goal:** (3, 4)

This new maze maintains the "T" shape with a vertical path from (6, 2) to (3, 2) and a horizontal branch from (3, 2) to (3, 4), where the goal is located.
