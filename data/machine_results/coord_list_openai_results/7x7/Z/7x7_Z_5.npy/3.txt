You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (5, 5) to the goal at (1, 5) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's find a path step-by-step.

The current position is (5, 5). From here, we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are:
- Up to (4, 5) (but it's a wall)
- Down to (6, 5) (but it's a wall)
- Left to (5, 4) (empty space)
- Right to (5, 6) (empty space)
- Diagonally to (4, 4) (but it's a wall)
- Diagonally to (4, 6) (but it's a wall)
- Diagonally to (6, 4) (but it's a wall)
- Diagonally to (6, 6) (but it's a wall)

The only valid moves are to (5, 4) or (5, 6). To move towards the goal, let's choose (5, 6).

The next move is to (5, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 6), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 5). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

- Up to (4, 6) (but it's a wall)
- Down to (6, 6) (but it's a wall)
- Left to (5, 5) (empty space)
- Right to (5, 7) (out of bounds, assuming the grid ends at (6, 6))
- Diagonally to (4, 5) (but it's a wall)
- Diagonally to (4, 7) (out of bounds)
- Diagonally to (6, 5) (but it's a wall)
- Diagonally to (6, 7) (out of bounds)

The only valid move is to (5, 5), which is backtracking. However, this allows us to explore other paths. Let's move to (5, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern involves a series of connected diagonal and straight-line segments that create a path through the maze.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape
Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar "zigzag" pattern for the empty spaces. We'll ensure that there is a valid path from the player position to the goal.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:** (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 4)

- **Player position:** (5, 4)

- **Goal:** (1, 6)

This new maze maintains the "zigzag" pattern of empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal while differing from the original maze configuration.
