You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 5)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position to the goal position, moving only through empty spaces and avoiding walls. The player is currently at (6, 5), and the goal is at (0, 3).

Let's examine the possible moves from the current position (6, 5):

1. Up to (5, 5) - Wall
2. Down to (7, 5) - Out of bounds
3. Left to (6, 4) - Empty
4. Right to (6, 6) - Empty
5. Diagonal up-left to (5, 4) - Wall
6. Diagonal up-right to (5, 6) - Wall
7. Diagonal down-left to (7, 4) - Out of bounds
8. Diagonal down-right to (7, 6) - Out of bounds

The valid moves are to (6, 4) and (6, 6). To move towards the goal at (0, 3), let's choose the move to (6, 4).

The next move is to (6, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first analyze the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "snake-like" path. This path winds through the maze, avoiding walls, and provides a route from the starting position to the goal.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size, with a similar "zigzag" or "snake-like" path. The maze will have a different configuration of walls and empty spaces but will maintain the same general shape for the path.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls:** (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
- **Empty:** (0, 0), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
- **Player position:** (6, 0)
- **Goal:** (0, 6)

This new maze maintains a "zigzag" path from the player position at (6, 0) to the goal at (0, 6), while differing from the original maze's configuration.
