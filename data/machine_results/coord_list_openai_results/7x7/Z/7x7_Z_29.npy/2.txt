You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position at (6, 0) to the goal position at (3, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position:

Current position: (6, 0)

Possible moves from (6, 0) to adjacent empty spaces:
- Move to (5, 1)

Let's make the move to (5, 1).

Next move: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (5, 1), let's evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

Current position: (5, 1)

Possible moves from (5, 1) to adjacent empty spaces:
- Move to (6, 1)
- Move to (4, 2)

To progress towards the goal at (3, 3), let's move to (4, 2).

Next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (4, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

Current position: (4, 2)

Possible moves from (4, 2) to adjacent empty spaces:
- Move to (3, 2)

Moving to (3, 2) will bring us closer to the goal at (3, 3).

Next move: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

Current position: (3, 2)

Possible moves from (3, 2) to adjacent empty spaces:
- Move to (3, 1)
- Move to (3, 3) (goal position)

Since (3, 3) is the goal position, let's move there to reach the goal.

Next move: (3, 3)

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path moves in a zigzag manner from the bottom left to the top right, with turns at each row.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" shape:

**New Maze:**

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:** (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)

- **Player position:** (6, 0)

- **Goal:** (3, 3)

This new maze maintains the zigzag pattern of the empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal.
