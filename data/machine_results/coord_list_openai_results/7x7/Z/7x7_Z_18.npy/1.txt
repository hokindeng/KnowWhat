You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (2, 1) to the goal position (6, 3) by moving through the empty spaces. We can move in any of the eight possible directions (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) as long as the destination is an empty space.

Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position (2, 1):

1. **Right to (2, 2)**: This is an empty space and a valid move.
2. **Down to (3, 1)**: This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
3. **Down-right to (3, 2)**: This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
4. **Down-left to (3, 0)**: This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
5. **Left to (2, 0)**: This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
6. **Up-left to (1, 0)**: This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
7. **Up to (1, 1)**: This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
8. **Up-right to (1, 2)**: This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.

The only valid move from (2, 1) is to move right to (2, 2).

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 2), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Right to (2, 3)**: This is an empty space and a valid move.
2. **Down to (3, 2)**: This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
3. **Down-right to (3, 3)**: This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
4. **Down-left to (3, 1)**: This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
5. **Left to (2, 1)**: This is an empty space and a valid move, but it takes us back to the previous position.
6. **Up-left to (1, 1)**: This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
7. **Up to (1, 2)**: This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.
8. **Up-right to (1, 3)**: This is a wall, so it's not a valid move.

The best move to progress towards the goal is to move right to (2, 3).

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first analyze the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The path moves in a zigzag manner from the starting position to the goal, with turns at various points.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar zigzag pattern for the empty spaces. We'll ensure that there is a valid path from the player position to the goal.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
- **Empty**: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
- **Player position**: (2, 1)
- **Goal**: (6, 5)

This new maze maintains the zigzag pattern of the empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal. The path moves right, down, left, and then down again, similar to the original maze's zigzag pattern.
