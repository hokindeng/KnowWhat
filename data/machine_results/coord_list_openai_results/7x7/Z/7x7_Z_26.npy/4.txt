You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (0, 4) to the goal position (3, 4) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. From (0, 4), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (0, 3) to the left
   - (0, 5) to the right
   - (1, 4) downward

Since we want to move towards the goal at (3, 4), moving downward to (1, 4) seems like a good choice.

Therefore, the next move is to (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (1, 4), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 4). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (1, 4), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (0, 4) upward
   - (2, 3) diagonally down-left

Since we want to move closer to the goal at (3, 4), moving diagonally down-left to (2, 3) is a good choice.

Therefore, the next move is to (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 3), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 4). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (2, 3), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (3, 3) downward

Moving downward to (3, 3) will bring us closer to the goal at (3, 4).

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 5)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 3), we need to move to the goal at (3, 4). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (3, 3), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (3, 2) to the left
   - (3, 4) to the right (which is the goal)

Since (3, 4) is the goal position, we should move directly to it.

Therefore, the next move is to (3, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path we took moved diagonally and horizontally in a zigzag manner through the maze.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with empty spaces forming a similar "zigzag" pattern. The maze includes a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G):

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty**: (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 5)

- **Player position**: (0, 3)

- **Goal**: (3, 4)

This new maze maintains the zigzag pattern of empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal.
