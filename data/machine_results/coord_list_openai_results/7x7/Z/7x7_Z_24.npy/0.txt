You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position at (0, 3) to the goal position at (0, 1) by moving through the empty spaces. The player can move to any adjacent empty space, including diagonals.

Here's the current situation:
- Player position: (0, 3)
- Goal position: (0, 1)

The empty spaces are: (0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3).

From (0, 3), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- (0, 2)

Let's move to (0, 2) as the next step.

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (0, 2), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 1). The empty spaces are: (0, 0), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3).

From (0, 2), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- (0, 3)
- (1, 2)

However, to move closer to the goal at (0, 1), we should move to (0, 3) and then to (0, 1) in subsequent steps.

Next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the oversight. Let's correct the path to reach the goal at (0, 1) from the current position at (0, 3).

From (0, 3), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- (0, 2)

However, to move towards the goal at (0, 1), we should consider moving to (0, 2) and then to (0, 1).

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (0, 2), we need to move towards the goal at (0, 1). The empty spaces are: (0, 0), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3).

From (0, 2), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- (0, 3)

However, to move towards the goal at (0, 1), we should move diagonally to (1, 2) and then to (2, 1), and finally to (0, 1).

Next move: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position at (1, 2), we need to move towards the goal at (0, 1). The empty spaces are: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3).

From (1, 2), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- (0, 2)
- (2, 1)

To move closer to the goal at (0, 1), let's move to (0, 2).

Next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's focus on reaching the goal at (0, 1) from the current position at (0, 2).

From (0, 2), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
- (0, 3)
- (1, 2)

However, to move directly towards the goal at (0, 1), we should move to (0, 1).

Next move: (0, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first analyze the original maze's empty spaces to determine the general shape they form.

### (1) General Shape of the Empty Spaces

The empty spaces in the original maze are:
- (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3)
- (1, 2)
- (2, 1)
- (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

These coordinates form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern, moving diagonally downwards and to the right.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern for the empty spaces. We'll ensure there's a valid path from a new player position to a new goal position.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls:** (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:** (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

- **Player position:** (3, 3)

- **Goal:** (0, 0)

This new maze maintains the "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern of empty spaces, providing a valid path from the player position at (3, 3) to the goal at (0, 0).
