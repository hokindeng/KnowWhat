You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (3, 4) to the goal position (0, 5) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. From (3, 4), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (3, 3)
   - (3, 5)

Since we need to move towards the goal at (0, 5), moving to (3, 5) seems like a more direct path. Therefore, the next move should be to (3, 5).

Next move: (3, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 5), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 5). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (3, 5), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (2, 4)
   - (3, 4)
   - (3, 6)

To move closer to the goal at (0, 5), we should move to (2, 4), which is a step upwards and brings us closer to the goal row.

Next move: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (2, 4), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 5). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (2, 4), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (3, 3)
   - (3, 4)
   - (3, 5)

Since none of these moves directly bring us closer to the goal, we need to backtrack slightly to find a path that leads upwards. Moving back to (3, 5) will allow us to explore other options to reach the goal.

Next move: (3, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 5), we need to find a path that leads us closer to the goal at (0, 5). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (3, 5), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (2, 4)
   - (3, 4)
   - (3, 6)

Since moving to (2, 4) did not help us previously, let's try moving to (3, 6) to explore a different path.

Next move: (3, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (3, 6), we need to find a path that leads us closer to the goal at (0, 5). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (3, 6), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (3, 5)

Since moving to (3, 5) will not help us progress towards the goal, let's reconsider our approach. We need to find a way to move upwards towards the goal. Let's backtrack to (3, 5) and then explore moving to (2, 4) again, as it might lead us to a path we haven't fully explored.

Next move: (3, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let's reassess the situation to find a path to the goal at (0, 5). From the current position (3, 5), we need to explore a path that allows us to move upwards towards the goal. 

1. From (3, 5), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (2, 4)
   - (3, 4)
   - (3, 6)

Since moving to (2, 4) previously did not lead us to a new path, let's try moving to (3, 4) to explore if it opens up a new route.

Next move: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 4), we need to find a path that leads us closer to the goal at (0, 5). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (3, 4), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (2, 4)
   - (3, 3)
   - (3, 5)

Since moving to (2, 4) and (3, 5) has not led us to a successful path, let's try moving to (3, 3) to explore a different route.

Next move: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 3), we need to find a path that leads us closer to the goal at (0, 5). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (3, 3), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (3, 4)

Since moving to (3, 4) is the only available option, let's move there and reassess our path from that position.

Next move: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's try a different approach to find a path to the goal at (0, 5). From the current position (3, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (3, 4), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (3, 3)
   - (3, 5)
   - (2, 4)

Since moving to (3, 3) and (3, 5) has not led us to a successful path, let's try moving to (2, 4) again and explore if it opens up a new route.

Next move: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 4), we need to find a path that leads us closer to the goal at (0, 5). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (2, 4), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (3, 3)
   - (3, 4)

Since moving to (3, 3) and (3, 4) has not led us to a successful path, let's try a different approach. We need to find a way to move upwards towards the goal. Let's move to (1, 5), which is a new path we haven't explored yet.

Next move: (1, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 5), we are now very close to the goal at (0, 5). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. From (1, 5), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (0, 4)
   - (0, 6)

To reach the goal, we can move directly upwards to (0, 5).

Next move: (0, 5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze resembles a "zigzag" pattern. The path we navigated through the maze involved moving in a zigzag manner to reach the goal.

(2) Here is a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" shape. The maze is encoded using the same format as the original:

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty**: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4)

- **Player position**: (4, 4)

- **Goal**: (0, 3)

This new maze maintains the zigzag pattern of empty spaces, providing a valid path from the player position to the goal.
