You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (3, 4) to the goal position (0, 5) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. From (3, 4), the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces are:
   - (3, 3)
   - (3, 5)

2. Moving to (3, 5) brings us closer to the goal (0, 5).

Let's move to (3, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 5), let's evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

1. (3, 4) - This would take us back to the previous position.
2. (3, 6) - This is a valid move and brings us closer to the goal vertically.
3. (2, 4) - This is a valid move and brings us closer to the goal horizontally.

To make progress towards the goal (0, 5), let's move to (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

1. (3, 3) - This is a valid move but takes us away from the goal.
2. (3, 4) - This would take us back to a previous position.
3. (3, 5) - This would take us back to a previous position.

Since none of the adjacent empty spaces bring us closer to the goal, let's reconsider our path. We need to move towards the goal (0, 5). The best option is to move back to (3, 5) and then explore other paths from there.

Let's move to (3, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 5), let's evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

1. (3, 4) - This would take us back to a previous position.
2. (3, 6) - This is a valid move and brings us closer to the goal vertically.
3. (2, 4) - This would take us back to a previous position.

To make progress towards the goal (0, 5), let's move to (3, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 6), let's evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

1. (3, 5) - This would take us back to a previous position.

It seems I made an error in my previous analysis. Let's reconsider the path. From (3, 6), there are no new empty spaces to move to that bring us closer to the goal. We need to backtrack to explore other paths.

Let's move back to (3, 5) and then explore other options from there.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 5), let's carefully evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

1. (3, 4) - This would take us back to a previous position.
2. (3, 6) - This would take us back to a previous position.
3. (2, 4) - This would take us back to a previous position.

It seems we need to explore a different path. Let's try moving to (3, 3) to explore a new direction.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern is characterized by a series of connected diagonal and horizontal/vertical moves that create a zigzagging path through the maze.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze with the same zigzag pattern. The original maze seems to be a 7x7 grid, so we'll maintain that size. Here's the new maze:

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
- **Empty:** (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 4), (5, 2), (6, 1)
- **Player position:** (6, 1)
- **Goal:** (0, 4)

This new maze maintains the zigzag pattern of empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal.
