You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (3, 4) to the goal position (0, 5) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position:

Current position: (3, 4)

Possible moves from (3, 4) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (3, 3)
- (3, 5)

Since we need to move towards the goal at (0, 5), moving to (3, 5) seems like a more direct path. Therefore, the next move should be to (3, 5).

Next move: (3, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 5), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 5). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

Current position: (3, 5)

Possible moves from (3, 5) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (3, 4)
- (3, 6)

To make progress towards the goal, we should consider moving upwards. However, we need to find a path that eventually leads us to (0, 5). Let's move to (3, 6) as it is a new position and might open up further paths.

Next move: (3, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 6), we need to find a path that leads us closer to the goal at (0, 5). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

Current position: (3, 6)

Possible moves from (3, 6) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (3, 5)

Since moving to (3, 5) is the only available move, we should backtrack to that position and then explore other options from there.

Next move: (3, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 5), we need to find a path that leads us closer to the goal at (0, 5). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

Current position: (3, 5)

Possible moves from (3, 5) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (3, 4)

Since moving to (3, 4) is the only available move that we haven't explored in this direction, let's move there and see if it opens up new paths.

Next move: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 4), we need to find a path that leads us closer to the goal at (0, 5). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

Current position: (3, 4)

Possible moves from (3, 4) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (3, 3)
- (3, 5)

Since we've already explored (3, 5) and it didn't lead us closer to the goal, let's try moving to (3, 3) to explore a new path.

Next move: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 3), we need to find a path that leads us closer to the goal at (0, 5). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

Current position: (3, 3)

Possible moves from (3, 3) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (3, 4)

Since moving to (3, 4) is the only available move, we should return to that position and then explore other options from there.

Next move: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.It seems we've been moving in circles. Let's reassess the situation to find a path to the goal at (0, 5).

From the current position (3, 4), let's consider the possible moves:

Current position: (3, 4)

Possible moves from (3, 4) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (3, 3)
- (3, 5)

Since moving to (3, 5) previously didn't lead us to a new path, let's consider a different approach. We need to find a way to move upwards towards the goal. Let's try moving to (2, 4), which is an upward move and might open up new paths.

Next move: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 4), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 5). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

Current position: (2, 4)

Possible moves from (2, 4) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (3, 4)

Since moving to (3, 4) would take us back to a previously visited position, let's consider the possibility of moving diagonally to (1, 5), which is an empty space and brings us closer to the goal.

Next move: (1, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (1, 5), we are very close to the goal at (0, 5). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

Current position: (1, 5)

Possible moves from (1, 5) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (0, 5)

Moving to (0, 5) will take us directly to the goal.

Next move: (0, 5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **General Shape of the Empty Spaces (Corridors):** The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern involves a series of connected segments that move diagonally or in a step-like fashion.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape:**

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern for the empty spaces. The new maze will have a valid path from the player position to the goal.

**New Maze:**

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:** (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)

- **Player position:** (6, 1)

- **Goal:** (0, 3)

This new maze maintains the "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern of empty spaces, providing a valid path from the player position to the goal.
