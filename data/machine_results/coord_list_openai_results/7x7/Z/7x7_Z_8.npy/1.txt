You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the player's current position at (4, 0) to the goal at (2, 2) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's analyze the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (4, 0)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Right to (4, 1) [Empty]
   - Up-Right to (3, 1) [Empty]

Since we need to move towards the goal at (2, 2), moving to (3, 1) seems like a good choice as it brings us closer to the goal.

**Next Move**: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 1), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 2). Let's evaluate the possible moves:

1. **Current Position**: (3, 1)
2. **Possible Moves**:
   - Up to (2, 1) [Wall]
   - Up-Right to (2, 2) [Goal]
   - Right to (3, 2) [Wall]
   - Down-Right to (4, 2) [Empty]
   - Down to (4, 1) [Empty]
   - Down-Left to (4, 0) [Empty]

The best move is to go directly to the goal at (2, 2).

**Next Move**: (2, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. **Name of the General Shape**: The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern starts at the bottom left, moves up diagonally to the right, then shifts horizontally, and finally moves up again.

2. **New Maze with the Same Shape**:

Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern for the empty spaces. We'll ensure there's a valid path from the player position to the goal.

- **Walls**: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
- **Empty**: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
- **Player Position**: (4, 1)
- **Goal**: (2, 3)

This new maze maintains the "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern of empty spaces, providing a valid path from the player position to the goal.
