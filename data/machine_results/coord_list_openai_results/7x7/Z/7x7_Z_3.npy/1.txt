You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to navigate from the current player position (5, 1) to the goal position (1, 0) by moving through the empty spaces. Let's find a path step-by-step.

The current player position is (5, 1). From here, we can move to any adjacent empty space. The possible moves are:

- Up to (4, 1)
- Right to (5, 2)

Let's move up to (4, 1) as it seems to be a step towards the goal.

The next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current player position (4, 1), we need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 0). The possible moves from (4, 1) are:

- Down to (5, 1) (but we just came from there)
- Right to (5, 2) (but that doesn't bring us closer to the goal)
- Up to (3, 2)

Let's move up to (3, 2) as it brings us closer to the goal.

The next move is to (3, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze. The empty spaces form a path that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern, moving diagonally and then straight, which is a common pattern in mazes.

Now, let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with empty spaces that form a similar "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. The new maze will have a valid path from the player position (P) to the goal (G) and will not be an identical copy of the original maze.

### New Maze

**Walls:**
- (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)
- (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6)
- (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6)
- (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6)
- (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
- (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
- (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

**Empty:**
- (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)
- (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
- (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)
- (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
- (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)

**Player position:**
- (5, 0)

**Goal:**
- (1, 4)

This new maze maintains a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern for the empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal.
