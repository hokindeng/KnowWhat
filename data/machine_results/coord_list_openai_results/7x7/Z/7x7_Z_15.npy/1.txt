You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.To solve the maze, we need to find a path from the player's current position at (4, 2) to the goal at (5, 4), moving only through empty spaces and avoiding walls. Let's analyze the possible moves from the current position:

Current position: (4, 2)

Possible moves from (4, 2) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (3, 3) is an empty space and can be reached by moving diagonally up-right.
- (5, 1) is an empty space and can be reached by moving diagonally down-left.

Let's choose to move to (3, 3) as it seems to be a step towards the goal.

Next move: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (3, 3), let's evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

Current position: (3, 3)

Possible moves from (3, 3) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (2, 4) is an empty space and can be reached by moving diagonally up-right.
- (4, 2) is an empty space and can be reached by moving down-left.

Let's move to (2, 4) as it brings us closer to the goal.

Next move: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From the current position (2, 4), let's evaluate the possible moves to adjacent empty spaces:

Current position: (2, 4)

Possible moves from (2, 4) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (3, 3) is an empty space and can be reached by moving down-left.

Let's move to (3, 3) to continue progressing towards the goal.

Next move: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for the oversight. Let's reevaluate the situation from the current position (3, 3) and find a path towards the goal at (5, 4).

Current position: (3, 3)

Possible moves from (3, 3) to adjacent empty spaces:
- (2, 4) is an empty space and can be reached by moving diagonally up-right.
- (4, 2) is an empty space and can be reached by moving down-left.

Since moving to (2, 4) previously did not lead us closer to the goal, let's try moving to (4, 2) instead.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

To address your request, let's first identify the general shape formed by the empty spaces in the original maze.

### (1) General Shape
The empty spaces in the original maze form a shape that resembles a "zigzag" or "staircase" pattern. This pattern is characterized by a series of connected diagonal and horizontal/vertical paths that create a zigzagging corridor through the maze.

### (2) New Maze with the Same Shape
Let's create a new maze of the same size (7x7 grid) with a similar zigzag pattern of empty spaces. The new maze will have a valid path from the player position to the goal position, but it will not be an identical copy of the original maze.

#### New Maze Configuration

- **Walls:** (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- **Empty:** (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 2)

- **Player position:** (0, 1)

- **Goal:** (6, 2)

This new maze maintains the zigzag pattern of empty spaces, providing a path from the player position to the goal. The path can be navigated as follows: (0, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 1) → (3, 3) → (4, 2) → (5, 3) → (6, 2).
