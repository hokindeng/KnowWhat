You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 3), (6, 3)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at (3, 6)
2. The goal (G) is at (5, 4)
3. There is a path through the empty spaces that connects these positions

Looking at the empty spaces around the current position (3, 6), I can move to:
- (3, 5) - moving up

Since we need to reach (5, 4) and we're currently at (3, 6), we need to move both up and to the right. The best first move would be to move up to position (3, 5).

I choose to move to: (3, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 3), (6, 3)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 5), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (5, 4).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 5), I can move to:
- (3, 4) - moving up
- (4, 5) - moving right

Since the goal is at (5, 4), which is to the right and slightly up from my current position, moving to (4, 5) would bring me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (4, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), I need to reach the goal at (5, 4).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 5), I can move to:
- (4, 3) - moving up
- (5, 4) - moving diagonally up-right

Since (5, 4) is the goal position and it's directly accessible from my current position through a diagonal move, this is clearly the best choice.

I choose to move to: (5, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "7" shape (or "reversed L" shape). The vertical part of the 7 runs from (3, 6) to (3, 3), and the horizontal part extends from (3, 3) to (6, 3), with a few additional spaces to allow reaching the goal at (5, 4).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) where the empty spaces form a "7" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (6, 4)

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the 7 is still at column 3
- The horizontal part is still at row 3
- I've moved the goal to (6, 4) and adjusted the empty spaces slightly to maintain the "7" shape while ensuring a valid path exists
- The overall dimensions and basic structure remain the same, but it's not identical to the original maze
