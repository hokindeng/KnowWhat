You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Looking at the given coordinates:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 6)
2. The goal is at (6, 6)
3. I can move to any adjacent empty space, including diagonals
4. Looking at the empty spaces near my current position (2, 6), I can see:
   - (1, 6) above me
   - (3, 6) below me

Since I need to eventually reach (6, 6), moving downward towards the goal would be the better choice. Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 6).

My next move: (3, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 6), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 6).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 6):
- (2, 6) above me (but that's where I came from)
- (4, 6) below me

Since I need to move towards (6, 6) and (4, 6) is available and moves me closer to the goal, I'll move to that position.

My next move: (4, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 6), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 6).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 6):
- (3, 6) above me (but that's where I came from)
- (5, 6) below me

Since I need to move towards (6, 6) and (5, 6) is available and moves me closer to the goal, I'll move to that position.

My next move: (5, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 6), I need to make my final move to reach the goal at (6, 6).

Looking at my current position (5, 6), I can see that the goal position (6, 6) is directly adjacent to me and is the only logical move left to make. Since we can move to any adjacent position including diagonals, and (6, 6) is our goal, I'll move there.

My next move: (6, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), starting from the top, moving diagonally down to the right, and then continuing to the goal.

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a slightly different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (6, 6)

In this new maze:
- The path still forms a "Z" shape
- The start position is at the top
- The path moves diagonally down through the middle
- The path ends at the same goal position (6, 6)
- The overall structure is similar but not identical to the original maze
- The path is valid and can be traversed from P to G through empty spaces
