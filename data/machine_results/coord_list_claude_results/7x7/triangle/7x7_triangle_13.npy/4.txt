You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 6)
2. The goal is at (6, 6)
3. I need to find a path through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (2, 6), I can see that:
- (3, 6) is an empty space
- (1, 6) is an empty space

Since the goal is at (6, 6), and I need to move towards the right and down, moving to (3, 6) would be the better choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 6), let me analyze the available empty spaces I can move to:
- (2, 6) would be moving backwards
- (4, 6) is an empty space

Since I need to reach (6, 6), and moving to (4, 6) would bring me closer to the goal while staying on valid empty spaces, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 6), let me analyze the available empty spaces I can move to:
- (3, 6) would be moving backwards
- (5, 6) is an empty space

Since I need to reach (6, 6), and moving to (5, 6) would bring me closer to the goal while staying on valid empty spaces, I choose to move to coordinate (5, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 6), I can see that my final destination (6, 6) is directly adjacent to my position. Since (6, 6) is the goal position and it's reachable from where I am, I choose to move to coordinate (6, 6).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), starting from the top, moving diagonally down to the right, and then continuing to the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)

Empty: (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (6, 6)

This new maze:
- Maintains the same 7x7 size
- Has a clear "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces
- Provides a valid path from P to G
- Has a different arrangement of walls while maintaining the same general shape
- The path zigzags from top to bottom-right, similar to the original but with slightly different positioning
