You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (1, 4)
2. The goal is at (5, 0)
3. I need to move through empty spaces to reach the goal
4. I can move in any direction (including diagonals) as long as I move to an empty space

Looking at the empty spaces near my current position (1, 4), I can see that I need to move towards the bottom-left to eventually reach the goal at (5, 0). 

The available empty spaces near my current position that would take me in the right direction are:
- (1, 3) - directly below my current position

Moving to (1, 3) would be the best next move as it:
1. Is a valid empty space
2. Gets me closer to the goal
3. Keeps more path options open for future moves

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (1, 3), I can see the following empty spaces adjacent to me:
- (1, 2) - directly below
- (2, 3) - to the right

Since the goal is at (5, 0), I need to continue moving downward and eventually to the right. Moving to (1, 2) would be the better choice as it:
1. Continues the path downward towards the goal
2. Maintains flexibility for future moves
3. Is a valid empty space

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 2), I can see the following empty spaces adjacent to me:
- (1, 1) - directly below
- (2, 3) - diagonally up and right

Since the goal is at (5, 0), I need to continue moving downward and eventually to the right. Moving to (1, 1) would be the better choice as it:
1. Continues the path downward towards the goal
2. Gets us closer to the bottom level where we can move right towards the goal
3. Is a valid empty space

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 1), I can see the following empty spaces adjacent to me:
- (1, 0) - directly below
- (2, 0) - diagonally down and right

Since the goal is at (5, 0) and we need to move right along the bottom row to reach it, either move could work. However, moving to (2, 0) would be the better choice as it:
1. Makes progress both downward and rightward towards the goal
2. Gets us closer to the goal position in a single move
3. Is a valid empty space
4. Starts our rightward movement along the bottom row

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 0), I can see the following empty spaces adjacent to me:
- (3, 0) - directly to the right

The choice is clear here as there's only one valid empty space we can move to. Moving to (3, 0) would:
1. Continue our progress rightward towards the goal
2. Keep us on the bottom row where we need to be
3. Is a valid empty space

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 0), I can see the following empty spaces adjacent to me:
- (4, 0) - directly to the right

Again, the choice is clear as there's only one valid empty space we can move to. Moving to (4, 0) would:
1. Continue our progress rightward towards the goal
2. Keep us on the bottom row where we need to be
3. Is a valid empty space
4. Get us just one step away from our goal at (5, 0)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 0), looking at the goal at (5, 0), I can move directly to it since it's adjacent to my current position. This will be the final move to complete the maze.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (5, 0), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape, with a vertical corridor that connects to a horizontal corridor at the bottom.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shape pattern but with slightly different positioning:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 1)

This new maze:
1. Maintains a 7x7 grid size
2. Forms an "L" shape with its corridors
3. Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
4. Is different from the original maze (the vertical part of the "L" is shifted right by one column)
5. The "L" shape is clearly recognizable in the pattern of empty spaces
