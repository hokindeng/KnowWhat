You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (1, 4)
2. The goal is at (5, 0)
3. I need to move through empty spaces to reach the goal
4. I can move in any direction (including diagonals) as long as I move to an empty space

Looking at the empty spaces near my current position (1, 4), I can see that I need to move towards the bottom-left to eventually reach the goal at (5, 0). 

The available empty spaces near my current position that would move me in the right direction are:
- (1, 3) - directly below my current position

Moving to (1, 3) would be the best choice as it gets me closer to the path that leads to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (1, 3) and analyzing the available empty spaces, I need to continue moving towards the goal at (5, 0).

The empty spaces adjacent to my current position are:
- (1, 2) - directly below
- (2, 3) - to the right

Since the goal is at (5, 0), which is towards the bottom-left of the maze, moving down to (1, 2) would be the better choice as it brings me closer to the path that will eventually lead to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (5, 0).

The empty spaces adjacent to my current position are:
- (1, 1) - directly below
- (1, 3) - above (but this would be moving backwards)

Since the goal is at (5, 0), which is towards the bottom-left of the maze, moving down to (1, 1) is the clear choice as it continues our progress towards the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (5, 0).

The empty spaces adjacent to my current position are:
- (1, 0) - directly below
- (2, 0) - diagonally down and right
- (1, 2) - above (but this would be moving backwards)

Since the goal is at (5, 0), and we need to eventually move right to reach it, moving diagonally to (2, 0) would be the most efficient choice as it moves us both down and right in a single move.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 0), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (5, 0).

The empty spaces adjacent to my current position are:
- (3, 0) - directly to the right
- (1, 0) - to the left (but this would be moving backwards)

Since the goal is at (5, 0), which is to the right of our current position, moving to (3, 0) is the clear choice as it continues our progress towards the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 0), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (5, 0).

The empty spaces adjacent to my current position are:
- (4, 0) - directly to the right
- (2, 0) - to the left (but this would be moving backwards)

Since the goal is at (5, 0), which is to the right of our current position, moving to (4, 0) is the clear choice as it continues our progress towards the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 0), I need to make the final move towards the goal at (5, 0).

Looking at the available spaces adjacent to my current position:
- (5, 0) - directly to the right (this is the goal)
- (4, 1) - up
- (3, 0) - to the left (but this would be moving backwards)

Since (5, 0) is the goal position and it's directly adjacent to my current position, I can move there directly.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (5, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape, with one corridor running vertically from top to bottom and another corridor running horizontally at the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an "L" shape but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 0)

This new maze has:
- A vertical corridor running down from (1,1) to (4,1)
- A horizontal corridor at the bottom running from (5,0) to (6,1)
- Forms an "L" shape like the original
- Provides a valid path from P to G
- Has different wall placements while maintaining the same general shape
