You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (4, 1)
2. The goal is at (5, 4)
3. I need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces available and my current position, I can move to:
- (3, 2) - moving diagonally up-right
- (5, 0) - moving diagonally down-left
- (5, 1) - moving down
- (5, 2) - moving diagonally down-right

To get closer to the goal at (5, 4), I should try to move towards the right and down. The best move would be to go to (5, 1), as this puts me in a better position to continue moving towards the goal through the available empty spaces.

I choose to move to: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 1), I can see the following possible moves:
- (5, 0) - moving left
- (5, 2) - moving right
- (5, 3) - moving two spaces right
- (4, 1) - moving up
- (4, 3) - moving diagonally up-right

Since the goal is at (5, 4), I need to continue moving towards the right. The best move would be to go to (5, 2), as this keeps me on a path that will eventually lead to the goal.

I choose to move to: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), I can see the following possible moves:
- (5, 1) - moving left
- (5, 3) - moving right
- (4, 3) - moving diagonally up-right

Since the goal is at (5, 4), I need to continue moving towards the right. The best move would be to go to (5, 3), as this brings me closest to the goal position.

I choose to move to: (5, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 3), I can see that the goal at (5, 4) is directly to my right. Since (5, 4) is not listed in the walls and represents the goal position, I can move there directly.

I choose to move to: (5, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)), they form a rough "Z" shape when connected.

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different orientation and position than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a diagonal "Z" shape from top-left to bottom-right, and there is a clear path from the player position to the goal following this "Z" pattern.
