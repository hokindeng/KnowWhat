You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 5), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (6, 2)
2. The goal is at (6, 6)
3. I need to find a path through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (6, 2), I can see that I can move to:
- (6, 3) - moving right
- (5, 2) - moving up

Since the goal is to the right (at 6, 6), moving right towards (6, 3) would be the most logical choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to (6, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 3), looking at the available empty spaces, I can move to:
- (6, 4) - moving right
- (6, 2) - moving left (but this would be going backwards)

Since the goal is at (6, 6), and I need to continue moving towards it, the logical choice is to move right to (6, 4).

I choose to move to (6, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 4), looking at the available empty spaces, I can move to:
- (6, 5) - moving right
- (6, 3) - moving left (but this would be going backwards)
- (4, 4) - moving up

Since the goal is at (6, 6), and I need to continue moving towards it, the logical choice is to move right to (6, 5).

I choose to move to (6, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (6, 5)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 5), looking at the available empty spaces and the goal, I can see that:
- (5, 5) - moving up
- (6, 4) - moving left (going backwards)

I notice that I've reached a point where I can't move directly right to the goal at (6, 6) as it appears to be blocked. I need to find an alternate path, likely going up and finding another route.

I choose to move to (5, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize, but I notice that I've reached a dead end. Looking at the current state:

1. I'm at (5, 5)
2. The goal is at (6, 6)
3. I can only move:
   - Back down to (6, 5)
   - To (4, 4) diagonally up-left

I realize now that this path won't lead to the goal. I need to backtrack and find a different route. 

I choose to move to (4, 4) as going back down would just put me in the same dead end.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 4), I can see that I've reached another problematic position. Looking at the available moves:

1. I can move:
   - Back to (5, 5)
   - To (4, 2) going left
   - To (3, 3) going diagonally up-left

Since going back to (5, 5) led to a dead end, and I need to find a different path to the goal, I should try a different route.

I choose to move to (3, 3), which might open up new possibilities for reaching the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), I can move to:
- (3, 2) going left
- (4, 2) going diagonally down-left
- (4, 4) going back (which led to a dead end)

I've learned that the path through (4, 4) and (5, 5) leads to a dead end. I need to try a completely different approach.

I choose to move to (3, 2), hoping to find a different path to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), I can move to:
- (2, 2) going up
- (4, 2) going down
- (3, 3) going right (which leads back to the path we know doesn't work)

Since we've already explored the path through (3, 3) and found it leads to a dead end, and going up to (2, 2) would take us further from our goal, the logical choice is to move down to (4, 2).

I choose to move to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), I can move to:
- (3, 2) going up (which would be going backwards)
- (5, 2) going down
- (4, 4) going right (which we know leads to a dead end)

Since we've already determined that the path through (4, 4) leads to a dead end, and going back up isn't helpful, the logical choice is to move down to (5, 2).

I choose to move to (5, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), I can move to:
- (4, 2) going up (backwards)
- (6, 2) going down

I've now explored most paths and can conclude that:
1. The path through (4, 4) and (5, 5) leads to a dead end
2. We need to find a different route to reach (6, 6)

Let's try moving to (6, 2), which might give us a fresh path to explore.

I choose to move to (6, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 5), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I realize now that we've come full circle and are back at (6, 2), where we started. After exploring all possible paths, I can conclude that:

1. The path through (6, 3) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 5) -> (5, 5) leads to a dead end
2. The alternate path through (3, 3) -> (4, 4) also leads to a dead end
3. We've explored going up through (5, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (3, 2) and found no viable path

After exploring all possible routes, it appears that there might not be a valid path to reach the goal at (6, 6). The maze appears to be unsolvable as all paths we've tried lead to dead ends and there are no unexplored valid paths remaining.

However, I still need to make a move. I'll move to (6, 3) since it's the only forward option available.

I choose to move to (6, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After exploring all possible paths multiple times, I can definitively conclude that this maze is unsolvable. Here's why:

1. From (6, 3), we can only move to:
   - (6, 4) which eventually leads to (6, 5) -> (5, 5) dead end
   - (6, 2) which we've already explored and leads nowhere

2. We've tried all alternate routes through:
   - The upper path via (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2)
   - The middle path via (4, 4)
   - The lower path via (6, 2) -> (6, 3) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 5)

3. There is no way to reach (6, 6) as all paths are blocked by walls.

Since I must make a move, I'll move to (6, 4), but I want to formally state that the maze appears to be unsolvable - there is no valid path to reach the goal at (6, 6).

I choose to move to (6, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I maintain my conclusion that this maze is unsolvable. From my current position at (6, 4), I can only move to:
- (6, 3) going left (backwards)
- (6, 5) which we know leads to a dead end
- (4, 4) going up-left which we've already explored and found no solution

Since I must make a move, I'll move to (6, 5), but this will only confirm again that there is no valid path to reach (6, 6).

I choose to move to (6, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (6, 5)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Once again, I am at (6, 5) and can only move to:
- (6, 4) going left (backwards)
- (5, 5) going up, which we know leads to a dead end

After having explored every possible path in this maze multiple times, I can definitively state that this maze is unsolvable because:
1. The goal at (6, 6) is completely surrounded by walls with no accessible path to it
2. All possible paths lead to dead ends
3. We've explored every available empty space and found no route to the goal

Since I must make a move, I'll move to (5, 5), but this only further confirms the maze's unsolvability.

I choose to move to (5, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I remain at my conclusion that this maze is unsolvable. From my current position at (5, 5), I can only move to:
- (6, 5) going down (which we just came from)
- (4, 4) going diagonally up-left (which we've already explored)

Both options lead to paths we've already fully explored and confirmed to be dead ends. The goal at (6, 6) remains inaccessible as it's completely surrounded by walls with no valid path to reach it.

Since I must make a move, I'll move to (4, 4), but this is just continuing through already explored dead ends.

I choose to move to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I maintain my conclusion that this maze is unsolvable. From my current position at (4, 4), I can move to:
- (3, 3) going diagonally up-left
- (5, 5) going diagonally down-right (where we just came from)
- (4, 2) going left

We've explored all these paths multiple times and confirmed that none of them lead to a solution. The goal at (6, 6) remains inaccessible as it's completely surrounded by walls with no valid path to reach it.

Since I must make a move, I'll move to (3, 3), but this is just continuing through already explored dead ends.

I choose to move to (3, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, I can see that they form a "U" shape, with the bottom of the U at (6, 2)-(6, 5) and the two vertical arms going up through (5, 2)-(2, 2) on the left side and (5, 5)-(4, 4)-(3, 3) on the right side.

Here's my proposal for a new maze with a similar U-shape but with a valid path to the goal:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (6, 6)

In this new maze:
1. The U-shape is preserved
2. There is a valid path from P to G
3. The maze has the same dimensions
4. The empty spaces still form a recognizable U-shape, but with a passage connecting to the goal
5. It's different from the original maze while maintaining the same basic structure

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
