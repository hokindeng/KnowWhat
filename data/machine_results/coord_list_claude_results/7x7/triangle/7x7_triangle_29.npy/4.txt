You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Looking at the given coordinates:
1. I'm currently at position (1, 3)
2. The goal is at (1, 5)
3. I can move through empty spaces
4. I need to reach the goal while avoiding walls

From my current position (1, 3), looking at the adjacent empty spaces, I can see that:
- (1, 4) is an empty space
- Moving to (1, 4) would get me closer to the goal at (1, 5)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 4), I can see that:
1. The goal is at (1, 5)
2. I can move directly to (1, 5) as it's adjacent to my current position and is an empty space

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 5), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "S" shape (or reverse "S" shape, depending on orientation). The path snakes from the starting position to the goal position in a curved pattern characteristic of the letter S.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming an S shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form an S shape, but it's oriented differently from the original. The path starts at the bottom of the S and curves up to the goal position at the top of the S. The maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions and provides a valid path from P to G through empty spaces.
