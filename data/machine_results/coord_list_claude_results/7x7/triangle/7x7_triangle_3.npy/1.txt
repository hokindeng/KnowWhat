You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
- I'm currently at (5, 3)
- The goal is at (5, 0)
- I need to move towards the left and up to reach the goal
- I can move diagonally and orthogonally through empty spaces

Looking at the available empty spaces around my current position (5, 3), I can see that:
- Position (5, 2) is empty
- Position (4, 3) is empty
- Position (5, 4) is empty

Since my goal is at (5, 0), and I need to move generally leftward, the best move would be to go to (5, 2), which is one step closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (5, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces around my current position (5, 2), I can see:
- Position (5, 1) is empty
- Position (5, 3) is empty (but this would be moving away from the goal)

The clear choice is to move to (5, 1), as this gets me one step closer to the goal at (5, 0).

I choose to move to: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 1), I'm now just one step away from the goal at (5, 0).

Looking at the available moves, the obvious choice is to move directly to the goal position at (5, 0).

I choose to move to: (5, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "S" shape (or reverse "S" shape, depending on orientation). The path snakes from the bottom-middle area, curves up and to the right, then curves back to the left towards the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming an "S" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

In this new maze, the empty spaces create an "S" shape that curves from the top-left area down and to the right, then curves back to the bottom-right area. The player starts at the top of the "S" and needs to follow the path to reach the goal at the bottom of the "S".
