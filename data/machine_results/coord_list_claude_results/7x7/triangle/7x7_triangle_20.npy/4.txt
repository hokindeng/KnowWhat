You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 2)
2. The goal is at (3, 5)
3. I need to move through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 2), I can see:
- (3, 1) is empty
- (3, 3) is empty
- (2, 2) is empty
- (3, 4) is empty

Since the goal is at (3, 5), and I need to move towards the right, the best move would be to go to (3, 3), as this brings me closer to the goal while staying on a valid path.

I choose to move to: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 3):
- (3, 2) is empty
- (3, 4) is empty
- (2, 4) is empty

Since the goal is to the right at (3, 5), the best move is to go to (3, 4), as this brings me closer to the goal while staying on a valid path.

I choose to move to: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 4), I need to make the final move to reach the goal at (3, 5).

Looking at my current position and the goal:
- I'm at (3, 4)
- The goal is at (3, 5)
- There are no walls between my current position and the goal
- Moving one step right will take me directly to the goal

I choose to move to: (3, 5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "S" shape (or reverse "S" shape), with the path snaking from top to bottom in an S-like curve.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an S-shaped path but with slightly different coordinates:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (2, 5)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form an S shape, but:
- The S is slightly wider in some parts
- The starting and ending positions are different
- The exact coordinates of the path are different
- It still maintains a valid, continuous path from P to G
- The overall dimensions remain 7x7

The path still curves in an S pattern, first going down, then curving right, and then curving back to reach the goal, maintaining the essential S-shaped characteristic of the original maze while being a distinct configuration.
