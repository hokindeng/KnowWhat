You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at position (2, 4)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3, 2)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around the current position (2, 4), I can move to:
- (3, 4) - moving right
- (3, 3) - moving diagonally down-left
- (1, 3) - moving diagonally up-left

Since the goal is at (3, 2), and I need to get to a lower position, moving to (3, 3) would be the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal position.

I choose to move to: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), I need to reach the goal at (3, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 3), I can move to:
- (2, 2) - moving diagonally up-left
- (1, 2) - moving diagonally up-left (in two steps)

Since the goal is at (3, 2) and I need to get to that position, moving to (2, 2) would be the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal position and is an available empty space.

I choose to move to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), I need to reach the goal at (3, 2).

Looking at my current position and the goal position, I can see that:
- I'm at (2, 2)
- The goal is at (3, 2)
- The goal is directly one step below my current position

Since (3, 2) is the goal position and it's adjacent to my current position, I can move there directly.

I choose to move to: (3, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a rough "Z" shape, with a horizontal line at the top, a diagonal line in the middle, and a horizontal line at the bottom.

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with a "Z" shaped path:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a clear "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape
- The "Z" is formed by a top horizontal section (0,2)-(1,2), a diagonal section from top-right to bottom-left, and a bottom horizontal section (3,3)-(4,4)
