You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at position (2, 4)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3, 2)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around the current position (2, 4), I can move to:
- (3, 3) diagonally down-left
- (3, 4) directly down
- (3, 5) diagonally down-right

Since the goal is at (3, 2), and I need to move towards the left, the best move would be to position (3, 3), as this gets me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (3, 3) and the goal position (3, 2), I need to move one step to the left to reach the goal. However, I notice that (3, 2) is not listed in the empty spaces, which means I cannot move there directly.

Looking at the available empty spaces from my current position (3, 3), I can move to:
- (2, 2) diagonally up-left
- (2, 4) diagonally up-right
- (3, 4) right
- (3, 5) far right

Since I need to get to (3, 2), and I can't move there directly, I should move to (2, 2), which is an empty space that gets me closer to the goal's position.

I choose to move to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), looking at the available empty spaces and the goal at (3, 2), I can see that:

- The goal (3, 2) is directly below me
- I can move to the following empty spaces:
  - (1, 2) up
  - (1, 3) diagonally up-right
  - (3, 3) diagonally down-right

Since I'm at (2, 2) and the goal is at (3, 2), and I can't move directly there (as it's not in the empty spaces list), I need to find an indirect path. Looking at the available moves, moving to (3, 3) gets me closest to the goal position while keeping my options open.

I choose to move to: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), looking at the available empty spaces and the goal at (3, 2), I can see that:

- The goal (3, 2) is directly to my left
- I can move to the following empty spaces:
  - (2, 2) diagonally up-left
  - (2, 4) diagonally up-right
  - (3, 4) right
  - (3, 5) far right

Since I can't move directly to the goal (as it's not in the empty spaces list), and I've already tried going through (2, 2), I need to find another path. Looking at the available moves and considering that I've been in this position before, I should try a different approach.

Let me move to: (2, 4)

This might allow me to find a different path to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 4), I can see that I'm getting into a cycle without making progress towards the goal. Let me analyze the situation:

Available moves:
- (3, 3) diagonally down-left
- (3, 4) directly down
- (3, 5) diagonally down-right

Looking at the entire maze and my previous moves, I realize I need to try a different approach. Instead of moving down again, which would likely lead to the same cycle, I should try to reach the goal through the upper path.

The empty spaces include (1, 2) and (1, 3), which might provide a different route to the goal.

Let me move to: (1, 3)

This will allow me to explore the upper path to potentially find a way to reach the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 3), I can see:

Available moves:
- (1, 2) to the left
- (2, 2) diagonally down-left
- (2, 4) diagonally down-right

The goal is at (3, 2), and I need to find a path that leads there. Since I'm trying to reach a lower position, and (2, 2) is both an empty space and moves me closer to the goal, this seems like the best move.

I choose to move to: (2, 2)

This gets me closer to the goal position while staying on valid empty spaces.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), I can see that I'm getting into a similar pattern as before. Let me analyze the entire situation again:

1. The goal is at (3, 2)
2. Available moves:
   - (1, 2) up
   - (1, 3) diagonally up-right
   - (3, 3) diagonally down-right

Looking at the pattern of my previous moves and the layout of empty spaces, I realize that if the goal at (3, 2) is not in the empty spaces list, and I keep cycling through the same positions, this maze might not have a solution. The goal position appears to be surrounded by walls or invalid positions, and there's no way to reach it through the available empty spaces.

However, I still need to make a move. Since I haven't tried going through the upper path completely, let me try:

I choose to move to: (1, 2)

This will allow me to explore if there's any possible solution through the upper path that I might have missed.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After exploring multiple paths and returning to various positions, I can now definitively conclude that this maze has no solution. Here's why:

1. The goal position (3, 2) is not included in the list of empty spaces, which means it's not a position we can actually move to
2. We've explored all possible paths through the available empty spaces
3. We keep cycling through the same positions without being able to reach the goal

However, since I need to make a move, I'll choose:

I choose to move to: (2, 2)

But I want to formally state that this maze appears to be unsolvable because the goal position (3, 2) is not an accessible space in the maze.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), they form a rough "Y" shape. The empty spaces branch from a single point into two separate paths.

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming a "Y" shape, but with a valid path from P to G:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3)

Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

This new maze:
- Maintains the Y-shape of connected corridors
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze
- Is the same 7x7 size
- The Y-shape is formed by a main vertical corridor that splits into two branches, but in this case, the branches are positioned differently and the path is solvable
