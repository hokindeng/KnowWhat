You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the current position (4, 2), I need to reach the goal at (4, 0). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering that I can move in any direction (including diagonally), I can see that I need to move generally northward.

The best next move would be to (3, 1), as this:
1. Moves me closer to the goal
2. Uses an available empty space
3. Avoids all walls
4. Creates a clear path toward the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), I need to reach the goal at (4, 0). Looking at the available empty spaces, I can see that I can move to (3, 0), which will get me closer to the goal position.

Moving to (3, 0) is the best choice because:
1. It's an available empty space
2. It brings me closer to the goal at (4, 0)
3. From there, I'll be able to reach the goal position in the next move

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 0), I can now move directly to the goal position at (4, 0). This is a valid move since:
1. (4, 0) is the goal position
2. It's adjacent to my current position
3. It's not a wall
4. This move will complete the maze

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "7" shape. The vertical line of the "7" runs along the right side (coordinates 6,0 through 6,4), and the horizontal line extends from left to right near the top (coordinates 2,0 through 6,0), with a few additional spaces that were needed to create a valid path from P to G.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "7" shape pattern for its empty spaces, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 0)

In this new maze:
- The horizontal line of the "7" runs along the top (coordinates 3,0 through 6,0)
- The vertical line runs down the left side (coordinates 6,0 through 6,1)
- The path from P to G is valid and follows the "7" shape
- The overall dimensions remain 7x7
- The shape is distinct from the original maze while maintaining the "7" pattern
