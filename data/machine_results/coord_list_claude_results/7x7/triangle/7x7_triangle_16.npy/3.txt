You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at (4, 3)
2. The goal (G) is at (6, 3)
3. I need to find a path through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around the current position (4, 3), I can move to:
- (3, 3) - up
- (4, 4) - right
- (5, 3) - down

Since the goal is at (6, 3), and I need to move towards it, the best move would be to go down to (5, 3), as this brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (5, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 3), looking at the available empty spaces around me, I can move to:
- (4, 3) - up
- (4, 4) - up-right
- (5, 5) - right-up
- (6, 4) - down-right

Since the goal is at (6, 3), I need to get to that horizontal level. The most direct path would be to move to (6, 3), but I notice that coordinate isn't listed in the empty spaces, which means I can't move there directly.

I'll need to find an alternate path. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that I can reach (6, 4) from my current position, and from there I might be able to reach the goal.

I choose to move to: (6, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 4), looking at the available empty spaces around me, I can move to:
- (5, 5) - up-right
- (6, 5) - right
- (6, 6) - right-up

I notice that I still can't move directly to the goal at (6, 3) as it's not listed in the empty spaces. This suggests that either:
1. The goal position is actually a wall (which would make the maze impossible)
2. Or there might be an error in the maze representation

However, I must continue with the available moves. Since none of the available moves get me closer to (6, 3), and I can't see a clear path to victory, I'll move to:

(6, 5)

Note: I want to point out that if the goal at (6, 3) is indeed a wall, this maze might be unsolvable.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze: (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), and plotting them out:

1. The empty spaces form a "7" shape, but it appears to be incomplete or incorrect since the goal position (6, 3) is not reachable through the empty spaces, making the maze unsolvable.

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with a proper "7" shape that is solvable:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2)

Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 6)

This new maze has a clear "7" shape formed by its corridors, with a valid path from start to finish, and maintains the same 7x7 grid size as the original.
