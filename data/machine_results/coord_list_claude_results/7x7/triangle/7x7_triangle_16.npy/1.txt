You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at (4, 3)
2. The goal (G) is at (6, 3)
3. I need to find a path through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around the current position (4, 3), I can move to:
- (3, 3) - up
- (4, 4) - right
- (5, 3) - down

Since the goal is at (6, 3), and I need to move towards it, the best move would be to go down to (5, 3), as this brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (5, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 3), looking at the available empty spaces and considering that the goal is at (6, 3), I can see that I can move to:
- (4, 3) - up
- (4, 4) - up-right
- (5, 5) - right-up
- (6, 4) - down-right

Since the goal is at (6, 3) and I need to get there, I should move to (6, 3) directly since it's adjacent to my current position and it's the goal position.

I choose to move to: (6, 3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), starting from the top, going right, then diagonally down-left, and finally right again to reach the goal.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different positioning:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 6)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (6, 6)

In this new maze, the path still forms a "Z" shape:
- The top horizontal part of the Z is at the top (2,1 to 3,1)
- The diagonal part goes down-right through (4,2) and (5,3)
- The bottom horizontal part goes from (5,6) to (6,6)

The path is valid and can be traversed from P to G while maintaining the same general "Z" shape as the original maze, but with different specific coordinates and slightly different proportions.
