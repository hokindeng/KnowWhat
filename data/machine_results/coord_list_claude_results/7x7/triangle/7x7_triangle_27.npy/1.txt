You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at (4, 4)
2. The goal (G) is at (4, 2)
3. I need to move towards the goal while staying on empty spaces

Looking at the available empty spaces around the current position (4, 4):
- I can move to (3, 3), (3, 4), or (5, 4)
- Since the goal is at (4, 2), which is to the left of the current position, moving towards that direction would be optimal

Therefore, I choose to move to (3, 3), which will get me closer to the goal while staying on a valid path.

My next move is: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the available moves.

Current position: (3, 3)
Goal position: (4, 2)

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to (3, 3):
- I can move to (3, 2), (3, 4)
- Since the goal is at (4, 2), and I need to get there, moving to (3, 2) will get me closer to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to (3, 2).

My next move is: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the available moves.

Current position: (3, 2)
Goal position: (4, 2)

Looking at my current position and the goal:
- I'm at (3, 2) and need to reach (4, 2)
- The goal is directly one step down from my current position
- (4, 2) is not listed in the walls, so it must be a valid move

Therefore, I can move directly to the goal position.

My next move is: (4, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "Z" shape (or reversed "Z" shape, depending on orientation). The path starts at one end, makes a horizontal line, then a diagonal line, and finally another horizontal line.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

In this new maze:
- The top horizontal line of the Z is formed by (1,1) through (4,1)
- The diagonal is formed by (4,1) -> (5,2) -> (5,3)
- The bottom horizontal line is formed by (5,3) -> (6,3)
- The path from P to G follows the Z shape
- The overall size remains 7x7
- The shape is clearly recognizable as a Z but is positioned differently than in the original maze
