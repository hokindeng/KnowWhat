You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information:
1. I'm currently at position (1, 3)
2. The goal is at (1, 5)
3. I can move to any adjacent empty space, including diagonals

Looking at the available empty spaces around my current position (1, 3):
- I can move to (1, 4) which is directly to the right
- I can move to (2, 4) diagonally right and down
- I can move to (2, 2) diagonally left and down
- I can move to (1, 2) directly to the left

Since the goal is at (1, 5), and I need to move rightward to reach it, the best move would be to:

Move to (1, 4)

This gets me closer to the goal position while staying on a valid path.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (1, 4), I can see that I'm now just one step away from the goal at (1, 5).

From my current position, I can move directly to the goal position since (1, 5) is adjacent to my current position.

Therefore, I will:

Move to (1, 5)

This will complete the maze by reaching the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) where the empty spaces form a "Z" shape, but with a different orientation and position than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 1)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a "Z" that's rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise compared to the original. The path starts at the top and zigzags down to the bottom, maintaining the same basic "Z" shape principle but with a different orientation. The player can move from the start position to the goal by following this Z-shaped corridor.
