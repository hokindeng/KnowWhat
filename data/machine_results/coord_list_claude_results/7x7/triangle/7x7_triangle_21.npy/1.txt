You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal at (0,1).

From my current position at (3,4), I need to move towards (0,1), which is up and to the left. Looking at the empty spaces available, I can see that I need to navigate through the corridor of empty spaces.

The available moves from my current position (3,4) are:
- (4,4) down
- (4,3) down-left
- (2,3) up-left

Since the goal is up and to the left, I should try to move in that general direction when possible. The best move appears to be (2,3), as it brings me closer to the goal position.

I choose to move to (2,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0,1).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position, I can move to:
- (2,1) to the left
- (1,2) up-left
- (1,1) up-left diagonal

Since the goal is at (0,1), and I want to get closer to it, I'll choose to move to (1,2), as this brings me closer to the goal while staying on a clear path.

I choose to move to (1,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1,2), I need to make my final move to reach the goal at (0,1).

Looking at the available moves, I can see that:
- (1,1) is to my left
- (0,1) is up from my position and is the goal

Since (0,1) is the goal and it's directly accessible from my current position, I'll move there.

I choose to move to (0,1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), starting from the top left, moving right, then diagonally down to the bottom, and then right again.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different positioning:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (1, 1)

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces still form a "Z" shape
- The path goes from bottom-right to top-left
- The maze is the same size (7x7)
- The pattern is recognizable but distinct from the original
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
