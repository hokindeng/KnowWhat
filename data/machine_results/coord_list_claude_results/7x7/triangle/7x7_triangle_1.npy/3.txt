You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 4)
2. The goal is at (0, 1)
3. I need to find a path through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (2, 4), and considering that I need to generally move towards the goal (which is up and to the left), I can see that:

1. Moving diagonally up-left to (1, 5) is a valid move, as (1, 5) is in the list of empty spaces
2. This would be a good strategic move as it gets me closer to the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

From my current position at (1, 5), I need to reach the goal at (0, 1). Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my position, I can see that:

1. I can move to (0, 5), which is in the list of empty spaces
2. This would get me to the top row, from where I can then move left towards the goal

Moving to (0, 5) seems like the best option as it continues our progress towards the goal while staying on valid empty spaces.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (0, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

From my current position at (0, 5), I need to reach the goal at (0, 1). Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my position:

1. I can move to (0, 4), which is in the list of empty spaces
2. This would get me closer to the goal by moving left along the top row

Moving to (0, 4) is the logical choice as it continues our progress towards the goal while staying on valid empty spaces.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

From my current position at (0, 4), I need to reach the goal at (0, 1). Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my position:

1. I can move to (0, 3), which is in the list of empty spaces
2. This would get me closer to the goal by continuing to move left along the top row

Moving to (0, 3) is the logical choice as it continues our progress towards the goal while staying on valid empty spaces.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

From my current position at (0, 3), I need to reach the goal at (0, 1). Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my position:

1. I can move to (0, 2), which is in the list of empty spaces
2. This would get me closer to the goal by continuing to move left along the top row

Moving to (0, 2) is the logical choice as it continues our progress towards the goal while staying on valid empty spaces.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

From my current position at (0, 2), I need to reach the goal at (0, 1). Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my position:

1. I can move to (1, 1), which is in the list of empty spaces
2. This is the only valid move that will get us closer to the goal, as we can't move directly left to (0, 1) from our current position

Moving to (1, 1) is the necessary step to eventually reach the goal position.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

From my current position at (1, 1), I need to reach the goal at (0, 1). Looking at my position and the goal:

1. I can now move directly up to (0, 1), which is the goal position
2. This is the final move needed to complete the maze

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (0, 1), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "Y" shape (or "fork" shape). The path has three branches that converge at a central point, with one branch extending upward and left (where we navigated), another branch extending right, and a third branch extending downward.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Y" shape pattern with its empty spaces, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3)

Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (5, 3)

In this new maze, the "Y" shape is formed by:
- A vertical corridor in the middle
- Two branches splitting at the top (one going left, one going right)
- One branch extending downward

The path from P to G is valid and follows the Y-shaped corridor system, but the specific arrangement of walls and empty spaces is different from the original maze while maintaining the same general shape concept.
