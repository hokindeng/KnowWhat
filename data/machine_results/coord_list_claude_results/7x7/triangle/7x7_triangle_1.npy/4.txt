You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 4)
2. The goal is at (0, 1)
3. I need to find a path through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 4), I can see that:
- Moving up is blocked by a wall at (2, 3)
- Moving down is blocked by a wall at (2, 5)
- Moving left leads to an empty space at (1, 5)
- Moving right is blocked by a wall at (3, 4)

To get closer to the goal at (0, 1), I should try to move generally towards the left and up. The best available move appears to be to position (1, 5), as it gets me closer to the goal while staying on an empty space.

I choose to move to: (1, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (1, 5), I can see:
- Moving up leads to an empty space at (0, 5)
- Moving down is blocked by a wall at (1, 6)
- Moving left is blocked (no empty space)
- Moving right is blocked by a wall at (2, 5)

The goal is at (0, 1), which means I need to get to the upper part of the maze. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that moving up to (0, 5) and then navigating through the empty spaces at the top row (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2) will eventually let me reach (0, 1).

Therefore, I choose to move to: (0, 5)

This will get me closer to creating a path to the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 5), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 1).

Looking at the available moves:
- Moving left leads to an empty space at (0, 4)
- Moving right leads to an empty space at (0, 6)
- Moving down is blocked by walls

Since the goal is at (0, 1), which is to the left of my current position, and there's a clear path of empty spaces through (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2) leading towards the goal, I should move left.

I choose to move to: (0, 4)

This continues my progress along the top row towards the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 1).

Looking at the available moves:
- Moving left leads to an empty space at (0, 3)
- Moving right leads to an empty space at (0, 5)
- Moving down is blocked by walls

Since the goal is at (0, 1), which is to the left of my current position, and there's a clear path of empty spaces through (0, 3), (0, 2) leading towards the goal, I should continue moving left.

I choose to move to: (0, 3)

This continues my progress along the top row towards the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 1).

Looking at the available moves:
- Moving left leads to an empty space at (0, 2)
- Moving right leads to an empty space at (0, 4)
- Moving down is blocked by walls

Since the goal is at (0, 1), which is to the left of my current position, and there's a clear path through (0, 2) leading towards the goal, I should continue moving left.

I choose to move to: (0, 2)

This continues my progress along the top row towards the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), I'm now very close to the goal at (0, 1).

Looking at the available moves:
- Moving left leads to an empty space at (1, 1)
- Moving right leads to an empty space at (0, 3)
- Moving down is blocked by walls

Since the goal is at (0, 1), and I can see that (1, 1) is an empty space that will let me get closer to the goal, I should move to that position.

I choose to move to: (1, 1)

This will put me in position to reach the goal in the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 1), I can now reach the goal at (0, 1) directly.

Looking at the available moves:
- Moving up leads to the goal position at (0, 1)
- Other directions are either blocked by walls or would take me away from the goal

I choose to move to: (0, 1)

This final move will complete the maze by reaching the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "Y" shape, with:
- A vertical stem running from approximately the middle to the bottom
- Two branches at the top that split and curve outward

Here's my new maze design that maintains this "Y" shape but with a slightly different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3)

Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

In this new maze:
- The Y-shape is maintained but slightly more symmetrical
- The two upper branches of the Y split at a higher point
- The stem of the Y is more centered
- There's still a valid path from P to G
- The overall dimensions remain the same as the original maze
- The shape is clearly recognizable as a Y but with a different specific arrangement of the corridors
