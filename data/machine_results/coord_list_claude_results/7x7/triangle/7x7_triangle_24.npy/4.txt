You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (5, 6)
2. The goal is at (3, 5)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (5, 6), I can move to:
- (5, 5)
- (4, 6)
- (6, 6)

Since my goal is at (3, 5), moving to (5, 5) would bring me closer to the goal position.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (5, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (5, 5), I can see that:
1. The goal is at (3, 5)
2. I need to move upward to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (5, 5), I can move to:
- (4, 4)
- (5, 6)
- (6, 6)

Since my goal is at (3, 5), moving to (4, 4) would bring me closer to the goal position, as it moves me upward and keeps me on a path that can reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (4, 4), I can see that:
1. The goal is at (3, 5)
2. I need to move upward and slightly right to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 4), I can move to:
- (3, 4)
- (5, 5)

Since my goal is at (3, 5), moving to (3, 4) would bring me closer to the goal position, as it moves me upward and puts me in a position where I can then move right to reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (3, 4), I can see that:
1. The goal is at (3, 5)
2. I need to move one step to the right to reach the goal

Looking at my current position (3, 4) and the goal position (3, 5), I can see that they are directly adjacent. Since (3, 5) is not listed in the walls, I can move there directly.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 5), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern) when viewed from above.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different orientation and position than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (5, 3)

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form a "Z" that starts at the top right area and ends at the middle-left area
- The path from P to G is continuous and traversable
- The overall dimensions are maintained at 7x7
- The shape is clearly recognizable as a "Z" but is positioned differently from the original maze
