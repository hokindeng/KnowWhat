You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (4, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at (2, 5)
2. The goal (G) is at (4, 5)
3. I need to find a path through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the available empty spaces around the current position (2, 5):
- I can move to (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6)

Since the goal is at (4, 5), and I need to move downward and slightly to the right, the best move would be to position myself at (3, 4), which will help me get closer to the goal while staying on valid empty spaces.

I choose to move to: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (4, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current position: (3, 4)
Goal position: (4, 5)

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 4):
- I can move to (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)

Since the goal is at (4, 5), I need to find a path that will eventually let me reach that position. Looking at the layout, I can see that I'll need to go around through the right side of the maze to reach the goal.

The best move would be to go to (3, 6), which will allow me to then move down towards the goal position through the right side of the maze.

I choose to move to: (3, 6)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation). The path starts at the top, goes down, and then makes a right turn to reach the goal.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (6, 5)

In this new maze, the "L" shape is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise compared to the original. The path starts from the top and goes straight down, maintaining the "L" shape characteristic but with a different orientation. The player starts at the top of the vertical line and needs to move down to reach the goal at the bottom.
