You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the current position (3,3), I need to reach the goal at (6,1). Looking at the empty spaces available and considering that I can move in any direction (including diagonals), I can see that I need to generally move towards the bottom-left of the maze.

From my current position at (3,3), I can see that moving to (4,2) is a valid move that will help me progress towards the goal. This position is:
1. Empty (it's in the list of empty spaces)
2. Adjacent to my current position (diagonally)
3. Moves me closer to the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6,1). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering my options:

I can see that moving to (5,1) is a valid move because:
1. It's in the list of empty spaces
2. It's adjacent to my current position (diagonally)
3. It moves me closer to the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (5,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5,1), I can now reach the goal at (6,1) in one move since:
1. It's adjacent to my current position (horizontally)
2. It's our target destination

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (6,1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "S" shape, starting from the top-right area, curving through the middle, and ending at the bottom-left area.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming an "S" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 2)

In this new maze:
- The path still forms an "S" shape
- The player starts at the top of the "S" (1,1)
- The goal is at the bottom of the "S" (6,2)
- The empty spaces curve through the middle of the maze
- It's different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape pattern
- It's solvable by moving through the connected empty spaces
