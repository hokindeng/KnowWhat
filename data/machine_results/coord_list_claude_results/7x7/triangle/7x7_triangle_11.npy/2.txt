You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the current player position (4,1), I need to reach the goal at (5,4). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering the walls, I can see that I need to move towards the goal while staying on valid paths.

The empty spaces form a path that I can follow, and I can move to any adjacent empty space. Looking at the coordinates near my current position (4,1), I can see that (3,1) and (3,2) are valid empty spaces.

Since the goal is to the right and down from my current position, I should try to move in that general direction when possible. Moving to (3,2) would be a good next step as it brings me closer to a path that leads to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (5,4). Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position, I can see that (4,3) is a valid empty space that will help me progress towards the goal.

Moving to (4,3) will bring me closer to the goal position and maintain my path on valid empty spaces.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,3), I need to reach the goal at (5,4). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering that I can move diagonally, I can see that (6,4) is an empty space that will get me closer to the goal.

Moving to (6,4) will put me in a better position to reach the goal at (5,4) in the next move.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (6,4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "J" shape. The path starts at the top, curves down and then extends to the right.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) where the empty spaces form a "J" shape, but with slightly different wall placements while maintaining the general structure:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (6, 4)

In this new maze, I've maintained the "J" shape but slightly modified the path while keeping it functional. The path still allows movement from the player position to the goal through connected empty spaces, and the overall "J" shape is preserved but with some variations in the exact positions of walls and corridors.
