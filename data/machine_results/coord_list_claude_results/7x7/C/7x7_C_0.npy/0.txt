You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (1, 2)
2. The goal is at (4, 3)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (1, 2):
- I can move to (1, 1) or (1, 3)
- Moving towards (1, 3) gets me closer to the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (1, 3), I can analyze the available moves:

1. I can move to:
   - (1, 2) (going back)
   - (1, 4) (moving right)

2. Since I want to progress towards the goal at (4, 3), moving to (1, 4) gets me closer to the goal position and opens up new path possibilities.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (1, 4), I can analyze the available moves:

1. I can move to:
   - (1, 3) (going back)

I notice that I've reached a dead end at (1, 4). I need to backtrack and find a different path. The goal at (4, 3) must be reachable through another route.

Let's go back to (1, 3) and try a different path.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (1, 3), I need to try a different path since going right led to a dead end.

1. I can move to:
   - (1, 2) (going back)

Since moving right didn't work, I need to backtrack and try going through the path that leads through (1, 1) and then downward, as I can see there are empty spaces at (2, 1), (3, 1), and (4, 1) that might lead to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (1, 2), I can see that:

1. I can move to:
   - (1, 1) (going left)
   - (1, 3) (going right, but we know that path leads to a dead end)

Since we've already tried the right path and found it doesn't work, I should move to (1, 1) which will allow me to access the vertical path of empty spaces leading down through (2, 1), (3, 1), and (4, 1), which might help me reach the goal at (4, 3).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (1, 1), I can see that:

1. I can move to:
   - (1, 2) (going right, but we've already explored that path)
   - (2, 1) (going down)

Since going right leads to the path we've already determined doesn't work, I should move down to (2, 1) which continues along the vertical path of empty spaces that might lead us to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (2, 1), I can see that:

1. I can move to:
   - (1, 1) (going up, but that's backtracking)
   - (3, 1) (going down)

Continuing down the vertical path seems to be the best option, as it gets us closer to the goal's row (row 4), and we can see there are empty spaces at (4, 1) and (4, 2) that might help us reach the goal at (4, 3).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (3, 1), I can see that:

1. I can move to:
   - (2, 1) (going up, but that's backtracking)
   - (4, 1) (going down)

Moving to (4, 1) gets us to the same row as the goal, and I can see there's an empty space at (4, 2) which will get us closer to the goal at (4, 3).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (4, 1), I can see that:

1. I can move to:
   - (3, 1) (going up, but that's backtracking)
   - (4, 2) (going right)

Moving to (4, 2) gets us closer to the goal at (4, 3). We're now on the same row as the goal and need to move rightward to reach it.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (4, 2), I can see that:

1. I can move to:
   - (4, 1) (going left, but that's backtracking)
   - (4, 3) (going right, which is the goal!)

The goal is directly to our right at (4, 3), and we can move there!

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 3), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape. The vertical part of the L runs from (1,1) down to (4,1), and the horizontal part extends from (4,1) to (4,4).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming an L shape, but with a different orientation:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 1)

In this new maze, I've created an L shape that's rotated 90 degrees from the original. The long vertical corridor runs from (1,1) to (5,1), making it a valid path from the player position to the goal. The maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions as the original while creating a recognizable L-shaped corridor pattern.
