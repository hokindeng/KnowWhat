You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (1, 2)
2. The goal is at (4, 3)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (1, 2):
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall
- Left: (1, 1) is empty
- Right: (1, 3) is empty

To make progress toward the goal (which is to the right and down), I should first move right to position (1, 3).

My next move: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and available moves.

From position (1, 3), I can see:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall
- Left: (1, 2) is empty
- Right: (1, 4) is empty

Since the goal (4, 3) is to the right and down, and I need to find a path around the walls, I should move right to (1, 4) to continue making progress.

My next move: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and available moves.

From position (1, 4), I can see:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall
- Left: (1, 3) is empty
- Right: Wall

I need to find a path that will eventually lead me to the goal at (4, 3). Looking at the empty spaces, I notice there's a path that goes through (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), and then to (4, 2) which will get me closer to the goal.

Since I can't move right or down from my current position, I need to backtrack. I should move left and then try to find the path that leads down through the empty spaces.

My next move: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and available moves.

From position (1, 3), I can see:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall
- Left: (1, 2) is empty
- Right: (1, 4) is empty

I need to continue backtracking to reach the path that will lead me down through (2, 1), (3, 1), and (4, 1). To do this, I should move left to (1, 2).

My next move: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and available moves.

From position (1, 2), I can see:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall
- Left: (1, 1) is empty
- Right: (1, 3) is empty

I need to get to the path that leads down through (2, 1), (3, 1), and (4, 1). From my current position, I should move left to (1, 1), which will allow me to then move down to (2, 1) in my next turn.

My next move: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

From position (1, 1), I can see:
- Up: Wall
- Down: (2, 1) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: (1, 2) is empty

Now I can start moving down the path that will lead me closer to the goal. I should move down to (2, 1), which is the start of the vertical path that will eventually let me reach the goal area.

My next move: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape. The vertical part of the L runs from (1,1) down to (4,1), and the horizontal part extends from (4,1) to (4,4).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an L-shape pattern, but with the L rotated 90 degrees clockwise:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,0), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,0), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,0), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)
Empty: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)
Player position: (1,1)
Goal: (5,1)

In this new maze, the L-shape is formed by a horizontal corridor at the top (from player to the right), and then a vertical corridor down to the goal. The path is still navigable, the maze is the same size, but the L-shape is positioned differently than in the original maze.
