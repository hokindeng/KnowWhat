You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (1, 2)
2. The goal is at (4, 3)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (1, 2):
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall
- Left: (1, 1) is empty
- Right: (1, 3) is empty

To make progress toward the goal (which is to the right and down), I should first move right to position (1, 3).

My next move: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and available moves.

From position (1, 3), I can see:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall
- Left: (1, 2) is empty
- Right: (1, 4) is empty

Since I need to get to (4, 3) and I can't go down directly from here, I should continue moving right to (1, 4) to find a path that will eventually let me move downward.

My next move: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and available moves.

From position (1, 4), I can see:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall
- Left: (1, 3) is empty
- Right: Wall

I've reached a dead end going right, and I can't progress toward the goal from here. I need to backtrack and try a different path. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see there's a path going down through (2,1), (3,1), and (4,1) that might help me reach the goal.

I should move left back to (1, 3).

My next move: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and available moves.

From position (1, 3), I can see:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall
- Left: (1, 2) is empty
- Right: (1, 4) is empty

I need to continue backtracking to get to a position where I can move down. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see there's a path through (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) that will let me get closer to the goal.

I should move left to (1, 2).

My next move: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and available moves.

From position (1, 2), I can see:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall
- Left: (1, 1) is empty
- Right: (1, 3) is empty

I need to get to the path that goes down through (2,1), (3,1), and (4,1). To do this, I should move left to (1, 1), which will allow me to then move down to (2,1).

My next move: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and available moves.

From position (1, 1), I can see:
- Up: Wall
- Down: (2, 1) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: (1, 2) is empty

Now I can start moving down through the vertical path. Moving down to (2,1) is the next step in reaching the goal, as it will let me continue down to (3,1) and (4,1), from where I can move right towards the goal.

My next move: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- Down: (3, 1) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: Wall

I should continue moving down along this vertical path to get closer to the goal. Moving to (3,1) is the next logical step, as it will get me closer to (4,1), from where I can move right towards the goal.

My next move: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "L" shape. The vertical part of the L runs from (1,1) down to (4,1), and the horizontal part extends from (4,1) to (4,4).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming an L shape, but with a different orientation:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 1)

In this new maze, the L shape is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise compared to the original. The vertical part of the L runs from (1,1) to (5,1). The path from player to goal is straightforward, moving straight down along the vertical corridor. This maintains the L-shape pattern while being distinct from the original maze.
