You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
- I'm currently at position (5, 0)
- The goal is at position (1, 0)
- I can only move through empty spaces
- I need to move upward along the leftmost column to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that I can move up to position (4, 0), which is the next logical step toward the goal.

My next move should be to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing along the path toward the goal, I need to keep moving up along the leftmost column (x=0).

From my current position at (4, 0), I can see that (3, 0) is an empty space.

My next move should be to: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing to move up along the leftmost column toward the goal.

From my current position at (3, 0), I can see that (2, 0) is an empty space.

My next move should be to: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting closer to the goal. From my current position at (2, 0), I can see that the goal position (1, 0) is just one step up.

My next move should be to: (1, 0)

This move should take me directly to the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape. The vertical part of the L runs along the leftmost column (from position 5,0 to 0,0), and the horizontal part extends to the right at the bottom (from 5,0 to 5,4).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size that also forms an "L" shape, but with the L flipped horizontally (mirrored):

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (1, 0)

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the L is still along column 0, but starts from position (5,5)
- The horizontal part extends along row 5
- The path from P to G is still valid through empty spaces
- The L shape is maintained but with different dimensions
- The maze has the same overall size as the original
