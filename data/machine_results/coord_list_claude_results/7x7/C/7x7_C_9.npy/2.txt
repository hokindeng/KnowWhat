You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (5, 0)
2. The goal is at position (1, 0)
3. I need to move along the empty spaces to reach the goal
4. I can only move up, down, left, or right

Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that there's a clear path along the bottom row (y=0) and then up to the goal.

From my current position at (5, 0), I should move one step left to position (4, 0).

My next move: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing along the path to the goal, I need to keep moving left along the bottom row (y=0).

From my current position at (4, 0), I should move one step left to position (3, 0).

My next move: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing to move towards the goal, I'll keep moving left along the bottom row (y=0).

From my current position at (3, 0), I should move one step left to position (2, 0).

My next move: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'm getting closer to the goal. From my current position at (2, 0), I need to move one more step left to reach position (1, 0), which is the goal position.

My next move: (1, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape. The vertical part of the L is formed by the spaces at (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), and the horizontal part is formed by the spaces along the bottom row (0,0) through (5,0).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an L shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1)

Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (0, 0)

In this new maze, I've shifted the vertical part of the L up by 3 units (it now occupies y positions 0-1 instead of 1-4), but maintained the same basic L shape. The path is still navigable from P to G, and the overall dimensions of the maze remain the same.
