You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (5, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 3)
2. The goal is at (5, 1)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 3):
- Up: (3, 2) is empty
- Down: (3, 4) is empty
- Left: Position blocked by wall
- Right: Position blocked by wall

Since the goal is at (5, 1), and I need to eventually move towards the left side of the maze, I should first move up towards (3, 2), as this will help me get closer to the path that leads to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to position (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (5, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up: (3, 1) is empty
- Down: (3, 3) is empty
- Left: Position blocked by wall
- Right: Position blocked by wall

Since the goal is at (5, 1), and I need to get to that level, moving up to (3, 1) would be the best choice as it brings me closer to the path that will lead to the goal position.

Therefore, my next move is to position (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (5, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up: Position blocked by wall
- Down: (3, 2) is empty
- Left: Position blocked by wall
- Right: (4, 1) is empty

Since the goal is at (5, 1) and we need to move right to reach it, and (4, 1) is an empty space, moving right is the clear choice as it brings us directly closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to position (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up: Position blocked by wall
- Down: Position blocked by wall
- Left: (3, 1) is empty
- Right: (5, 1) is the goal position

Since the goal is at (5, 1) and it's directly to my right, and this position is accessible (not marked as a wall), moving right is the obvious choice as it will take me directly to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to position (5, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape. The vertical part of the L runs from (3, 4) to (3, 1), and the horizontal part extends from (4, 1) to (6, 1), with some additional branches at (6, 2), (6, 3), and (6, 4).

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an L shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (6, 1)

In this new maze:
- The L shape is cleaner and more defined
- The vertical part of the L runs from (3, 2) to (3, 1)
- The horizontal part runs from (4, 1) to (6, 1)
- I removed the additional branches to make the L shape more obvious
- The path from P to G is still valid and follows the L shape
- The overall size of the maze remains 7x7
