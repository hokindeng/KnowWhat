You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 2)
2. The goal is at (2, 4)
3. I need to move through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 2), I can move:
- Up to (2, 2)
- Down to (4, 2)

Since the goal is at (2, 4), and I need to eventually move upward and right to reach it, the best first move would be to move up to (2, 2).

My next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), looking at the empty spaces around me, I can move:
- Right to (2, 3)
- Down to (3, 2)

Since the goal is at (2, 4), and I need to move right to reach it, the logical next move is to go right to (2, 3).

My next move: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 3), looking at the empty spaces around me, I can move:
- Left to (2, 2)

I notice that I cannot directly move right to (2, 4) as it's not in the list of empty spaces. Looking at the overall maze structure, I need to find an alternate path to reach (2, 4).

Since going forward is blocked and the only available move is backwards, I'll need to go back to (2, 2) and find a different route.

My next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), I can move:
- Right to (2, 3)
- Down to (3, 2)

Since I've already tried going right and found it doesn't lead to the goal, I should try going down to explore the lower path. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see there's a path that goes down and then might allow me to loop around to reach the goal.

My next move: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), I can move:
- Up to (2, 2)
- Down to (4, 2)

Looking at the empty spaces, I can see there's a path that goes down and then extends to the right through (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), which might allow me to eventually reach the goal at (2, 4).

Let's explore this path by moving down.

My next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), I can move:
- Up to (3, 2)
- Down to (5, 2)

Following the path I identified earlier that might lead to the goal, I should continue moving down to eventually reach the corridor that extends to the right.

My next move: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), I can move:
- Up to (4, 2)
- Down to (6, 2)

Following the path towards the right corridor, I should move down to (6, 2), which will then allow me to move right through the corridor (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5).

My next move: (6, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 2), I can move:
- Up to (5, 2)
- Right to (6, 3)

Now that I'm at the bottom of the maze, I should move right through the corridor to try to find a path up to the goal. Let's move right.

My next move: (6, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 3), I can move:
- Left to (6, 2)
- Right to (6, 4)

Continuing along the corridor to the right seems to be the best option, as it might lead to a path that will allow me to reach the goal at (2, 4).

My next move: (6, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 4), I can move:
- Left to (6, 3)
- Right to (6, 5)

Let's continue moving right to (6, 5) to explore if there's a path that leads up towards the goal at (2, 4).

My next move: (6, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (6, 5)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 5), I can only move:
- Left to (6, 4)

Looking at the empty spaces and walls, I can see that I've reached a dead end. There's no path upward from this position, and the only empty space at this level that might help reach the goal is (2, 5), but there's no way to reach it from here due to the walls.

I need to backtrack and try a different approach.

My next move: (6, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 4), I can move:
- Left to (6, 3)
- Right to (6, 5)

Since I've already explored to the right and found a dead end, and there's no way up from this corridor, I should continue backtracking to try to find a different path to the goal.

My next move: (6, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 3), I can move:
- Left to (6, 2)
- Right to (6, 4)

Since I've already explored the right path and found it doesn't lead to the goal, I should continue backtracking by moving left. We need to try to find a different approach to reach the goal at (2, 4).

My next move: (6, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 2), I can move:
- Up to (5, 2)
- Right to (6, 3)

Since we've already explored the right path and found it doesn't lead to the goal, we should continue backtracking upward. We need to get back to the upper part of the maze to try a different approach to reach (2, 4).

My next move: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), I can move:
- Up to (4, 2)
- Down to (6, 2)

Since we've already explored the lower path and found it doesn't lead to the goal, we should continue moving up to try to find a different route to the goal at (2, 4).

My next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), I can move:
- Up to (3, 2)
- Down to (5, 2)

We should continue moving up, as we need to get back to the upper part of the maze where we might find a path to reach the goal at (2, 4).

My next move: (3, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)), they form:

1. The shape is a "7" (when viewed normally, not rotated)
- There's a horizontal line at the top (2,2 to 2,3 and 2,5)
- There's a vertical line going down (3,2 to 6,2)
- There's a horizontal line at the bottom right (6,3 to 6,5)

2. Here's a new maze with empty spaces forming a "7" shape:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0), (2,1), (2,4), (2,6), (3,0), (3,1), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,0), (4,1), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,0), (5,1), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,0), (6,1), (6,6)
Empty: (2,2), (2,3), (2,5), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)
Player position: (2,2)
Goal: (2,5)

This new maze maintains the "7" shape but has a different start and goal position, making it a distinct puzzle while preserving the characteristic shape.
