You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 2)
2. The goal is at (2, 4)
3. I need to move through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 2), I can move:
- Up to (2, 2)
- Down to (4, 2)

Since the goal is at (2, 4), and I need to eventually move upward and right to reach it, the best first move would be to move up to (2, 2).

My next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), looking at the empty spaces around me, I can move:
- Right to (2, 3)
- Down to (3, 2)

Since the goal is at (2, 4), and I need to move right to reach it, the logical next move is to go right to (2, 3).

My next move: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 3), looking at the empty spaces around me, I can move:
- Left to (2, 2)

I notice that I cannot directly move right to (2, 4) as it's not in the list of empty spaces. Looking at the overall maze structure, I need to find an alternate path to reach (2, 4).

Since going forward is blocked and the only available move is backwards, I'll need to go back to (2, 2) and find a different route.

My next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), I need to find a path to (2, 4). Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that:
- I can move down to (3, 2)
- I can move right to (2, 3)

Since I've already tried going right and found it's a dead end, and I can't directly reach the goal from there, I should try going down to explore the lower path. This might lead to a route that can circle around to reach the goal.

My next move: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), I can move:
- Up to (2, 2)
- Down to (4, 2)

Looking at the empty spaces and the goal position (2, 4), I can see that I need to find a path that might go around through the lower part of the maze. Since I've already tried the upper path, let's explore downward to see if we can find a route that circles around to the goal.

My next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), I can move:
- Up to (3, 2)
- Down to (5, 2)

Looking at the empty spaces, I can see there's a path that continues downward and then potentially curves around through (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), and possibly up to (2, 5) which would get us closer to the goal at (2, 4). Let's continue exploring this path by moving down.

My next move: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), I can move:
- Up to (4, 2)
- Down to (6, 2)

Following my previous logic of trying to find a path that curves around, I should continue moving down to (6, 2), which will then allow me to move right through (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5) and potentially find a way up to (2, 5) which would get us closer to the goal at (2, 4).

My next move: (6, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 2), I can move:
- Up to (5, 2)
- Right to (6, 3)

Following the path I identified earlier, I should move right to (6, 3), which will allow me to continue through (6, 4), (6, 5) and eventually find a way up to (2, 5), getting closer to the goal at (2, 4).

My next move: (6, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 3), I can move:
- Left to (6, 2)
- Right to (6, 4)

Continuing with the plan to move around the right side of the maze, I should move right to (6, 4), which will then allow me to reach (6, 5) and eventually find a way up to (2, 5), getting closer to the goal at (2, 4).

My next move: (6, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 4), I can move:
- Left to (6, 3)
- Right to (6, 5)

Continuing with the plan to reach (2, 5), I should move right to (6, 5). From there, I should be able to find a way up to (2, 5), which is adjacent to our goal at (2, 4).

My next move: (6, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (6, 5)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 5), I can move:
- Left to (6, 4)

Looking at the empty spaces, I notice that I've reached a dead end at (6, 5). There's no direct path up to (2, 5) as I had hoped, since all the spaces between (6, 5) and (2, 5) are walls. I need to backtrack and try a different route.

My next move: (6, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 4), I can move:
- Left to (6, 3)
- Right to (6, 5)

Since I've already discovered that going right to (6, 5) leads to a dead end, and I need to backtrack to find a different route, I should move left to (6, 3).

My next move: (6, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 3), I can move:
- Left to (6, 2)
- Right to (6, 4)

Since I've already explored the path to the right and found it leads to a dead end, and I need to backtrack further to find a different route to the goal, I should move left to (6, 2).

My next move: (6, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)

Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 2), I can move:
- Up to (5, 2)
- Right to (6, 3)

Since I've already explored the path to the right and found it leads to a dead end, and I need to continue backtracking to find a different route to the goal, I should move up to (5, 2).

My next move: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), I can move:
- Up to (4, 2)
- Down to (6, 2)

Since I've already explored the path downward and found it leads to a dead end, I should continue backtracking upward to try to find a different route to the goal. 

My next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), I can move:
- Up to (3, 2)
- Down to (5, 2)

Since I've already explored the path downward and found it leads to a dead end, I should continue backtracking upward. Moving up to (3, 2) will get me closer to the goal area, and from there I can try to find a different route to reach (2, 4).

My next move: (3, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)), they form:

1. The shape is a backwards "L" or an inverted "7"

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a backwards "L":

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)

Empty: (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)

Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a backwards "L" shape, but it's rotated and positioned differently compared to the original. The path is still valid as you can move from the player position to the goal through the empty spaces.
