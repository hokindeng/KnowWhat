You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 2)
2. The goal is at (2, 4)
3. I need to move through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 2), I can move to:
- (2, 2) by moving up
- (4, 2) by moving down

Since the goal is at (2, 4), and I need to eventually move upward and right to reach it, moving up to (2, 2) is the logical first step.

I choose to move to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), looking at the available empty spaces, I can move to:
- (2, 3) by moving right
- (3, 2) by moving down

Since the goal is at (2, 4), and I need to move right to reach it, moving to (2, 3) is the best choice as it keeps me on the same row and moves me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 3), looking at the available empty spaces and the goal position, I can see that I cannot directly move to (2, 4) as it's not in the list of empty spaces. I need to find an alternate route.

Looking at my available moves:
- I can move left to (2, 2)
- I can move to (2, 5), but I'd need to find a path around the obstacle

Since I can't move directly to the goal, I'll need to find a path around. Looking at the empty spaces, there appears to be a path that goes down and around through (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), and then back up to (2, 5), which can then reach the goal at (2, 4).

The first step in this alternate route would be to move back to (2, 2) and then work our way down.

I choose to move to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), I need to start making my way down to access the path that will lead around to the goal.

Looking at my available moves:
- (2, 3) which I just came from
- (3, 2) moving down

Since I've determined I need to take the path that goes down and around, I'll move down to (3, 2) as the first step in that direction.

I choose to move to: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

- (4, 2) moving down

To continue with the plan of going down and around, I'll move down to (4, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path requires going down one side of the U, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with a U-shaped path, but with the U shifted to a different position:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 1)

In this new maze, the U shape is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise compared to the original. The path goes from top to bottom along one side of the U, and then back up the other side. The walls and empty spaces still form a clear U shape, but in a different orientation, demonstrating the same basic pattern while being a distinct maze.
