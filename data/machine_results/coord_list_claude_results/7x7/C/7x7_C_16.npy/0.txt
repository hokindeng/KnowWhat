You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (3, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (6, 5)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From what I understand:
1. I'm at position (6, 5)
2. The goal is at (4, 0)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I can move up, down, left, or right

Looking at the coordinates:
- I'm currently at (6, 5)
- I can see that (6, 4) is an empty space
- Moving up towards (6, 4) would get me closer to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (6, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (3, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (6, 4) and the available empty spaces, I need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 0).

I can see that (6, 3) is an empty space, and moving there would continue my progress towards the goal by moving upward.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (6, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (3, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (6, 3) and the available empty spaces, I need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 0).

I can see that (6, 2) is an empty space, and moving there would continue my progress towards the goal by moving upward.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (6, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)

Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (6, 2) and the available empty spaces, I need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 0).

I can see that (6, 1) is an empty space, and moving there would continue my progress towards the goal by moving upward.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (6, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)

Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (6, 1) and the available empty spaces, I need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 0).

I can see that (6, 0) is an empty space, and moving there would continue my progress towards the goal by moving upward.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (6, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)

Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (6, 0) and the available empty spaces, I need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 0).

I can see that (5, 0) is an empty space, and moving there would get me closer to the goal by moving left.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (5, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (5, 0) and the available empty spaces, I need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 0).

I can see that (4, 0) is the goal position, and it's directly to my left. Moving there would complete the maze.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape. The vertical part of the L runs along the right edge (at x=6) from y=5 to y=0, and then the horizontal part runs along the bottom (at y=0) from x=6 to x=1.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an L shape, but mirrored horizontally (the vertical part of the L is on the left side):

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (6, 0)

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the L runs along the left edge (x=0)
- The horizontal part runs along the bottom (y=0)
- The player starts at the top of the vertical segment
- The goal is at the end of the horizontal segment
- The path is still continuous and solvable
- The L shape is clearly recognizable but different from the original maze
