You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From what I can understand:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 0)
2. The goal is at (6, 3)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I can only move up, down, left, or right (no diagonals)

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 0):
- Left: (2, 0) is empty
- Right: (4, 0) is empty
- Up and Down are not possible due to walls

Since the goal is at (6, 3), and I need to eventually move right and down to reach it, moving right to (4, 0) would be the better choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 0), let me analyze the available moves:
- Left: (3, 0) is empty
- Right: (5, 0) is empty
- Up and Down are not possible due to walls

Since I need to reach the goal at (6, 3), and I need to continue moving towards the right to eventually reach it, the best move would be to continue right to (5, 0).

I choose to move to: (5, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 0), let me analyze the available moves:
- Left: (4, 0) is empty
- Right: (6, 0) is empty
- Up and Down are not possible due to walls

Since I need to reach the goal at (6, 3), and I need to continue moving towards the right and eventually up, moving to (6, 0) would be the best choice as it puts me in position to start moving up through the available path.

I choose to move to: (6, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 0), let me analyze the available moves:
- Left: (5, 0) is empty
- Up: not possible (wall)
- Down: (6, 1) is empty
- Right: not possible (edge of maze)

Since I need to reach the goal at (6, 3), which is directly above my current position on the same column, I need to move up through the available path at (6, 1), (6, 2), and eventually to (6, 3).

I choose to move to: (6, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 2)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 1), let me analyze the available moves:
- Left: not possible (wall)
- Up: (6, 2) is empty
- Down: (6, 0) is empty
- Right: not possible (edge of maze)

Since I need to reach the goal at (6, 3), and I'm already on the correct column (6), I need to continue moving up to get closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (6, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 2), let me analyze the available moves:
- Left: not possible (wall)
- Up: (6, 3) is the goal
- Down: (6, 1) is empty
- Right: not possible (edge of maze)

I can see that the goal position (6, 3) is directly above my current position and it's accessible. This is the final move needed to reach the goal.

I choose to move to: (6, 3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape. The path starts at the top, has a horizontal corridor, and then turns 90 degrees to form a vertical corridor on the right side.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different configuration:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

In this new maze:
- The horizontal part of the "L" is along y=1
- The vertical part of the "L" is along x=6
- The player starts at the left end of the horizontal corridor
- The goal is at the top of the vertical corridor
- The path is still clearly L-shaped but rotated 90 degrees compared to the original
