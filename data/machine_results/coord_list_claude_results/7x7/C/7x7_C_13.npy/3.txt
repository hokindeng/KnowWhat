You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 0)
2. The goal is at (6, 3)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I need to avoid walls

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 0), I can see that:
- To the left is (2, 0), which is an empty space
- To the right is (4, 0), which is an empty space
- Up and down movements are blocked by walls

Since the goal is at (6, 3), and I need to move towards the right and down eventually, moving right to (4, 0) would be the better choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 0), let me analyze my possible moves:
- To the left is (3, 0), which is an empty space
- To the right is (5, 0), which is an empty space
- Up and down movements are blocked by walls

Since I need to reach the goal at (6, 3), and I need to continue moving towards the right to eventually reach it, I should move to (5, 0).

I choose to move to: (5, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 0), let me analyze my possible moves:
- To the left is (4, 0), which is an empty space
- To the right is (6, 0), which is an empty space
- Up and down movements are blocked by walls

Since I need to reach the goal at (6, 3), and I need to continue moving towards the right and eventually up, moving to (6, 0) is the best choice as it will allow me to then move up through the empty spaces at (6, 1) and (6, 2) to get closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (6, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 0), let me analyze my possible moves:
- To the left is (5, 0), which is an empty space
- Up is (6, 1), which is an empty space
- Right and down movements are blocked by walls

Since I need to reach the goal at (6, 3), and I need to move upward to get there, moving to (6, 1) is the clear choice as it brings me closer to the goal while staying on the rightmost column.

I choose to move to: (6, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 2)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 1), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Down is (6, 0), which is an empty space
- Up is (6, 2), which is an empty space
- Left and right movements are blocked by walls

Since I need to reach the goal at (6, 3), and I need to continue moving upward to get there, moving to (6, 2) is the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal while staying on the rightmost column.

I choose to move to: (6, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 2), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Down is (6, 1), which is an empty space
- Up is (6, 3), which is the goal position
- Left and right movements are blocked by walls

Since I can directly move to the goal position at (6, 3), this is clearly the best and final move.

I choose to move to: (6, 3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape. The path starts at the top, has a horizontal segment, and then turns upward at the rightmost edge to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different configuration:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is formed horizontally along y=1, then turns upward at x=6
- The path is still navigable from P to G
- The overall shape is the same (an "L"), but the position and specific configuration are different from the original
- The maze maintains the same outer dimensions as the original
