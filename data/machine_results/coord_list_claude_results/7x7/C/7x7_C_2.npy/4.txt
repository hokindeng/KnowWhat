You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. I'm currently at position (0, 4)
2. The goal is at position (2, 4)
3. Looking at the available empty spaces and considering valid moves (up, down, left, right):
   - I can move to (1, 4) since it's an empty space and adjacent to my current position
   - Moving down gets me closer to the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current situation:

1. I'm currently at position (1, 4)
2. The goal is at position (2, 4)
3. Looking at the available moves:
   - Moving down to (2, 4) would take me directly to the goal
   - This position is not listed in the walls, so it must be a valid move

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (2, 4), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a "7" shape (looking at the coordinates (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)).

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a "7" shape, but in a slightly different position:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (5, 5)

In this new maze, I've shifted the "7" shape one column to the right and made it longer vertically. The path still forms a "7" shape, with the horizontal part at the top and the vertical part extending downward. The player starts at the top of the "7" and needs to reach the goal at the bottom of the vertical line.
