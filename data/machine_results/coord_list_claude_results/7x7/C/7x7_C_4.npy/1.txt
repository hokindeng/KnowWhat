You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. I'm currently at (2, 1)
2. The goal is at (0, 4)
3. Looking at the available empty spaces and considering valid moves from my current position:
   - I can move up to (1, 1)
   - I can move down to (3, 1)

Since the goal is above and to the right of my current position, and I need to eventually get to a higher row (smaller y-coordinate), moving up to (1, 1) seems like the best choice.

My next move: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 1), let me analyze the possible moves:

1. I can move up to (0, 1)
2. I can move down to (2, 1)

Since the goal is at (0, 4), I need to get to row 0 and then move right. The only way to reach row 0 from my current position is by moving up to (0, 1).

My next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), let me analyze the possible moves:

1. I can move right to (0, 2)
2. I can move down to (1, 1)

Since the goal is at (0, 4), I need to move right to eventually reach it. Moving right along row 0 is the direct path to the goal.

My next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), let me analyze the possible moves:

1. I can move right to (0, 3)
2. I can move left to (0, 1)

Since the goal is at (0, 4), I need to continue moving right to reach it. Moving to (0, 3) gets me one step closer to the goal.

My next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I notice a problem here. Looking at my current position (0, 3) and the goal position (0, 4), I can see that (0, 4) is not listed in the "Empty" spaces, and there appears to be a wall blocking direct access to the goal. Looking at the available empty spaces, I don't see a direct path to reach (0, 4).

This suggests that either:
1. The maze is unsolvable
2. There might be a different path needed that isn't immediately obvious

Let me check my options from (0, 3):
1. I can move left to (0, 2)
2. There are no other valid moves (right is blocked, no empty spaces above or below)

Since I can't reach the goal from here and can only move backwards, this suggests the maze might be unsolvable. Should I try a different approach or is this maze intended to be unsolvable?

My only possible move would be: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at the maze again from my current position at (0, 2), I need to reconsider my strategy. I previously tried going right towards the goal, but that led to a dead end since there's no direct path to (0, 4).

Let me analyze all possible paths:
1. I can move right to (0, 3), but we know that leads nowhere
2. I can move left to (0, 1)
3. Looking at the empty spaces, there's a path going down through (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4) that might provide an alternate route

Since going right didn't work, and we need to find another way to reach the goal, let's try exploring the lower path. I'll start by moving left to (0, 1) so we can then try going down to explore that alternate route.

My next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), let me analyze my options:

1. I can move right to (0, 2), but we know that path leads to a dead end
2. I can move down to (1, 1), which connects to the vertical path that might lead to an alternate route

Since we've already determined that going right doesn't lead to a solution, let's explore the downward path that might give us access to the alternate route through (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4).

My next move: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 1), let me analyze my options:

1. I can move up to (0, 1), but we've already explored that path
2. I can move down to (2, 1), which continues along the vertical path towards (4, 1)

Since going up leads to paths we've already determined don't work, let's continue exploring downward to reach the path that extends through (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4).

My next move: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 1), let me analyze my options:

1. I can move up to (1, 1), but that leads back to paths we've explored
2. I can move down to (3, 1), continuing towards the path that extends through (4, 1)

Let's continue moving down to explore the path through (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4).

My next move: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), let me analyze my options:

1. I can move up to (2, 1), but that leads back to paths we've explored
2. I can move down to (4, 1), which will give us access to the horizontal path (4, 1) through (4, 4)

Let's continue to (4, 1) to explore this new path.

My next move: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), let me analyze my options:

1. I can move up to (3, 1), but that leads back to paths we've explored
2. I can move right to (4, 2), which continues along the horizontal path

Let's move right to (4, 2) to continue exploring this path. This might lead us to a way to reach the goal at (0, 4).

My next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), let me analyze my options:

1. I can move left to (4, 1), but that leads back to paths we've explored
2. I can move right to (4, 3), continuing along the horizontal path

Let's continue moving right to (4, 3) to see if this path leads to a way to reach the goal.

My next move: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), let me analyze my options:

1. I can move left to (4, 2), but that leads back to paths we've explored
2. I can move right to (4, 4), which is the last empty space in this horizontal path

Let's move to (4, 4) to see what options we might have from there.

My next move: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 4), let me analyze the situation:

1. I can only move left to (4, 3), as all other directions are blocked by walls
2. Looking at the overall maze structure and the goal at (0, 4), I now realize that there doesn't seem to be any way to reach the goal position
3. We've explored all possible paths:
   - The direct route along row 0 is blocked
   - The lower path we just explored doesn't provide any access to the goal
   - There are no other unexplored empty spaces that could lead to the goal

I must conclude that this maze is unsolvable - there is no valid path to reach the goal position at (0, 4).

Since I must make a move, I can only move back to (4, 3).

My next move: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.You are correct - after exploring all possible paths in this maze, I can definitively say that this maze is unsolvable. Here's why:

1. The goal is at (0, 4)
2. There is no empty space at (0, 4) or any adjacent spaces that could reach it
3. We've explored all possible paths:
   - The direct route along row 0 ends at (0, 3) with no way to reach (0, 4)
   - The lower path through row 4 is isolated and has no way to connect back to the goal
   - All other spaces are blocked by walls

Since I must make a move, I can only continue moving back along the path we came from.

My next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.As we've confirmed that the maze is unsolvable, we can only continue backtracking along our previous path. From my current position at (4, 2), I'll move back to (4, 1).

My next move: (4, 1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a shape that resembles the letter "T":
- There's a horizontal corridor at the top (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3)
- There's a vertical corridor down the middle (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1)
- There's a horizontal corridor at the bottom (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (4,3) -> (4,4)

Here's a new maze of the same size that forms a "T" shape but is solvable:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 1)

The key differences in this new maze are:
1. The goal is placed at (0,1) instead of (0,4)
2. The player starts at (4,4)
3. There is a valid path from P to G by following the T-shape
4. The basic T-shape of the corridors is preserved

This maze is solvable as the player can move left along the bottom of the T, then up the vertical corridor, and finally right or left along the top horizontal corridor to reach the goal.
