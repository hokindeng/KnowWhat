You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. I'm currently at (2, 1)
2. The goal is at (0, 4)
3. Looking at the available empty spaces and considering valid moves from my current position:
   - I can move up to (1, 1)
   - I can move down to (3, 1)

Since the goal is above and to the right of my current position, and I need to eventually get to a higher row (smaller y-coordinate), moving up to (1, 1) seems like the best choice.

My next move: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 1), let me analyze the possible moves:

1. I can move up to (0, 1)
2. I can move down to (2, 1)

Since the goal is at (0, 4), I need to get to row 0 and then move right. The only way to reach row 0 from my current position is by moving up to (0, 1).

My next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), let me analyze the possible moves:

1. I can move right to (0, 2)
2. I can move down to (1, 1)

Since the goal is at (0, 4), I need to move right to eventually reach it. Moving right along row 0 is the direct path to the goal.

My next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), let me analyze the possible moves:

1. I can move right to (0, 3)
2. I can move left to (0, 1)

Since the goal is at (0, 4), I need to continue moving right to reach it. Moving to (0, 3) gets me one step closer to the goal.

My next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I notice a problem here. Looking at my current position (0, 3) and the goal position (0, 4), I can see that (0, 4) is not listed in the "Empty" spaces, and there appears to be a wall blocking direct access to the goal. Looking at the available empty spaces, I don't see a path that would allow me to reach (0, 4).

This maze appears to be unsolvable - there is no valid path to reach the goal position (0, 4) from my current position using only the available empty spaces.

Should I perhaps backtrack, or is there something I'm missing about the maze configuration?

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), they form an "L" shape.

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with an "L" shaped corridor that provides a valid path from P to G:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (0, 1)

In this new maze, I've created a simple vertical "L" shape that allows for a straightforward path from the player position to the goal. The player can move straight up through the corridor to reach the goal.
