You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at position (5, 4)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3, 5)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I need to reach the goal by moving up, down, left, or right

Looking at the available empty spaces around the current position (5, 4), I can move to:
- (4, 4) which is up from the current position
- (5, 5) which is right from the current position

Since the goal is at (3, 5), moving up towards (4, 4) will get me closer to the goal position.

Therefore, I choose to move to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 4), (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (4, 4), I can move to:
- (3, 4) which is up
- (5, 4) which is down

The goal is at (3, 5), and to reach it, I need to get closer to that position. Moving to (3, 4) will put me in a better position to reach the goal, as from there I can move to (3, 5).

Therefore, I choose to move to (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 4), I can see that the goal is at (3, 5), which is directly to the right of my current position.

Since (3, 5) is the goal position and it's adjacent to my current position, I can move there directly.

Therefore, I choose to move to (3, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)), they form a general "T" shape. The vertical line of the T runs from (5,4) to (3,4), and the horizontal line runs from (3,4) through (3,5) to (3,6), with additional spaces at (5,5) and (5,6).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a T shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (5, 3)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (3, 6)

In this new maze:
- The vertical line of the T runs from (5,3) to (3,3)
- The horizontal line runs from (3,3) through (3,6)
- The T shape is shifted slightly compared to the original but maintains the same basic form
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The maze has the same overall dimensions as the original
