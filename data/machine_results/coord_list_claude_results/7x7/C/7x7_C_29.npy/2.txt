You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given information:
- I'm currently at position (1, 5)
- The goal is at (3, 6)
- I can only move through empty spaces
- I can move up, down, left, or right

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (1, 5):
- Up: (0, 5) is a wall
- Down: (2, 5) is a wall
- Left: (1, 4) is empty
- Right: (1, 6) is empty

Since I need to eventually reach (3, 6), and I can see that (1, 6) is an empty space that will help me progress towards the goal, I'll move right.

My next move is to: (1, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and available moves.

From position (1, 6):
- Up: (0, 6) is a wall
- Down: (2, 6) is a wall
- Left: (1, 5) is empty
- Right: Not possible (outside maze)

I need to get to (3, 6), but I can't move directly there from my current position. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that I need to work my way through the empty spaces at (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), and (3, 5) to eventually reach the goal.

Since I'm currently in a dead end at (1, 6), I need to move back left.

My next move is to: (1, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and available moves.

From position (1, 5):
- Up: (0, 5) is a wall
- Down: (2, 5) is a wall
- Left: (1, 4) is empty
- Right: (1, 6) is empty (but I just came from there and it's a dead end)

I need to get to (3, 6), and I can see that I need to work my way through the empty spaces. Since (1, 6) is a dead end, and I need to eventually reach (3, 4) and (3, 5) to get to the goal, I should move left to (1, 4) to start making progress in that direction.

My next move is to: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and available moves.

From position (1, 4):
- Up: (0, 4) is a wall
- Down: (2, 4) is empty
- Left: (1, 3) is a wall
- Right: (1, 5) is empty (but leads to the dead end we came from)

Looking at the path to the goal (3, 6), I need to go through (2, 4), then (3, 4), and (3, 5) to eventually reach (3, 6). Since (2, 4) is empty and it's in the direction I need to go, I should move down.

My next move is to: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and available moves.

From position (2, 4):
- Up: (1, 4) is empty (but that's where I came from)
- Down: (3, 4) is empty
- Left: (2, 3) is a wall
- Right: (2, 5) is a wall

To reach the goal at (3, 6), I need to go through (3, 4) and then (3, 5). Since (3, 4) is empty and it's in the direction I need to go, I should move down.

My next move is to: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and available moves.

From position (3, 4):
- Up: (2, 4) is empty (but that's where I came from)
- Down: (4, 4) is a wall
- Left: (3, 3) is a wall
- Right: (3, 5) is empty

To reach the goal at (3, 6), I need to go through (3, 5). Since (3, 5) is empty and it's in the direction I need to go, I should move right.

My next move is to: (3, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and available moves.

From position (3, 5):
- Up: (2, 5) is a wall
- Down: (4, 5) is a wall
- Left: (3, 4) is empty (but that's where I came from)
- Right: (3, 6) is the goal

The goal is directly to my right at (3, 6), and this is the final move needed to complete the maze.

My next move is to: (3, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)), they form a general "L" shape, with one end of the L having an additional small segment.

2) Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming an L shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 6)

Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

This maze:
- Is the same size (7x7)
- Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original (fewer empty spaces but maintains the L shape)
- The empty spaces form a clear L shape
- The path from start to goal requires moving down the vertical part of the L and then right to reach the goal
