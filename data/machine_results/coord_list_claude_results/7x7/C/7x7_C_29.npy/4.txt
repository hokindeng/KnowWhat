You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given information:
- I'm currently at position (1, 5)
- The goal is at (3, 6)
- I can only move through empty spaces
- I can move up, down, left, or right

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (1, 5):
- Up: (0, 5) is a wall
- Down: (2, 5) is a wall
- Left: (1, 4) is empty
- Right: (1, 6) is empty

Since I need to eventually reach (3, 6), and I can see that (1, 6) is an empty space that will help me progress towards the goal, I'll move right.

My next move is to: (1, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (1, 6):
- Up: (0, 6) is a wall
- Down: (2, 6) is a wall
- Left: (1, 5) is empty
- Right: Not possible (outside maze)

I need to get to (3, 6), but I can't move directly there because of walls. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that I need to go through (3, 5) to reach the goal, and to get there, I need to go through the path of empty spaces.

Since I can't move forward from (1, 6), I need to backtrack and take the other path. I'll move left to (1, 5).

My next move is to: (1, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (1, 5):
- Up: (0, 5) is a wall
- Down: (2, 5) is a wall
- Left: (1, 4) is empty
- Right: (1, 6) is empty (but I just came from there)

I need to get to (3, 6), and I can see that I need to use the path through the empty spaces. Since going right led to a dead end, I should try going left through (1, 4), which connects to other empty spaces that could lead to the goal.

My next move is to: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (1, 4):
- Up: (0, 4) is a wall
- Down: (2, 4) is empty
- Left: (1, 3) is a wall
- Right: (1, 5) is empty (but I just came from there)

Looking at the path to the goal (3, 6), I can see that I need to go through (2, 4), then (3, 4), and (3, 5) to eventually reach (3, 6). Moving down to (2, 4) is the logical next step in this path.

My next move is to: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (2, 4):
- Up: (1, 4) is empty (but I just came from there)
- Down: (3, 4) is empty
- Left: (2, 3) is a wall
- Right: (2, 5) is a wall

Looking at the path to the goal (3, 6), I need to go through (3, 4) and then (3, 5) to reach (3, 6). Moving down to (3, 4) is the clear next step in this path.

My next move is to: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (3, 4):
- Up: (2, 4) is empty (but I just came from there)
- Down: (4, 4) is a wall
- Left: (3, 3) is a wall
- Right: (3, 5) is empty

Looking at the path to the goal (3, 6), I need to go through (3, 5) to reach (3, 6). Moving right to (3, 5) is the next logical step in this path.

My next move is to: (3, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (3, 5):
- Up: (2, 5) is a wall
- Down: (4, 5) is a wall
- Left: (3, 4) is empty (but I just came from there)
- Right: (3, 6) is the goal

I'm right next to the goal position! Moving right to (3, 6) will complete the maze.

My next move is to: (3, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)), they form a general "L" shape - starting from the top right, going down, and then turning right.

2) Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but in a different orientation (flipped horizontally compared to the original):

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (5, 6)

In this new maze, the "L" shape is formed by a vertical corridor going down from (1, 5) to (5, 5), and then turning right towards the goal at (5, 6). The path is still solvable, and the "L" shape is maintained but mirrored compared to the original maze.
