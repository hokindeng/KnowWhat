You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at position (6, 2)
2. The goal (G) is at position (4, 2)
3. I need to move through empty spaces to reach the goal
4. I can move up, down, left, or right

Looking at the adjacent positions from (6, 2):
- Up: (5, 2) is a wall
- Down: Not possible (outside maze)
- Left: (6, 1) is empty
- Right: (6, 3) is empty

Since I need to eventually reach (4, 2), and I can't move directly up due to walls, I'll need to find a path around. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that moving to (6, 3) will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (6, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current position: (6, 3)
Goal position: (4, 2)

Looking at the adjacent positions from (6, 3):
- Up: (5, 3) is a wall
- Down: Not possible (outside maze)
- Left: (6, 2) is empty
- Right: Not possible (wall at 6, 4)

I need to find a path that will eventually lead me to (4, 2). Looking at the empty spaces available, I can see that I need to work my way up through the available path. Since I can't move up directly from my current position due to a wall, I should move left to (6, 2) and then try to find a path up from there.

I choose to move to coordinate (6, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current position: (6, 2)
Goal position: (4, 2)

Looking at the adjacent positions from (6, 2):
- Up: (5, 2) is a wall
- Down: Not possible (outside maze)
- Left: (6, 1) is empty
- Right: (6, 3) is empty

I've just come from (6, 3), and I can see that going back there won't help me reach the goal. Since I need to eventually get to (4, 2), and I can't move directly up due to walls, I should try moving left to (6, 1) which might provide a path upward.

I choose to move to coordinate (6, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current position: (6, 1)
Goal position: (4, 2)

Looking at the adjacent positions from (6, 1):
- Up: (5, 1) is empty
- Down: Not possible (outside maze)
- Left: (6, 0) is a wall
- Right: (6, 2) is empty

I've just come from (6, 2), and going back there won't help. I can now move up to (5, 1), which will get me closer to the goal position. This seems like the best move as it's bringing me closer to the goal's vertical position.

I choose to move to coordinate (5, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current position: (5, 1)
Goal position: (4, 2)

Looking at the adjacent positions from (5, 1):
- Up: (4, 1) is empty
- Down: (6, 1) is empty (where I came from)
- Left: (5, 0) is a wall
- Right: (5, 2) is a wall

I've just come from (6, 1), and going back won't help. Moving up to (4, 1) will get me closer to the goal position, and from there I should be able to move right to reach (4, 2).

I choose to move to coordinate (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current position: (4, 1)
Goal position: (4, 2)

Looking at the adjacent positions from (4, 1):
- Up: (3, 1) is a wall
- Down: (5, 1) is empty (where I came from)
- Left: (4, 0) is a wall
- Right: (4, 2) is the goal!

Perfect! I can now move right to reach the goal position.

I choose to move to coordinate (4, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)), they form a rough "U" shape, with one leg of the U being longer than the other.

2) Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming a U shape, but with the U rotated 90 degrees clockwise compared to the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 1)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a U shape that's been rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The player starts at the top of one leg of the U and needs to reach the goal at the bottom of the other leg. The path is still continuous and solvable, maintaining the U shape while being distinct from the original maze.
