You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
- I'm currently at position (6, 2)
- The goal is at (4, 2)
- I can only move through empty spaces
- I need to move up towards the goal

Looking at the available empty spaces and considering my current position (6, 2), I can move to (6, 3) or (6, 1).
Since the goal is at (4, 2), and I need to eventually reach that position, I should move to (6, 3) as it will allow me to progress towards the goal.

My next move should be to: (6, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (6, 3) and analyzing the available moves:

- I can move to (6, 2) which I just came from
- I can move to (4, 3) through the empty spaces

Since my goal is at (4, 2), and I need to get closer to it, I should move to (4, 3) as it brings me closer to the goal position.

My next move should be to: (4, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces and path in the original maze, they form a "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)

Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form a "Z" shape but in a different orientation
- The path from P to G is valid and can be traversed through empty spaces
- The maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions
- The arrangement is different from the original while maintaining the "Z" shape pattern
