You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From what I can understand:
1. I'm currently at position (6, 3)
2. The goal is at (0, 5)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I can move up, down, left, or right

Looking at my current position (6, 3), I need to check which adjacent spaces are empty.
- Up: (5, 3) is a wall
- Down: (7, 3) would be out of bounds
- Left: (6, 2) is an empty space
- Right: (6, 4) is an empty space

Since I need to eventually reach (0, 5), and I'm currently blocked by walls above me, I should try to find a path around these walls. Moving to (6, 2) would help me get closer to a potential path around the walls.

I choose to move to coordinate (6, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

At position (6, 2), my options are:
- Up: (5, 2) is a wall
- Down: (7, 2) would be out of bounds
- Left: (6, 1) is an empty space
- Right: (6, 3) is an empty space

Looking at the overall maze structure, I need to get to (0, 5). There appears to be a series of walls blocking direct access, so I need to find a path around them. Moving to (6, 1) would allow me to potentially move upward through the empty corridor I can see at coordinate column 1.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (6, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

At position (6, 1), my options are:
- Up: (5, 1) is an empty space
- Down: (7, 1) would be out of bounds
- Left: (6, 0) is a wall
- Right: (6, 2) is an empty space

I need to reach (0, 5), and I can see there's a clear path upward through column 1. Moving up through this corridor will help me get closer to the goal and give me more options for navigation once I'm past the wall section.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (5, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

At position (5, 1), my options are:
- Up: (4, 1) is an empty space
- Down: (6, 1) is an empty space
- Left: (5, 0) is a wall
- Right: (5, 2) is a wall

I need to reach (0, 5), and I'm currently in the corridor moving upward through column 1. Continuing up this path is clearly the best option as it will get me closer to where I need to be while staying on a valid path.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

At position (4, 1), my options are:
- Up: (3, 1) is an empty space
- Down: (5, 1) is an empty space
- Left: (4, 0) is a wall
- Right: (4, 2) is a wall

I need to reach (0, 5), and I'm continuing along the corridor in column 1. The best option is to keep moving upward through this passage as it's the clear path toward the top of the maze where I'll need to find a way to reach the goal at (0, 5).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

At position (3, 1), my options are:
- Up: (2, 1) is an empty space
- Down: (4, 1) is an empty space
- Left: (3, 0) is a wall
- Right: (3, 2) is a wall

I need to reach (0, 5), and I'm still moving through the corridor in column 1. Continuing upward is still the best option as it brings me closer to the top of the maze where I'll need to find a path to the goal at (0, 5).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

At position (2, 1), my options are:
- Up: (1, 1) is an empty space
- Down: (3, 1) is an empty space
- Left: (2, 0) is a wall
- Right: (2, 2) is a wall

I need to reach (0, 5), and I'm continuing along the corridor in column 1. Moving upward is still the best choice as it brings me closer to the top of the maze where I'll need to find a way to reach the goal at (0, 5).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

At position (1, 1), my options are:
- Up: (0, 1) is an empty space
- Down: (2, 1) is an empty space
- Left: (1, 0) is a wall
- Right: (1, 2) is a wall

I need to reach (0, 5), and I'm now near the top of the maze. Moving to (0, 1) will put me in position to traverse along the top row where there are empty spaces at (0, 2), (0, 3), and (0, 4) that will help me reach the goal at (0, 5).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

At position (0, 1), my options are:
- Up/Down: not possible as these would be out of bounds or walls
- Left: (0, 0) is a wall
- Right: (0, 2) is an empty space

I need to reach (0, 5), and I'm now at the top row of the maze. I can see there's a path along the top row through (0, 2), (0, 3), and (0, 4) that will help me get closer to the goal at (0, 5).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

At position (0, 2), my options are:
- Up/Down: not possible as these would be out of bounds or walls
- Left: (0, 1) is an empty space
- Right: (0, 3) is an empty space

I need to reach (0, 5), and I'm continuing along the top row of the maze. Moving right through (0, 3) and then (0, 4) will get me closer to the goal at (0, 5).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

I need to reach (0, 5), and I'm continuing along the top row of the maze. Moving right to (0, 4) will get me closer to the goal at (0, 5).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

- Left: (0, 3) is an empty space
- Right: (0, 5) is the goal position

I'm right next to the goal position at (0, 5)! I can move directly to it.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (0, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape - there's a vertical corridor along column 1 and a horizontal corridor along row 0, meeting at coordinate (0,1).

Here's a new maze of the same size that also forms an "L" shape, but with the corridors shifted:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 2)

Empty: (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)

Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (0, 3)

In this new maze, the "L" shape is formed by:
- A vertical corridor along column 1
- A horizontal corridor along row 0
But the vertical part starts lower and the horizontal part is shifted right compared to the original maze. The path from P to G is still valid through these corridors.
