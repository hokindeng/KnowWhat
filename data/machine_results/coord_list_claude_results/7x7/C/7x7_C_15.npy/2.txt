You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From what I can understand:
1. I'm currently at position (6, 3)
2. The goal is at (0, 5)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I can move up, down, left, or right

Looking at my current position (6, 3), I need to check which adjacent spaces are empty.
- Up: (5, 3) is a wall
- Down: (7, 3) would be out of bounds
- Left: (6, 2) is an empty space
- Right: (6, 4) is an empty space

Since I need to eventually reach (0, 5), and I'm currently blocked by walls above me, I should try to find a path around these walls. Moving to (6, 2) would help me get closer to a potential path around the walls.

I choose to move to coordinate (6, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (6, 2), I can check the adjacent spaces:
- Up: (5, 2) is a wall
- Down: (7, 2) would be out of bounds
- Left: (6, 1) is an empty space
- Right: (6, 3) is an empty space

Since I need to reach (0, 5) and I'm currently blocked by walls above me, I need to find a path around these walls. Moving to (6, 1) would help me get to the corridor on the left side of the maze, which appears to be a path that could lead me toward the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (6, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (6, 1), I can check the adjacent spaces:
- Up: (5, 1) is an empty space
- Down: (7, 1) would be out of bounds
- Left: (6, 0) is a wall
- Right: (6, 2) is an empty space

Since I need to reach (0, 5), and there's a clear path upward through the empty spaces at (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), etc., I should take this path as it will help me get closer to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (5, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (5, 1), I can check the adjacent spaces:
- Up: (4, 1) is an empty space
- Down: (6, 1) is an empty space
- Left: (5, 0) is a wall
- Right: (5, 2) is a wall

Since I need to reach (0, 5), and I'm in a vertical corridor, continuing upward through (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), etc., is the clear choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (4, 1), I can check the adjacent spaces:
- Up: (3, 1) is an empty space
- Down: (5, 1) is an empty space
- Left: (4, 0) is a wall
- Right: (4, 2) is a wall

Continuing with the same logic as before, I need to keep moving upward through this corridor to get closer to the goal at (0, 5). The path upward through (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), etc., remains clear.

I choose to move to coordinate (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (3, 1), I can check the adjacent spaces:
- Up: (2, 1) is an empty space
- Down: (4, 1) is an empty space
- Left: (3, 0) is a wall
- Right: (3, 2) is a wall

Continuing with the same strategy, I need to keep moving upward through this corridor to get closer to the goal at (0, 5). The path upward through (2,1), (1,1), (0,1) remains clear.

I choose to move to coordinate (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (2, 1), I can check the adjacent spaces:
- Up: (1, 1) is an empty space
- Down: (3, 1) is an empty space
- Left: (2, 0) is a wall
- Right: (2, 2) is a wall

Continuing with the same strategy, I need to keep moving upward through this corridor to get closer to the goal at (0, 5). Moving up to (1,1) will get me closer to being able to move horizontally toward the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (1, 1), I can check the adjacent spaces:
- Up: (0, 1) is an empty space
- Down: (2, 1) is an empty space
- Left: (1, 0) is a wall
- Right: (1, 2) is a wall

I need to reach (0, 5), and moving up to (0, 1) will put me in a position where I can then move right through the empty spaces at row 0 to get closer to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (0, 1), I can check the adjacent spaces:
- Up/Down: Not possible as we're at the top row
- Left: (0, 0) is a wall
- Right: (0, 2) is an empty space

Now that I'm at the top row, I need to move right to get closer to the goal at (0, 5). There appears to be a path of empty spaces leading to the right through (0, 2), (0, 3), and (0, 4).

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

From position (0, 2), I can check the adjacent spaces:
- Up/Down: Not possible as we're at the top row
- Left: (0, 1) is an empty space
- Right: (0, 3) is an empty space

Continuing along the top row towards the goal at (0, 5), I should keep moving right through the empty spaces.

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

From position (0, 3), I can check the adjacent spaces:
- Up/Down: Not possible as we're at the top row
- Left: (0, 2) is an empty space
- Right: (0, 4) is an empty space

Continuing along the top row towards the goal at (0, 5), I should keep moving right through the empty spaces.

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

From position (0, 4), I can check the adjacent spaces:
- Up/Down: Not possible as we're at the top row
- Left: (0, 3) is an empty space
- Right: (0, 5) is the goal position

Since (0, 5) is the goal position and it's directly adjacent to my current position, I should move there.

I choose to move to coordinate (0, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "T" shape. The vertical line of the T runs from (6,1) to (0,1), and the horizontal line runs along the top row from (0,1) to (0,6).

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size that also forms a T shape, but with the vertical line shifted to the right and the horizontal line at the bottom:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Empty: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (0, 6)

In this new maze:
- The vertical line of the T runs from (6,5) to (0,5)
- The horizontal line runs along row 6 from (6,1) to (6,6)
- The player starts at (6,1) and needs to reach the goal at (0,6)
- The path follows the bottom horizontal line to reach the vertical line, then goes up to reach the goal
- The T shape is maintained but rotated and positioned differently from the original maze
