You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From what I can understand:
1. I'm at position (6, 3)
2. The goal is at (0, 5)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I can move up, down, left, or right

Looking at my current position (6, 3), I need to check which adjacent spaces are empty.
- Up: (5, 3) is a wall
- Down: (7, 3) would be out of bounds
- Left: (6, 2) is an empty space
- Right: (6, 4) is an empty space

Since I need to eventually reach (0, 5), and I'm currently blocked by walls above me, I should try to find a path around these walls. Moving to (6, 2) would help me progress towards finding a path around the walls.

I choose to move to (6, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

At position (6, 2), my options are:
- Up: (5, 2) is a wall
- Down: (7, 2) would be out of bounds
- Left: (6, 1) is an empty space
- Right: (6, 3) is an empty space

Since I need to reach (0, 5) and I'm currently blocked by walls above me, I need to find a path around these walls. Moving to (6, 1) would help me get closer to a path that could lead up towards the goal.

I choose to move to (6, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

At position (6, 1), my options are:
- Up: (5, 1) is an empty space
- Down: (7, 1) would be out of bounds
- Left: (6, 0) is a wall
- Right: (6, 2) is an empty space

Since I need to reach (0, 5), and I can now move upward through the empty corridor at column 1, I should take that path. Moving up to (5, 1) will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to (5, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

- Up: (4, 1) is an empty space
- Down: (6, 1) is an empty space
- Left: (5, 0) is a wall
- Right: (5, 2) is a wall

Since I need to reach (0, 5), I should continue moving up through the empty corridor at column 1. Moving to (4, 1) will bring me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

- Down: (5, 1) is an empty space
- Left: (4, 0) is a wall
- Right: (4, 2) is a wall

Continuing with the same strategy, I should keep moving up through the empty corridor at column 1, as this will bring me closer to the goal. Moving to (3, 1) is the best choice.

I choose to move to (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Continuing with the same strategy, I should keep moving up through the empty corridor at column 1, as this will bring me closer to the goal. Moving to (1, 1) is the best choice.

I choose to move to (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

- Right: (1, 2) is a wall

Continuing with the same strategy, I should move up to (0, 1), which will finally get me to the top row. From there, I'll be able to move right towards the goal position at (0, 5).

I choose to move to (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Since I can see that (0, 5) is the goal position and it's directly to my right, I should move there.

I choose to move to (0, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "T" shape. The vertical line of the T runs along column 1 from row 6 to row 0, and the horizontal line runs along row 0 from column 1 to column 6 (with a gap at column 5).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a T shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (0, 5)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (0, 2)

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions as the original
- Forms a T shape with its corridors
- Has a different start and goal position
- Maintains a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is not identical to the original maze but preserves the T-shape pattern

The main vertical corridor still runs along column 1, and the horizontal corridor runs along row 0, forming the characteristic T shape.
