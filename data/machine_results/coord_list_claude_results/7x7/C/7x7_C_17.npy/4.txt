You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. I'm currently at position (2, 4)
2. The goal is at (4, 2)
3. Looking at the empty spaces available: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
4. From my current position at (2, 4), I need to move towards the goal at (4, 2)

Looking at the available moves from my current position (2, 4), I can move to:
- (2, 3) which is an empty space

This is the logical first step as it moves me closer to the goal position.

My next move should be to: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current situation:

1. I'm currently at position (2, 3)
2. The goal is at (4, 2)
3. Looking at the empty spaces available: (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

From my current position (2, 3), I can move to:
- (2, 2) which is an empty space
- (2, 4) which would be going backwards
- (3, 2) which is an empty space

Since I need to get to (4, 2), and (3, 2) is closer to the goal and available, this is the best move.

My next move should be to: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current situation:

1. I'm currently at position (3, 2)
2. The goal is at (4, 2)
3. Looking at the empty spaces available: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)

From my current position (3, 2), I can move to:
- (2, 2) which would be going backwards
- (4, 3) which is an empty space

Since I need to get to (4, 2), and (4, 3) is the only forward option available, I should move there. Even though it's not directly to the goal, it will help me progress towards it.

My next move should be to: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current situation:

1. I'm currently at position (4, 3)
2. The goal is at (4, 2)
3. Looking at the empty spaces available: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 4)

From my current position (4, 3), I can move to:
- (4, 4) which is an empty space
- (4, 2) which is the goal position

Since I can move directly to the goal position (4, 2), that's clearly the best move.

My next move should be to: (4, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), with a horizontal line at the top, a diagonal line in the middle, and a horizontal line at the bottom.

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different placement while maintaining the same general structure:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 4)

In this new maze, I've maintained the Z-shape but shifted it slightly to the left and made the path a bit wider in some places. The player starts at the top of the Z and needs to reach the goal at the bottom of the Z, following the same zigzag pattern as in the original maze.
