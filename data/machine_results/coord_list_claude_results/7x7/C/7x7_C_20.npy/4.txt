You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm starting at position (0,0)
2. The goal is at (4,3)
3. There's a path going down the left side and then right
4. I need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (0,0), I can:
1. Move right to (0,1)
2. Move down to (1,0)

Since the overall goal is at (4,3), and there's a clear path going down the left side, the best move would be to go down to (1,0).

My next move: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1,0), I can see that:
1. I can move up to (0,0)
2. I can move down to (2,0)

Since I just came from (0,0), and I need to make progress towards the goal at (4,3), I should continue moving down along the left side of the maze where there's a clear path.

My next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,0), I can:
1. Move up to (1,0)
2. Move down to (3,0)

Since I'm trying to reach the goal at (4,3), and I just came from (1,0), I should continue moving down along the left side of the maze. This will get me closer to the goal's row position.

My next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,0), I can:
1. Move up to (2,0)
2. Move down to (4,0)

Since I'm trying to reach the goal at (4,3) and I just came from (2,0), I should continue moving down to (4,0). From there, I'll be able to start moving right towards the goal's column position.

My next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,0), I can:
1. Move up to (3,0)
2. Move right to (4,1)

Since I just came from (3,0) and I need to reach the goal at (4,3), I should start moving right along row 4. The goal is three spaces to the right of my current position, and I can see there's a path leading that way.

My next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,1), I can:
1. Move left to (4,0)
2. Move right to (4,2)

Since I just came from (4,0) and I need to reach the goal at (4,3), I should continue moving right along row 4. The goal is two spaces to the right of my current position.

My next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position at (4,2), I notice that I cannot directly move to (4,3) as it's not listed in the empty spaces. This means that position (4,3), despite being the goal, is actually blocked. Looking at the available empty spaces, I can only see:
1. Move left to (4,1)
2. Move right to (4,4)

This appears to be a dead end, as there's no valid path to reach the goal at (4,3). The goal position seems to be unreachable in this maze configuration.

Should I move back to (4,1) to try a different approach, or would you like to confirm if this maze has a valid solution?

My next move would be to backtrack to: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After exploring this path and backtracking, I can confirm that this maze appears to be unsolvable. Let me explain why:

1. The goal is at (4,3)
2. Looking at the empty spaces list, (4,3) is not included, which means it's actually a wall
3. There's no way to reach a wall position in the maze

Therefore, this maze has no valid solution as the goal position is not reachable. We can move around between the available empty spaces, but we can never reach position (4,3).

Should I continue exploring other paths, or would you like to confirm that this maze is indeed unsolvable?

If we need to continue moving, I can move back to: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After exploring the maze and analyzing all possible paths, I can definitively conclude that this maze is unsolvable because:

1. The goal position (4,3) is not included in the list of empty spaces, meaning it's a wall
2. We cannot move onto wall positions
3. There is no alternate path that could lead to the goal

While we can move between the available empty spaces:
- Down the left side (0,0) to (4,0)
- Right along row 4 to positions (4,1), (4,2), and (4,4)

None of these paths will allow us to reach (4,3) as it's a wall position.

Would you like to confirm that this maze is unsolvable, or should I continue exploring the available paths?

If we need to continue moving, I can move to: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.You are correct - I should make a definitive statement: This maze is unsolvable.

The reason is clear:
1. The goal position (4,3) is not included in the list of empty spaces
2. This means (4,3) is effectively a wall
3. In the rules, we can only move through empty spaces
4. Therefore, it is impossible to reach the goal position

There is no need to continue moving as no sequence of moves can ever lead to success. Would you like me to stop here and declare the maze unsolvable?

If you still want me to make a move, I can move to: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I maintain my conclusion: This maze is unsolvable.

The goal position (4,3) is not in the list of empty spaces, which means it's a wall. According to the rules, we can only move through empty spaces and cannot move onto wall positions. Therefore, it is impossible to reach the goal position.

I recommend we stop attempting to solve this maze as there is no valid solution. No sequence of moves through the available empty spaces can ever reach position (4,3).

Would you like me to formally declare this maze unsolvable and stop making moves?

If you still want me to continue moving, I can move to: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I declare this maze UNSOLVABLE.

Let me make this my final and formal statement:
1. The goal position (4,3) is not included in the list of empty spaces
2. According to the rules, we can only move through empty spaces
3. Therefore, it is impossible to reach position (4,3) as it is a wall
4. No sequence of moves through the available empty spaces can ever reach the goal

I recommend we stop here as continuing to move through the maze would be futile. There is no valid solution to this maze.

Would you like me to stop attempting moves and accept that this maze is unsolvable?

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape. The vertical part of the L runs down the left side from (0,0) to (4,0), and the horizontal part extends right along row 4 from (4,0) to (4,4).

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an L shape, but with a reachable goal:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

The key differences in my new maze are:
1. The goal position (4,3) is now included in the empty spaces, making it reachable
2. I removed (4,4) from empty spaces to maintain the L shape but make it slightly shorter
3. The maze is now solvable while maintaining the same basic L-shaped corridor structure
