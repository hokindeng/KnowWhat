You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm starting at position (0,0)
2. The goal is at (4,3)
3. There's a path of empty spaces I can move through
4. I need to avoid all wall coordinates

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (0,0), I can:
- Move right to (1,0)
- Move down is not possible (not in empty spaces)
- Move left is not possible (would be off the grid)
- Move up is not possible (would be off the grid)

Since I need to eventually reach (4,3), and there's a path of empty spaces leading to the right, the logical first move would be to move right to (1,0).

My next move: (1,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1,0), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Move right to (2,0) is possible (it's in empty spaces)
- Move left to (0,0) is possible but would be backtracking
- Move up is not possible (would be off the grid)
- Move down is not possible (wall at (1,1))

Since I need to reach (4,3) and there's a path of empty spaces continuing to the right, I should continue moving right.

My next move: (2,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,0), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Move right to (3,0) is possible (it's in empty spaces)
- Move left to (1,0) is possible but would be backtracking
- Move up is not possible (would be off the grid)
- Move down is not possible (wall at (2,1))

Since I need to reach (4,3) and there's a path of empty spaces continuing to the right, I should continue moving right.

My next move: (3,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,0), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Move right to (4,0) is possible (it's in empty spaces)
- Move left to (2,0) is possible but would be backtracking
- Move up is not possible (would be off the grid)
- Move down is not possible (wall at (3,1))

Since I need to reach (4,3) and there's a path of empty spaces continuing to the right that will eventually let me move upward towards the goal, I should continue moving right.

My next move: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,0), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Move right is not possible (wall at (5,0))
- Move left to (3,0) would be backtracking
- Move up is not possible (would be off the grid)
- Move down to (4,1) is possible (it's in empty spaces)

Since I need to reach (4,3) and I can't move right anymore, I need to start moving up through the available path. The only valid move is to go down to (4,1).

My next move: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,1), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Move right is not possible (wall at (5,1))
- Move left is not possible (wall at (3,1))
- Move up to (4,0) would be backtracking
- Move down to (4,2) is possible (it's in empty spaces)

Since I need to reach (4,3) and the only valid move is downward, which is also in the direction of our goal, I should move to (4,2).

My next move: (4,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,2), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Move right is not possible (wall at (5,2))
- Move left is not possible (wall at (3,2))
- Move up to (4,1) would be backtracking
- Move down to (4,3) is possible (this is the goal position!)

I can move directly to the goal position at (4,3).

My next move: (4,3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form an "L" shape. The path starts at the top left, moves right horizontally, and then turns upward vertically on the right side to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an "L" shape but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (5, 3), (6, 3)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (6, 3)

In this new maze:
- The horizontal part of the "L" runs along the bottom row (y=0)
- The vertical part of the "L" runs up the right side (x=6)
- The player starts at (0,0) and needs to reach the goal at (6,3)
- The path still forms an "L" shape but is rotated 90 degrees compared to the original
- The walls are rearranged but still maintain the "L" shaped corridor
