You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current player position (P) is at (1, 4)
2. Goal (G) is at (3, 3)
3. Looking at the empty spaces and possible moves:
   - From (1, 4), I can move to (1, 3) since it's an empty space
   - This will get me closer to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to (1, 3).

My next move: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current player position (P) is at (1, 3)
2. Goal (G) is at (3, 3)
3. Looking at the empty spaces and possible moves:
   - From (1, 3), I can move to:
     * (1, 2) which is an empty space
     * (1, 4) which is an empty space
   - Moving to (1, 2) will allow me to continue towards the goal through the available path

Therefore, I choose to move to (1, 2).

My next move: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current player position (P) is at (1, 2)
2. Goal (G) is at (3, 3)
3. Looking at the empty spaces and possible moves:
   - From (1, 2), I can move to:
     * (1, 3) which is an empty space
     * (2, 2) which is an empty space
   - Moving to (2, 2) will get me closer to the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to (2, 2).

My next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current player position (P) is at (2, 2)
2. Goal (G) is at (3, 3)
3. Looking at the empty spaces and possible moves:
   - From (2, 2), I can move to:
     * (3, 2) which is an empty space
   - Moving to (3, 2) is the only available move and will get me closer to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to (3, 2).

My next move: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position:

1. Current player position (P) is at (3, 2)
2. Goal (G) is at (3, 3)
3. Looking at the empty spaces and possible moves:
   - From (3, 2), I can move to:
     * (3, 3) which is the goal position!

Since the goal position is directly accessible from my current position, I'll move there.

Therefore, I choose to move to (3, 3).

My next move: (3, 3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a general "Z" shape (or reversed "Z" shape, depending on orientation).

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with different positioning:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

In this new maze:
- The path still forms a "Z" shape
- The start and goal positions are different from the original
- The maze is the same size (7x7)
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The shape is still recognizable as a "Z" but is positioned differently in the grid
