You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal position (4, 0) from the current player position (6, 3).

Looking at the available empty spaces and the current position, I can see that I need to move upward and leftward to reach the goal. The path needs to go through the empty spaces while avoiding walls.

From the current position (6, 3), I should move left to (6, 2) as my first move, as this will bring me closer to the goal while staying on a valid path.

My next move is: (6, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape, with one corridor running vertically (from coordinates 3,0 to 3,3) and another running horizontally (from 6,0 to 6,3), connected by the empty spaces that allowed movement from one corridor to the other.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size that maintains an "L" shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

In this new maze, the "L" shape is rotated compared to the original, with the vertical corridor running along x=1 and the horizontal corridor running along y=1. The path is still navigable from P to G through empty spaces, and the overall "L" shape is maintained while being distinct from the original maze.
