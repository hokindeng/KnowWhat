You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (5, 3)
2. The goal is at (0, 3)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (5, 3):
- Up: (4, 2) is an empty space
- Down: (5, 4) is an empty space
- Left: (5, 2) is an empty space
- Right: This would be (5, 4)

To make progress toward the goal (which is above me), I should try to move upward when possible. Since (4, 2) is an empty space and it gets me closer to the goal, I'll move to that position.

My next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (4, 2) and analyzing the available moves:

- Up: (3, 2) is an empty space
- Down: (5, 2) is an empty space
- Left: (4, 1) is a wall
- Right: (4, 3) is a wall

Since my goal is at (0, 3) and I need to continue moving upward to reach it, the best move is to go up to (3, 2), which is an empty space and gets me closer to the goal.

My next move is to: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (3, 2) and analyzing the available moves:

- Up: (2, 2) is an empty space
- Down: (4, 2) is an empty space
- Left: (3, 1) is a wall
- Right: (3, 3) is a wall

Since my goal is at (0, 3) and I need to continue moving upward to reach it, the best move is to go up to (2, 2), which is an empty space and gets me closer to the goal.

My next move is to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (2, 2) and analyzing the available moves:

- Up: (1, 2) is an empty space
- Down: (3, 2) is an empty space
- Left: (2, 1) is a wall
- Right: (2, 3) is a wall

Since my goal is at (0, 3) and I need to continue moving upward to reach it, the best move is to go up to (1, 2), which is an empty space and gets me closer to the goal.

My next move is to: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (1, 2) and analyzing the available moves:

- Up: (0, 2) is an empty space
- Down: (2, 2) is an empty space
- Left: (1, 1) is a wall
- Right: (1, 3) is a wall

Since my goal is at (0, 3), I need to get to the top row and then move right. The only available move that gets me closer to the goal is up to (0, 2).

My next move is to: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (0, 2) and analyzing the available moves:

- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: (1, 2) is an empty space
- Left: (0, 1) is a wall
- Right: (0, 3) is the goal

Since I'm at (0, 2) and the goal is at (0, 3), I can move right to reach the goal directly.

My next move is to: (0, 3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "T" shape. The vertical line of the T runs from (5,3) up through (0,2), and the horizontal line spans across the top from (0,4) to (0,6), with another horizontal span at (5,4) to (5,6).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size that also forms a T shape, but with the T rotated 90 degrees clockwise:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)
Empty: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)
Player position: (5,0)
Goal: (6,3)

In this new maze, the vertical line of the T runs horizontally from (5,0) to (5,6), and the horizontal line of the T runs vertically from (3,3) to (6,3). The path from P to G is still valid and follows the T shape, but the orientation is different from the original maze.
