You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at position (5, 3)
2. The goal (G) is at position (0, 3)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (5, 3):
- Up: Not possible (wall at 4, 3)
- Down: Not possible (wall at 6, 3)
- Left: (5, 2) is empty
- Right: (5, 4) is empty

To reach the goal at (0, 3), I need to move towards the left side of the maze. The position (5, 2) is empty and would bring me closer to a potential path to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to (5, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up: (4, 2) is empty
- Down: Not possible (wall at 6, 2)
- Left: Not possible (wall at 5, 1)
- Right: (5, 3) is empty

To reach the goal at (0, 3), I need to continue moving upward through the empty corridor at x=2. Moving up to (4, 2) will bring me closer to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to (4, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- Right: Not possible (wall at 4, 3)

To reach the goal at (0, 3), I need to continue moving upward through the empty corridor at x=2. Moving up to (3, 2) will bring me closer to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to (3, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (3, 2)

- Down: (4, 2) is empty
- Left: Not possible (wall at 3, 1)
- Right: Not possible (wall at 3, 3)

To reach the goal at (0, 3), I need to continue moving upward through the empty corridor at x=2. Moving up to (2, 2) will bring me closer to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to (2, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up: (1, 2) is empty
- Down: (3, 2) is empty
- Left: Not possible (wall at 2, 1)
- Right: Not possible (wall at 2, 3)

To reach the goal at (0, 3), I need to continue moving upward through the empty corridor at x=2. Moving up to (1, 2) will bring me closer to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to (1, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

To reach the goal at (0, 3), I need to move up to (0, 2) first, which will then allow me to move right to the goal at (0, 3).

Therefore, I choose to move to (0, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

- Right: (0, 3) is the goal

I can now move right to reach the goal position at (0, 3).

Therefore, I choose to move to (0, 3).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 3)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "T" shape. The vertical line of the T runs from (5,2) up to (0,2), and the horizontal line spans from (0,2) through (0,6) at the top.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size that also forms a T shape, but with the T rotated 90 degrees clockwise:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)

Empty: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3)

Player position: (5,0)
Goal: (0,3)

In this new maze, the vertical line of the T runs along row 5 from (5,0) to (5,6), and the horizontal line runs up column 3 from (5,3) to (0,3). The path from P to G is still valid and follows the T shape, but the orientation is different from the original maze.
