You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 6)
2. The goal is at (0, 1)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces while avoiding walls

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 6), I can see that:
- I can move to (2, 6) which is an empty space
- This would be a step in the right direction as we need to eventually move towards (0, 1)

Therefore, I choose to move to (2, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 6), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (2, 6), I can:
- Move to (1, 6) which is an empty space
- This continues our progress towards the goal by moving closer to the left side where we need to be

Therefore, I choose to move to (1, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 6), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (1, 6), I can:
- Move to (0, 6) which is an empty space
- This continues our progress towards the goal by moving to the leftmost column where we'll need to traverse down to reach (0, 1)

Therefore, I choose to move to (0, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 6), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (0, 6), I can:
- Move to (0, 5) which is an empty space
- This continues our progress towards the goal by moving down the leftmost column towards (0, 1)

Therefore, I choose to move to (0, 5).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 5), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (0, 5), I can:
- Move to (0, 4) which is an empty space
- This continues our progress towards the goal by moving down the leftmost column towards (0, 1)

Therefore, I choose to move to (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (0, 4), I can:
- Move to (0, 3) which is an empty space
- This continues our progress towards the goal by moving down the leftmost column towards (0, 1)

Therefore, I choose to move to (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 1), I can now make the final move to reach the goal at (0, 1).

Therefore, I choose to move to (0, 1).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "T" shape. The vertical line of the T runs along the leftmost column (from position 1 to 6), and the horizontal line of the T spans across the maze at position 1 from the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size that maintains a T-shaped corridor pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Player position: (0, 6)
Goal: (6, 0)

In this new maze, the T shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise compared to the original. The vertical line of the T runs horizontally across the middle (positions 1-2), and the horizontal line of the T runs vertically through position 5. The path from P to G is still valid through the empty spaces.
