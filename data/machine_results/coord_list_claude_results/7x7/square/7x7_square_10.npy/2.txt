You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 6)
2. The goal is at (0, 1)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 6):
- I can move to (2, 6) which is an empty space
- This would be a step in the right direction as I need to eventually move towards (0, 1)

Therefore, I choose to move to (2, 6).

My next move coordinates are: (2, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (2, 6), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 1).

Analyzing the empty spaces adjacent to my current position:
- I can move to (1, 6) which is an empty space
- Moving to (1, 6) would get me closer to the goal position

This is the logical next step as I need to keep moving towards the left side of the maze where the goal is located.

Therefore, I choose to move to (1, 6).

My next move coordinates are: (1, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (1, 6), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 1).

Analyzing the empty spaces adjacent to my current position:
- I can move to (0, 6) which is an empty space
- This would allow me to move along the top row of the maze towards the goal

Moving to (0, 6) is the logical next step as it gets me to the top row, from where I can move left towards the goal position.

Therefore, I choose to move to (0, 6).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (0, 6)
Goal: (0, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (0, 6), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 1).

Analyzing the empty spaces adjacent to my current position:
- I can move to (0, 5) which is an empty space
- This continues my path along the top row towards the goal

Moving to (0, 5) is the logical next step as it gets me closer to the goal position by moving left along the top row.

Therefore, I choose to move to (0, 5).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 5)

- This continues my path along the top row towards the goal

Moving to (0, 4) is the logical next step as it gets me closer to the goal position by moving left along the top row.

Therefore, I choose to move to (0, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "T" shape. The vertical line of the T runs along the right side of the maze (through coordinates (5,1) to (5,6)), and the horizontal line runs along the top of the maze (through coordinates (0,2) to (0,6)), with a connecting path to reach the goal at (0,1).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size that maintains a "T" shape pattern but with a slightly different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (0, 1)

In this new maze:
- The vertical line of the T is now on the left side
- The horizontal line runs along the top
- The path is still navigable from P to G
- The overall T shape is maintained but mirrored compared to the original
