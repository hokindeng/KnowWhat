You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Empty: (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information:
1. I'm currently at position (4, 6)
2. The goal is at (6, 5)
3. Looking at the available empty spaces and my current position, I can move to:
   - Up: (4, 5)

Since I need to eventually reach (6, 5), and I can only move through empty spaces, moving up to (4, 5) is the logical first step as it's the only valid move from my current position.

My next move: (4, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Empty: (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), I can analyze the available moves:
1. Up: (4, 4) - This is an empty space
2. Down: (4, 6) - This is where I came from
3. Right: (5, 5) - This is a wall
4. Left: Not possible (wall)

Since I need to eventually reach (6, 5) and I can't move directly right due to a wall, I should move up to (4, 4). This will allow me to potentially reach the goal through a different path.

My next move: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Empty: (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 4), I can analyze the available moves:
1. Up: Not possible (wall)
2. Down: (4, 5) - This is where I came from
3. Right: (5, 4) - This is an empty space
4. Left: Not possible (wall)

Since I need to reach (6, 5) and I can move right to (5, 4), this is the logical choice as it brings me closer to the goal position.

My next move: (5, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Empty: (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 4), I can analyze the available moves:
1. Up: Not possible (wall)
2. Down: Not possible (wall at 5, 5)
3. Right: (6, 4) - This is an empty space
4. Left: (4, 4) - This is where I came from

Since I need to reach (6, 5) and I can move right to (6, 4), this is the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal position. From there, I should be able to move up to reach the goal.

My next move: (6, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Empty: (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 4), I can analyze the available moves:
1. Up: (6, 5) - This is the goal position!
2. Down: (6, 6) - This is an empty space
3. Right: Not possible
4. Left: (5, 4) - This is where I came from

Since I can move directly to the goal position at (6, 5), this is clearly the best move.

My next move: (6, 5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "Z" shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise, so it appears horizontal).

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a similar "Z" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (6, 6)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a "Z" shape, but it's positioned differently in the grid. The path starts at (3,1) and needs to traverse right, then diagonally down, and finally right again to reach the goal at (6,6). This maintains the same basic "Z" shape concept while being a different maze configuration.
