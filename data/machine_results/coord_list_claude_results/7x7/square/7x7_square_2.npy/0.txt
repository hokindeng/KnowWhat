You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at (4, 6)
2. The goal (G) is at (4, 3)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around the current position (4, 6), I can move to:
- (3, 6) - moving up
- (5, 6) - moving down

Since the goal is at (4, 3), which is to the left of the current position, I should try to find a path that will eventually allow me to move left. Looking at the layout, moving up to (3, 6) seems to be the better choice as it will allow me to eventually reach the goal through the empty spaces.

Therefore, I choose to move to (3, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (4, 6), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 6), I can see that I need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 3).

Looking at the available moves from (3, 6), I can:
- Move to (2, 6) - moving up
- Move to (3, 3) - moving left
- Move to (4, 6) - moving down

Since the goal is at (4, 3), I need to get closer to that position. Moving left through (3, 3) will get me closer to the goal position.

Therefore, I choose to move to (3, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "U" shape (or horseshoe shape). The empty spaces create two vertical corridors connected by a horizontal corridor at the bottom, forming a U-like pattern.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a U shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (5, 6)

In this new maze:
- The U shape is maintained but slightly modified
- The vertical corridors are still present on both sides
- The horizontal connecting corridor is still at the bottom
- The player and goal positions are placed at opposite ends of the U
- The path from P to G is valid and follows the U shape
- The overall structure is similar but not identical to the original maze
