You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information:
- I'm currently at position (1, 2)
- The goal is at (3, 2)
- I can only move through empty spaces
- I can move up, down, left, or right

Looking at the adjacent spaces to my current position (1, 2):
- Up: (0, 2) is a wall
- Down: (2, 2) is an empty space
- Left: (1, 1) is a wall
- Right: (1, 3) is an empty space

I can either move right to (1, 3) or down to (2, 2). Since the goal is at (3, 2), moving down to (2, 2) would bring me closer to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (2, 2):
- Up: (1, 2) is an empty space
- Down: (3, 2) is the goal
- Left: (2, 1) is a wall
- Right: (2, 3) is a wall

Since I can see that the goal position (3, 2) is directly below my current position, and it's a valid move, I'll move there.

Therefore, I choose to move to: (3, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), with a horizontal corridor at the top (from (1,2) to (1,4)), a diagonal section through the middle, and a horizontal corridor at the bottom (from (3,2) to (3,4)).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different coordinates:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)

Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 5)

This new maze maintains the "Z" shape but:
- The top horizontal segment is from (1,2) to (1,3)
- The diagonal section goes from top-left to bottom-right through (2,3) and (2,4)
- The bottom horizontal segment is from (3,3) to (3,5)
- The start and end positions create a valid path through the Z-shaped corridor
