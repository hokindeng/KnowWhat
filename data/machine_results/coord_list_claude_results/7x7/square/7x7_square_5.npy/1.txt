You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 3)
2. The goal is at (5, 5)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 3):
- I can see that I need to move towards the right and down to reach the goal at (5, 5)
- Moving right is blocked by walls
- Moving down is blocked by walls
- Moving left is possible as (2, 2) is an empty space
- Moving up is not possible due to walls

Since I need to eventually get to (5, 5), and I'm currently blocked from moving directly towards it, I should first move to (2, 2) to find an alternate path.

My next move will be to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), let me analyze the available moves:

1. I can move:
- Left to (2, 1)
- Right to (2, 3)
- Down to (3, 2) is blocked by a wall
- Up is blocked by a wall

Looking at the overall path to the goal (5, 5), I need to eventually get to the right side of the maze. Since moving down is blocked by walls at my current position, I should try to find a path around these walls.

Moving to (2, 1) would allow me to potentially go down through the left side of the maze where there appears to be a path.

Therefore, I will move to: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

1. I can move:
- Right to (2, 2)
- Down to (3, 1)
- Up and Left are blocked by walls

Looking at the path to the goal (5, 5), I need to find a way around the walls in the middle of the maze. I can see that moving down to (3, 1) would allow me to access the path that runs along the left side of the maze, which should eventually connect to the goal.

Therefore, I will move to: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

1. I can move:
- Up to (2, 1)
- Down to (4, 1)
- Right and Left are blocked by walls

Looking at the path to the goal (5, 5), I need to continue moving down along the left side of the maze to eventually reach a path that will lead to the goal. Moving down to (4, 1) will get me closer to that path.

Therefore, I will move to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)

1. I can move:
- Up to (3, 1)
- Down to (5, 1)
- Right and Left are blocked by walls

Looking at the path to the goal (5, 5), I should continue moving down along the left side of the maze. Moving to (5, 1) will get me closer to the bottom path that appears to connect to the goal.

Therefore, I will move to: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)

1. I can move:
- Up to (4, 1)
- Down to (6, 1)
- Right and Left are blocked by walls

Looking at the path to the goal (5, 5), I need to use the bottom path to reach it. Moving to (6, 1) will allow me to access the horizontal path at the bottom of the maze that should lead towards the goal.

Therefore, I will move to: (6, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)

The goal is at (5, 5), and I can now move directly to it by going up. This is the final move needed to reach the goal.

Therefore, I will move to: (5, 5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts from the top, goes down along the left side, and then moves right along the bottom before going up again to reach the goal.

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with a "U" shaped path that meets all the criteria:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (2, 5)

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a clear U-shaped path
- Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the U shape
- The player starts at the top of one arm of the U and needs to reach the goal at the top of the other arm
