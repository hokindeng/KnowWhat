You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 3)
2. The goal is at (5, 5)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 3):
- I can see that I need to move towards the right and down to reach the goal at (5, 5)
- Moving right is blocked by walls
- Moving down is blocked by walls
- Moving left is possible as (2, 2) is an empty space
- Moving up is not possible due to walls

Since I need to eventually get to (5, 5), and I'm currently blocked from moving directly towards it, I should first move to (2, 2) to find an alternate path.

My next move will be to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), let me analyze the available moves:

1. I can move:
- Left to (2, 1)
- Right to (2, 3)
- Down to (3, 1) is possible as it's an empty space
- Up is blocked by walls

Since my goal is at (5, 5), I need to find a path that will eventually let me move down and right. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that moving down to (3, 1) will give me access to a path that can lead to the goal through the bottom of the maze.

Therefore, I choose to move down to: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

1. I can move:
- Up to (2, 1)
- Down to (4, 1)
- Left and right are blocked by walls

Looking at the overall maze and the goal at (5, 5), I need to continue moving downward to access the path that will lead me to the goal. Moving up would just take me back to where I came from.

Therefore, I choose to move down to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

1. I can move:
- Up to (3, 1)
- Down to (5, 1)
- Left and right are blocked by walls

Since my goal is at (5, 5), and I need to eventually move right to reach it, I should continue moving down to access the bottom path. Moving up would just take me back where I came from.

Therefore, I choose to move down to: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

1. I can move:
- Up to (4, 1)
- Down to (6, 1)
- Left and right are blocked by walls

Since my goal is at (5, 5), I need to find a way to move right. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that moving down to (6, 1) will give me access to a path that runs along the bottom of the maze, which I can use to move right and then back up to reach the goal at (5, 5).

Therefore, I choose to move down to: (6, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

1. I can move:
- Up to (5, 1)
- Right to (6, 2)
- Left is blocked by a wall

Since my goal is at (5, 5), and I'm now at the bottom path, I should move right along this path which will eventually allow me to reach the goal. Moving up would just take me back where I came from.

Therefore, I choose to move right to: (6, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)

Therefore, I choose to move right to: (6, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)

Now I can finally reach the goal! Since my goal is at (5, 5) and I'm directly below it, I should move up.

Therefore, I choose to move up to: (5, 5)

This should complete the maze as this is the goal position!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path goes down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side.

2) Here's a new 7x7 maze with a U-shaped corridor pattern, but with slightly different positioning:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 5)

In this new maze:
- The U-shape is maintained but slightly wider
- The player starts at the top of one vertical arm of the U
- The goal is at the top of the other vertical arm
- The path still requires going down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side
- The maze is the same 7x7 size as the original
- The path is valid and reachable through empty spaces
