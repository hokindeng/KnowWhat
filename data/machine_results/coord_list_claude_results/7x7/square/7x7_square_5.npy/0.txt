You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 3)
2. The goal is at (5, 5)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 3):
- I can see that I need to move towards the right and down to reach the goal at (5, 5)
- Moving right is blocked by walls
- Moving down is blocked by walls
- Moving left is possible as (2, 2) is an empty space
- Moving up is not possible due to walls

Since I need to eventually get to (5, 5), and I'm currently blocked from moving directly towards it, I should first move to (2, 2) to find an alternate path.

My next move will be to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), let me analyze the available moves:

1. I can move left to (2, 1)
2. I can move right to (2, 3)
3. I can move down to (3, 2) is blocked by a wall
4. I can move up is blocked by a wall

Looking at the overall maze and the goal position (5, 5), I need to find a path that will eventually lead me down and to the right. Moving right again would put me back where I started, and moving down is blocked. Therefore, moving left to (2, 1) seems to be the best option as it might give me access to a path that goes around the walls.

My next move will be to: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

1. I can move right to (2, 2)
2. I can move down to (3, 1)
3. Moving left is blocked by a wall
4. Moving up is blocked by a wall

Looking at the goal position (5, 5), I need to find a path that leads down and to the right. Moving right would take me back where I came from, but moving down to (3, 1) opens up a new path that might help me progress towards the goal.

My next move will be to: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

1. I can move up to (2, 1)
2. I can move down to (4, 1)
3. Moving right is blocked by a wall
4. Moving left is blocked by a wall

Looking at the goal position (5, 5), I need to continue moving downward and eventually find a way to move right. Moving up would take me back where I came from, so moving down to (4, 1) seems like the best option to progress towards the goal.

My next move will be to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)

1. I can move up to (4, 1)
2. I can move down to (6, 1)
3. Moving right is blocked by a wall
4. Moving left is blocked by a wall

Looking at the goal position (5, 5), I need to find a way to move right. Since I'm already at the correct row (5), but blocked by walls to the right, I need to find an alternate path. Moving up would take me back where I came from, so moving down to (6, 1) seems like the best option as it might give me access to a path that goes around the walls to reach (5, 5).

4. Moving left is blocked by a wall

Looking at the goal position (5, 5), I need to find a way to get there. Moving up would take me back where I came from, but moving right to (6, 2) will allow me to traverse along the bottom row and eventually find a path up to the goal position.

My next move will be to: (6, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts from the top, goes down one side, across the bottom, and then up the other side to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a "U" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 5)

In this new maze:
- The path still forms a "U" shape
- The player starts at the top left of the U
- The goal is at the top right of the U
- The path goes down the left side, across the bottom, and up the right side
- The maze is different from the original but maintains the same general shape and size
