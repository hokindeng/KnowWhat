You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (5, 1)
2. The goal is at (2, 0)
3. I need to move through empty spaces to reach the goal
4. I can only move up, down, left, or right

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (5, 1):
- Up: (4, 1) is a wall
- Down: (6, 1) is a wall
- Left: (5, 0) is empty
- Right: (5, 2) is empty

To get closer to the goal (2, 0), I should move towards the left since that will bring me closer to the goal position.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (5, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

I'm currently at (5, 0) and need to reach (2, 0).
Looking at the empty spaces around my current position:
- Up: (4, 0) is empty
- Down: (6, 0) is a wall
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (5, 1) is empty

Since the goal is at (2, 0), and I need to move upward to reach it, the best move is to go up to (4, 0).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

I'm currently at (4, 0) and need to reach (2, 0).
Looking at the empty spaces around my current position:
- Up: (3, 0) is empty
- Down: (5, 0) is empty
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (4, 1) is a wall

Since the goal is at (2, 0), and I need to continue moving upward to reach it, the best move is to go up to (3, 0).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

I'm currently at (3, 0) and need to reach (2, 0).
Looking at the empty spaces around my current position:
- Up: (2, 0) is the goal
- Down: (4, 0) is empty
- Left: not possible (outside maze)
- Right: (3, 1) is a wall

Since the goal is at (2, 0) and it's directly above my current position, the best move is to go up to (2, 0).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape, with one corridor running vertically along the left edge and another corridor running horizontally near the top.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shape pattern but with slightly different positioning:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (6, 0)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the "L" runs along the left side (column 0)
- The horizontal part of the "L" runs along the bottom (rows 5-6)
- The player can move from P to G through the empty spaces
- The overall shape is still recognizable as an "L" but with different proportions
- The walls and paths are arranged differently from the original while maintaining the same basic concept
