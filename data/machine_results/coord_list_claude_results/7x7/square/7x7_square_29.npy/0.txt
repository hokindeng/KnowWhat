You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze:
- The walls form boundaries and obstacles
- There are empty spaces where I can move
- I'm currently at position (2, 4)
- The goal is at position (0, 2)
- I can only move up, down, left, or right through empty spaces

Looking at the available paths:
1. From current position (2, 4), I can move:
   - Left to (2, 3)
   - Up to (1, 4)

Since the goal is at (0, 2), I need to move towards the left and up. The best next move would be to move left to position (2, 3), which will help me get closer to the goal.

My next move: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 2).

Looking at the available moves from (2, 3):
1. I can move:
   - Left to (2, 2)
   - Right to (2, 4)

Since the goal is at (0, 2), I should move left to (2, 2) as this brings me closer to the goal position.

My next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 2).

Looking at the available moves from (2, 2):
1. I can move:
   - Up to (1, 2)
   - Right to (2, 3)

Since the goal is at (0, 2) and I need to move upward to reach it, I should move up to (1, 2).

My next move: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 2), I need to reach the goal at (0, 2).

Looking at the available moves from (1, 2):
1. I can move:
   - Up to (0, 2) [the goal]
   - Down to (2, 2)
   - Right to (1, 3) [but this is a wall]

Since I can move directly to the goal position, I should move up to (0, 2).

My next move: (0, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a general "Z" shape. Starting from the goal at (0, 2), it moves right to (0, 3)-(0, 4), then diagonally down through (1, 4) to (2, 3)-(2, 4), and finally moves left through (2, 2) to complete the "Z" pattern.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different orientation:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (4, 4)

In this new maze, the "Z" shape is rotated and slightly modified, but still maintains the characteristic three-segment pattern of a "Z". The path goes from top to bottom, with a diagonal middle section, creating a valid path from P to G through empty spaces.
