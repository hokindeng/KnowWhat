You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given information, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 4)
2. The goal is at (0, 2)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I need to avoid walls

Looking at the empty spaces: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)

From my current position (2, 4), I can move to:
- Left to (2, 3)
- Up to (1, 4)

To reach the goal (0, 2), I need to move towards the left and up. The best next move would be to move left to (2, 3), which will help me get closer to the goal.

My next move: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (2, 3), I can see that:

Available moves:
- Left to (2, 2)
- Right to (2, 4) (but this would be going backwards)

The goal is at (0, 2), and I need to work my way towards it. Moving left to (2, 2) will get me closer to the goal position.

My next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (2, 2), I can see that:

Available moves:
- Up to (1, 2)
- Right to (2, 3) (but this would be going backwards)

The goal is at (0, 2), and I need to continue moving upward to reach it. Moving up to (1, 2) is the clear choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

My next move: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (1, 2), I can see that:

Available moves:
- Up to (0, 2) - this is the goal position!
- Down to (2, 2) (but this would be going backwards)

The goal is at (0, 2), which is directly above my current position. This is the final move needed to reach the goal.

My next move: (0, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a general "Z" shape (or reversed "Z" shape, depending on orientation). The path starts at the top, moves horizontally, then diagonally down, and finally horizontally again at the bottom.

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with a "Z" shaped path, but positioned differently than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)

Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (5, 1)

This new maze maintains a "Z" shape in its path but is rotated compared to the original. The path starts at the top right, moves left horizontally, then diagonally down to the bottom, and finally moves horizontally to the left at the bottom. The size remains 7x7, and there is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces.
