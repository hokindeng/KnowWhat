You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 5), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can see that:
1. I'm currently at position (4, 2)
2. The goal is at (6, 2)
3. Looking at the empty spaces around my current position:
   - Up: (3, 2) is empty
   - Down: (5, 2) is empty
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: blocked by wall

Since I need to reach (6, 2), and I can see that (5, 2) is an empty space that would bring me closer to the goal, I'll move down.

My next move is to: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves:

1. I'm currently at (5, 2)
2. The goal is at (6, 2)
3. Looking at the empty spaces around my current position:
   - Up: (4, 2) is empty
   - Down: (6, 2) is the goal
   - Left: blocked by wall
   - Right: blocked by wall

Since I can move directly to the goal position from here, I'll move down.

My next move is to: (6, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "Z" shape (or reversed "Z" shape, depending on orientation). The path starts from the top horizontal line, follows a diagonal line downward, and ends with another horizontal line at the bottom.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different arrangement than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 6)

In this new maze:
- The top horizontal line of the Z is formed by (1,1) to (3,1)
- The diagonal line runs from (3,2) to (5,4)
- The bottom horizontal line runs from (5,4) to (6,6)
- The player starts at the beginning of the top line
- The goal is at the end of the bottom line
- All empty spaces are connected to form a continuous path
- The overall Z shape is maintained but positioned differently than in the original maze
