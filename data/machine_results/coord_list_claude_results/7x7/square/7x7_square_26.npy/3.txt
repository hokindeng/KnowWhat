You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (6, 4)
2. The goal is at (3, 1)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (6, 4):
- Up: (5, 4) is an empty space

Since I need to move towards the goal which is at (3, 1), and I can only move through empty spaces, moving up to (5, 4) is the logical first step as it brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (5, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (5, 4):
- Up: (4, 4) is an empty space
- Left: (5, 1) is an empty space, but not directly adjacent

Moving up to (4, 4) continues to bring me closer to the goal position, as I'll need to eventually move towards the left to reach (3, 1).

I choose to move to: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 4):
- Up: (3, 4) is an empty space
- Left: (4, 1) is an empty space, but not directly adjacent

Moving up to (3, 4) is the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal, and I can then move left through the empty spaces to reach (3, 1).

I choose to move to: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 4):
- Left: (3, 3) is an empty space

Since I'm already at the correct row (3) for the goal position, I need to move left to reach (3, 1). The path is clear through empty spaces (3, 3) → (3, 2) → (3, 1).

I choose to move to: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 3):
- Left: (3, 2) is an empty space

I'll continue moving left along row 3 to reach the goal. After this move, I should be able to reach the goal with one more move.

I choose to move to: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), I need to make my final move to reach the goal at (3, 1).

Looking at the goal position (3, 1), I can see it's directly to my left and it's the final destination.

I choose to move to: (3, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape, with one corridor running vertically and another horizontally, meeting at a right angle.

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)

Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

In this new maze, I've created an "L" shape that:
- Has a vertical corridor along column 1
- The empty spaces form a clear path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the "L" shape characteristic
- Fits within the same 7x7 grid
- Allows for valid movement between P and G

The main difference is that this L-shape is more compact and runs along the left side of the maze, while the original L-shape was more spread out and occupied the right side of the maze.
