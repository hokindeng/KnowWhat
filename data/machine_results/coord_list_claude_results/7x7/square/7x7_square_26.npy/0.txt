You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (6, 4)
2. The goal is at (3, 1)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (6, 4):
- Up: (5, 4) is an empty space

Since I need to move towards the goal which is at (3, 1), and I can only move through empty spaces, moving up to (5, 4) is the logical first step as it brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (5, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (5, 4):
- Up: (4, 4) is an empty space
- Left: (5, 1) is an empty space, but not directly adjacent

Moving up to (4, 4) continues to bring me closer to the goal position, and it's a valid empty space.

I choose to move to: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 4):
- Up: (3, 4) is an empty space
- Left: (4, 1) is an empty space, but not directly adjacent

Moving up to (3, 4) is the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal and allows me to continue navigating through the available empty spaces.

I choose to move to: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 4):
- Left: (3, 3) is an empty space

Since the goal is to the left of my current position, and (3, 3) is an empty space, moving left is the logical choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 3):
- Left: (3, 2) is an empty space

Since the goal is to the left of my current position, and (3, 2) is an empty space, moving left continues to bring me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 2):
- Down: (4, 1) is an empty space, though not directly adjacent
- Right: (3, 3) is an empty space
- Left: (3, 1) is the goal position

Since (3, 1) is directly to the left and it's our goal position, I can move there directly.

I choose to move to: (3, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape. The path starts from the bottom right, goes up, and then turns left to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different arrangement than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

In this new maze:
- The "L" shape is rotated compared to the original
- The path goes up vertically and then makes a right turn to reach the goal
- The size remains 7x7
- The path from P to G is valid and reachable through empty spaces
- The overall "L" shape of the corridor is maintained but in a different orientation
