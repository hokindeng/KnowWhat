You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. I'm currently at position (1, 4)
2. The goal is at (0, 6)
3. Looking at the available empty spaces and considering my position, I can see that I need to move towards the goal by going through the empty spaces.

From my current position (1, 4), I can move to:
- (0, 4) going up
- (2, 4) going down

Since the goal is at (0, 6), I should try to move upward and then right. Therefore, I'll move to (0, 4).

My next move: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (0, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 4), I can move to:
- (0, 5) going right
- (1, 4) going down

Since the goal is at (0, 6), I need to continue moving right to reach it. Therefore, I'll move to (0, 5).

My next move: (0, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (0, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 5), I cannot move directly to (0, 6) because there's no empty space connecting them directly. Looking at the available empty spaces, I need to take a longer path:

I can see that I need to:
1. Go down and around through the available empty spaces
2. Then come back up to reach (0, 6)

Looking at my immediate options from (0, 5), I need to go down to connect with the other empty spaces. Therefore, I'll move to (1, 6).

My next move: (1, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (0, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 6), I can move to:
- (0, 6) going up, which is the goal
- (2, 6) going down

Since (0, 6) is the goal position, I'll move there.

My next move: (0, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a "U" shape (or horseshoe shape). The path starts at the top, goes down one side, and comes back up the other side.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a U shape, but positioned differently:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (1, 6)

In this new maze, the U shape is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise compared to the original. The path starts from the bottom, goes up one side, and then across and down the other side to reach the goal. The overall shape is still clearly a U, but in a different orientation.
