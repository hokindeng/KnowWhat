You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. I'm currently at position (1, 4)
2. The goal is at (0, 6)
3. Looking at the available empty spaces and considering my position, I can see that I need to move towards the goal by going through the empty spaces.

From my current position (1, 4), I can move to:
- (0, 4) going up
- (2, 4) going down

Since the goal is at (0, 6), I should try to move upward and then right to reach it. Therefore, I'll move to (0, 4).

My next move: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (0, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 4), I can move to:
- (0, 5) going right
- (1, 4) going down

Since the goal is at (0, 6), I need to continue moving right to reach it. Therefore, I'll move to (0, 5).

My next move: (0, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (0, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 5), I cannot move directly to (0, 6) because there's no direct path. Looking at the empty spaces, I need to find an alternate route.

I can see that I need to:
1. Go down and around through the available empty spaces
2. Then come back up to reach (0, 6)

Looking at the available moves from (0, 5), I can move to:
- (0, 4) going left
- (1, 6) going through the empty spaces

Since going left would be moving away from our goal, I'll move to (1, 6) which will help me reach the goal.

My next move: (1, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (0, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 6), I can now move up to reach the goal at (0, 6).

My next move: (0, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a general "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation). The path starts at the vertical part of the L, then turns right to reach the goal.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming an L shape, but in a different position:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 5)
Goal: (1, 5)

In this new maze:
- The L shape is rotated 90 degrees compared to the original
- The vertical part of the L is longer
- The player starts at the bottom of the L and needs to move up to reach the goal
- The path is still valid and solvable
- The maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions as the original
