You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information, I can see that:
1. I'm currently at position (4, 0)
2. The goal is at (6, 2)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. Looking at the empty spaces coordinates, I can see a path is possible through (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), and eventually to (6,2)

For my next move, I should move to (4, 1), which is:
- Adjacent to my current position
- Listed as an empty space
- Moving in the right direction towards the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 2).

Looking at the available empty spaces and analyzing my options:
1. I can move to (4, 2), which is:
- Adjacent to my current position
- Listed as an empty space
- Continuing in the right direction towards the goal

This is the logical next step as it will bring me closer to the goal position at (6, 2).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 2).

Looking at the available empty spaces and analyzing my options:
1. I can move to (5, 2), which is:
- Adjacent to my current position
- Listed as an empty space
- Moving directly towards the goal position

This is the optimal next move as it brings me one step closer to the goal at (6, 2).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (5, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), I need to make my final move to reach the goal at (6, 2).

Looking at my options:
1. I can move to (6, 2), which is:
- Adjacent to my current position
- The goal position

This is the final move needed to complete the maze.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (6, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2)), they form a general "U" shape, with one vertical line connected to a horizontal line at the bottom, and another vertical line on the right.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a "U" shape, but with the U rotated 90 degrees clockwise:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,0), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,0), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,0), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,0), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)
Empty: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)
Player position: (0,1)
Goal: (6,1)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a horizontal U shape, with the player starting at the top left and needing to traverse through the U-shaped corridor to reach the goal at the other end. The path is still continuous and solvable, maintaining the U shape but in a different orientation than the original maze.
