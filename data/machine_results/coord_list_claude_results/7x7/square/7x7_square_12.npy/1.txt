You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The maze has walls forming a border on the left side and a vertical line near the middle
2. The player (P) is at position (1, 5)
3. The goal (G) is at position (6, 0)
4. I need to find a path through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the available empty spaces around the current position (1, 5), I can move to:
- (1, 4) going up
- (2, 5) going right

Since the goal is at (6, 0), which is in the bottom-left part of the maze, I should try to move towards that direction. The best next move would be to go up to position (1, 4).

My next move: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 4), I can see that:
1. I can move to:
   - (1, 3) going up
   - (1, 5) going down
   - (2, 4) is a wall

Since I need to reach the goal at (6, 0), I should continue moving upward to eventually reach the bottom row. Therefore, I'll move to (1, 3).

My next move: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 3), I can:
1. Move to:
   - (1, 2) going up
   - (1, 4) going down
   - (2, 3) is a wall

Continuing with the strategy of moving towards the goal at (6, 0), I should keep moving upward. Therefore, I'll move to (1, 2).

My next move: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)

   - (1, 0) going up
   - (1, 2) going down
   - (2, 1) is a wall

Continuing with the strategy of moving towards the goal at (6, 0), I should keep moving upward to (1, 0), which will put me in the bottom row where I can then move right towards the goal.

My next move: (1, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "U" shape. The path starts from the top-right, goes down along the right side, moves left along the bottom, and then goes up along the left side.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size that maintains a "U" shape pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 5)

In this new maze:
- The U-shape is mirrored compared to the original
- The path runs from top-left, down the left side, across the bottom, and up the right side
- The walls are shifted but maintain the U-shape corridor
- The start and end positions are placed to ensure the U-shaped path must be followed
- The maze is the same size (7x7) as the original
