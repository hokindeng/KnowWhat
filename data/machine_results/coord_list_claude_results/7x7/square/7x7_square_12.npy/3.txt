You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The maze has walls forming a boundary on the left side and bottom right
2. There's a large block of walls in the middle
3. I need to get from (1,5) to (6,0)
4. I can only move through empty spaces

Looking at the available paths:
- I'm currently at (1,5)
- I can see there's a path going up through the empty spaces
- I need to eventually reach the bottom left to get to (6,0)

The best next move would be to move to (2,5), which is directly below my current position. This will help me progress towards the goal while staying on valid empty spaces.

My next move: (2, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,5), I can see that:
1. I need to continue moving towards (6,0)
2. There's a path that continues downward through the empty spaces
3. I'll eventually need to go left to reach the goal

The logical next move is to continue down to (3,5), which is an empty space and keeps me on the path towards the goal.

My next move: (3, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,5), I'll continue with the same strategy:
1. I need to reach (6,0)
2. There's a clear path continuing downward
3. I'll eventually need to go left along the bottom to reach the goal

The logical next move is to continue down to (4,5), which is an empty space and maintains my progress towards the goal.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts at the top, goes down one side, and then across the bottom to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size that maintains a "U" shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (0, 6)
Goal: (6, 0)

In this new maze:
- The U-shape is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise compared to the original
- The path goes from left to right instead of top to bottom
- The player starts at the top of one arm of the U and needs to traverse down, across, and up the other arm to reach the goal
- The walls and empty spaces are rearranged while maintaining the same general U-shape pattern
- The maze is still solvable with a clear path from P to G
