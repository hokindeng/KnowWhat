You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The maze has walls forming a boundary on the left side and bottom right
2. There's a large block of walls in the middle
3. I need to get from position (1,5) to (6,0)
4. I can only move through empty spaces

Looking at the available paths:
- I'm currently at (1,5)
- I can see there's a path going up through the empty spaces
- I need to eventually reach the bottom left to get to (6,0)

The best next move would be to move to (2,5), which is an empty space adjacent to my current position. This will help me progress towards the goal by moving along the right side of the maze before I can move down and left.

My next move: (2, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,5), I can continue moving along the right side of the maze. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that (3,5) is available and will help me progress towards the goal.

Moving to (3,5) will keep me on the path while getting closer to the bottom where I'll need to turn left to reach the goal at (6,0).

My next move: (3, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (6, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing with the same strategy, I'll keep moving along the right side of the maze. From my current position at (3,5), I can see that (4,5) is an empty space and will continue my progress towards the goal.

My next move: (4, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)

Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (6, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts at the top, goes down along the right side, and then moves left along the bottom to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size that maintains a "U" shaped path but with slightly different wall placements:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 0)

In this new maze:
- The path still forms a "U" shape
- The vertical part of the "U" is shifted one column to the left compared to the original
- The player starts at the top of one vertical line
- The goal remains at the same position
- The path requires the same basic movement pattern: go down, then right, then up to reach the goal
- The walls are rearranged but maintain the overall structure
