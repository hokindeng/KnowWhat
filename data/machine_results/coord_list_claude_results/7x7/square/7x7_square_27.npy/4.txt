You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From what I understand:
1. I'm currently at position (4, 6)
2. The goal is at (1, 0)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I can move up, down, left, or right

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (4, 6):
- Up: (3, 6) is empty
- Down: (5, 6) is empty

Since I need to eventually reach (1, 0), which is on the left side of the maze, I should try to move towards that direction. The best path appears to be going up along the right side and then moving left along the top row.

Therefore, I choose to move up to position (3, 6).

My next move coordinates are: (3, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Continuing with my strategy to reach (1, 0):

From my current position at (3, 6), I can see:
- Up: (2, 6) is empty
- Down: (4, 6) is empty (but that's where I came from)

Following the same logic as before, I need to continue moving up along the right side of the maze before I can traverse left to reach the goal. Moving up is the clear choice here.

Therefore, I choose to move up to position (2, 6).

My next move coordinates are: (2, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 6), I can see:
- Up: (1, 6) is empty
- Down: (3, 6) is empty (but that's where I came from)

Continuing with the strategy of moving up along the right side and then left to reach the goal at (1, 0), I should keep moving up.

Therefore, I choose to move up to position (1, 6).

My next move coordinates are: (1, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 6), I can see:
- Up: (0, 6) is empty
- Down: (2, 6) is empty (but that's where I came from)

Since I need to reach (1, 0), and I can't move directly left due to walls, I need to go up to (0, 6) first. From there, I'll be able to move left along the top row until I can get to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move up to position (0, 6).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (0, 6)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 6), I can see:
- Left: (0, 5) is empty
- Down: (1, 6) is empty (but that's where I came from)

Now that I'm at the top row, I can move left along the empty path (0, 6) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 0), and then eventually down to the goal at (1, 0).

The next step in this path is to move left.

Therefore, I choose to move left to position (0, 5).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)

Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 5), I can see:
- Left: (0, 4) is empty
- Right: (0, 6) is empty (but that's where I came from)

Continuing with my plan to move left along the top row until I can reach the goal, I should keep moving left.

Therefore, I choose to move left to position (0, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)

Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 4), I can see:
- Left: (0, 3) is empty
- Right: (0, 5) is empty (but that's where I came from)

Continuing with my plan to move left along the top row until I can reach the goal, I should keep moving left.

Therefore, I choose to move left to position (0, 3).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), I can see:
- Left: (0, 2) is empty
- Right: (0, 4) is empty (but that's where I came from)

Continuing with my plan to move left along the top row until I can reach the goal, I should keep moving left.

Therefore, I choose to move left to position (0, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "U" shape. The path goes up the right side, across the top, and down the left side of the maze.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a U-shape pattern, but with the corridors shifted slightly:

Walls: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (1, 1)

This new maze:
- Maintains the U-shape corridor pattern
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original (corridors are shifted one column to the right)
- Has the same overall dimensions
- Preserves the recognizable U-shape of the empty spaces

The solution path would follow the same general strategy: up the right side, across the top, and down the left side to reach the goal.
