You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From what I understand:
1. I'm currently at position (4, 6)
2. The goal is at (1, 0)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I can move up, down, left, or right

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (4, 6):
- Up: (3, 6) is empty
- Down: (5, 6) is empty

Since I need to eventually reach (1, 0), which is on the left side of the maze, I should try to move towards that direction. The best next move would be to move up to position (3, 6), as this brings me closer to the goal.

My next move: (3, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

I'm currently at (3, 6) and need to reach (1, 0).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 6):
- Up: (2, 6) is empty
- Down: (4, 6) is empty (but that's where I came from)
- Left: (3, 0) is empty (but there are walls in between)

Since I need to get to (1, 0), and I can see that I'll need to use the path along the top or bottom of the maze, moving up towards (2, 6) is the best option as it brings me closer to the goal.

My next move: (2, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

I'm currently at (2, 6) and need to reach (1, 0).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 6):
- Up: (1, 6) is empty
- Down: (3, 6) is empty (but that's where I came from)
- Left: (2, 0) is empty (but there are walls in between)

Since I need to get to (1, 0), and I can see that moving up to (1, 6) will allow me to eventually use the top row of the maze (0, x) to reach the goal, this is the best move.

My next move: (1, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

I'm currently at (1, 6) and need to reach (1, 0).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (1, 6):
- Up: (0, 6) is empty
- Down: (2, 6) is empty (but that's where I came from)

Since I need to get to (1, 0), and there are walls blocking a direct path, I'll need to use the top row of the maze to get there. Moving up to (0, 6) will allow me to traverse along the top row to eventually reach (1, 0).

My next move: (0, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

I'm currently at (0, 6) and need to reach (1, 0).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (0, 6):
- Left: (0, 5) is empty
- Down: (1, 6) is empty (but that's where I came from)

Since I need to get to (1, 0), I should move left along the top row until I can get to the goal. Moving to (0, 5) is the next logical step in this path.

My next move: (0, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)

Since I need to get to (1, 0), I should continue moving left along the top row. Moving to (0, 4) is the next logical step in this path.

My next move: (0, 4)

Since I need to get to (1, 0), I should continue moving left along the top row. Moving to (0, 1) is the next logical step in this path.

My next move: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (0, 0):
- Right: (0, 1) is empty
- Down: (1, 0) is empty (this is the goal!)

Since (1, 0) is the goal and it's directly below my current position, I should move there.

My next move: (1, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "U" shape. The empty spaces create a path that goes down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side of the maze.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a U-shape pattern, but with the U rotated 90 degrees clockwise:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (6, 3)

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form a U shape rotated 90 degrees clockwise
- The path runs along the top row, down the right side, and along the bottom row
- The walls form a solid block in the center
- There is a valid path from the player position to the goal
- The overall dimensions remain 7x7
- The shape is clearly recognizable as a U, just in a different orientation
