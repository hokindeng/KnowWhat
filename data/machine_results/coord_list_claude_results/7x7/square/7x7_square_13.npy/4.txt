You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at (3, 4)
2. The goal (G) is at (2, 6)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around the current position (3, 4), I can move to:
- Up: (2, 4)
- Right: (4, 4)

Since the goal is at (2, 6), and I need to move upward and right to reach it, moving up to (2, 4) would be the best next move as it gets me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 4), looking at the available empty spaces, I can move to:
- Right: (2, 5)
- Down: (3, 4)

Since the goal is at (2, 6), and I need to move to the right to reach it, moving to (2, 5) is the best choice as it keeps me on the same row and gets me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (2, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 5), looking at the available empty spaces and the goal position, I can see that:
- The goal is at (2, 6), which is one step to the right
- I can move to (3, 6) which is diagonally down-right

Since I can only move in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), and I need to reach (2, 6), I need to find a path that will get me there. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that I can move to (3, 6) through a path.

First, I'll move down to (3, 4).

I choose to move to: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 4), looking at the available empty spaces, I can move to:
- Right: (3, 6) [skipping over the wall at (3, 5)]
- Up: (2, 4)
- Right: (4, 4)

Since my goal is at (2, 6), and I need to get there through the available path, I should move to (3, 6), as this will get me closer to the goal position.

I choose to move to: (3, 6)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)), they form a general "U" shape, with one side of the U having a gap in it (at (3, 5)).

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a U shape but with a slightly different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)

Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 6)

In this new maze, I've:
- Maintained the U shape
- Moved the gap to a different position (removed (3, 4) and made (3, 5) empty instead)
- Changed the player's starting position
- Kept the same goal position
- Ensured there's still a valid path from P to G

The path still forms a U shape but with slightly different connectivity while maintaining the same general structure as the original maze.
