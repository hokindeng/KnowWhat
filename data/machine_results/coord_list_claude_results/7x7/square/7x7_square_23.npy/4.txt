You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (1, 5)
2. The goal is at (4, 4)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (1, 5), I can see that:
- I can move to (1, 4) which is an empty space
- Moving towards (1, 4) will get me closer to the goal position (4, 4)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 4).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (1, 4):
- I can move to (1, 3)
- I can move to (1, 5) (but this would be going backwards)

Since I need to eventually move right and down to reach the goal, and (1, 3) is the only forward option that will allow me to progress through the maze, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 4).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (1, 3):
- I can move to (1, 4) (but this would be going backwards)
- I can move to (2, 3)

Since I need to move right and down to reach the goal, and (2, 3) is the only option that will help me progress towards the goal, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 4).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (2, 3):
- I can move to (1, 3) (but this would be going backwards)
- I can move to (3, 3)

Since I need to move right and down to reach the goal, and (3, 3) is the only option that will help me progress towards the goal, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 4).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 3):
- I can move to (2, 3) (but this would be going backwards)
- I can move to (4, 3)

Since I need to move right and eventually up to reach the goal, and (4, 3) is the only option that will help me progress towards the goal, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), I need to reach the goal at (4, 4).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 3):
- I can move to (3, 3) (but this would be going backwards)
- I can move to (4, 5) (since 4, 4 is the goal)

Since I need to move right to reach the goal, and (4, 5) is the only option that will help me progress (we can move through the goal position at (4, 4)), I choose to move to coordinate (4, 5).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape, with one corridor going down and then another corridor going right.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "L" shaped path but with different wall placements:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (5, 1)

In this new maze, the path still forms an "L" shape, but it's rotated 90 degrees compared to the original. The player starts at the top of the "L" and needs to move left and then down to reach the goal. The corridors are slightly thinner than in the original maze, but the basic "L" shape is maintained.
