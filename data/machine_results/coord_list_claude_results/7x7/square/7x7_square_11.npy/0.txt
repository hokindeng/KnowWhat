You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 3)
2. The goal is at (4, 4)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I can move up, down, left, or right

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 3):
- Up: (2, 2) is empty
- Down: (2, 4) is empty
- Left: wall
- Right: (3, 2) is empty

To get closer to the goal at (4, 4), I should try to move down and right. 
Since (2, 4) is an empty space and it gets me closer to the goal, I'll move there.

My next move is to: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (2, 4):
- Up: (2, 3) is empty
- Down: wall at (2, 5)
- Left: wall
- Right: (3, 4) is empty

To reach the goal at (4, 4), I need to move right to get closer. 
Since (3, 4) is an empty space and it gets me closer to the goal, I'll move there.

My next move is to: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (3, 4):
- Up: wall at (3, 3)
- Down: wall at (3, 5)
- Left: (2, 4) is empty
- Right: (4, 3) is empty

Looking at the goal position (4, 4), I need to get to the right side. 
The best move is to go right through (4, 3), which will allow me to reach the goal.

My next move is to: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (4, 3):
- Up: (4, 2) is empty
- Down: (4, 4) is the goal
- Left: (3, 4) is empty
- Right: wall

Since I can see that (4, 4) is the goal position and it's directly below my current position, I'll move there.

My next move is to: (4, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), with a horizontal line at the top, a diagonal line in the middle, and a horizontal line at the bottom.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different positioning:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,0), (3,2), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)
Empty: (1,1), (3,1), (3,3), (5,5)
Player position: (2,1)
Goal: (5,5)

In this new maze:
- The top horizontal line of the Z is formed by (1,1) to (2,1)
- The diagonal line is formed by (3,1) to (3,3)
- The bottom horizontal line extends to (5,5)
- The path from P to G follows this Z pattern
- The overall size remains 7x7
- The shape is still recognizable as a Z but with different proportions than the original
