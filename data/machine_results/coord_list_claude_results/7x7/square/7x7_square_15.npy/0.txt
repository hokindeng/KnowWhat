You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

Looking at the given coordinates:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 1)
2. The goal is at (2, 4)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I need to avoid walls

From my current position (2, 1), looking at the adjacent spaces:
- Up: (1, 1) is a wall
- Down: (3, 1) is an empty space
- Left: (2, 0) is a wall
- Right: (2, 2) is an empty space

I can either move down to (3, 1) or right to (2, 2). Since the goal is at (2, 4), moving right towards (2, 2) will get me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), let me analyze the possible moves:
- Up: (1, 2) is a wall
- Down: (3, 2) is a wall
- Left: (2, 1) is an empty space
- Right: (2, 3) is an empty space

Since the goal is at (2, 4), and I need to move eastward to reach it, I should move right to (2, 3).

I choose to move to: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 3), let me analyze the possible moves:
- Up: (1, 3) is a wall
- Down: (3, 3) is a wall
- Left: (2, 2) is an empty space
- Right: (2, 4) is the goal

Since I can see the goal directly to my right at (2, 4), and it's a valid move, I'll move there.

I choose to move to: (2, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape, with the path starting at one end of the U, going down, across, and back up to reach the goal.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a U-shape pattern, but with a slightly different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 5)

In this new maze, the U-shape is formed by a vertical corridor going down from (1,1) to (5,1), then horizontally across to (5,5), and finally up to (3,5). The path follows the same general U-shape concept as the original but with different dimensions and a different goal position.
