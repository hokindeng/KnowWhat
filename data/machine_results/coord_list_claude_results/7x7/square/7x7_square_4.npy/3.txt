You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. I'm currently at position (1, 3)
2. The goal is at (2, 1)
3. Looking at the available empty spaces:
   - (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)
   - (1, 1)
   - (2, 2), (2, 3)

From my current position (1, 3), I can move:
- Up to (0, 3)
- Down to (2, 3)
- Left to (1, 1)

Since the goal is at (2, 1), and I need to eventually get there, moving to (1, 1) would bring me closer to the goal position.

I choose to move to: (1, 1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), they form a rough "Z" shape.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)

Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

This new maze has a clear "Z" pattern formed by its empty spaces, starting from the top and moving diagonally down to the bottom, while maintaining the same 7x7 grid size as the original. The path from P to G is valid and traversable through the empty spaces.
