You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current player position (P) is at (1, 3)
2. Goal (G) is at (2, 1)
3. I can only move through empty spaces: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)
4. I need to avoid walls

Looking at the available moves from position (1, 3):
- I can move up to (0, 3) which is an empty space
- I can move down to (2, 3) which is an empty space

To get closer to the goal at (2, 1), I should try to work my way towards that position. The best next move would be to go up to (0, 3), as this will allow me to then move left through the empty spaces to eventually reach the goal.

I choose to move to: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), I can see:
- I can move left to (0, 2) which is an empty space
- I can move down to (1, 3) which is an empty space (but that's where I came from)

To reach the goal at (2, 1), I need to work my way towards the left and then down. The best path would be to move left through the empty spaces.

I choose to move to: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), I can:
- Move left to (0, 1) which is an empty space
- Move right to (0, 3) which is an empty space (but that's where I came from)

To reach the goal at (2, 1), I need to continue moving left and then find a way down. Moving left to (0, 1) is the best option as it brings me closer to a path that can lead to the goal.

I choose to move to: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), I can:
- Move right to (0, 2) which is an empty space (but that's where I came from)
- Move down to (1, 1) which is an empty space

The goal is at (2, 1), which is directly below my current position but two steps down. Since I can move down to (1, 1), this is the obvious choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 1), I can:
- Move up to (0, 1) which is an empty space (but that's where I came from)
- Move right to (1, 3) which is an empty space
- I cannot move directly down to (2, 1) even though that's the goal, as it's not in the list of empty spaces

Looking at the available empty spaces (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), I need to find a path that will eventually lead me to (2, 1).

I can see that I need to go through (2, 2) to reach the goal. To get there, I should move right to (1, 3) first, which will allow me to then move down to (2, 3) and then left to (2, 2).

I choose to move to: (1, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), they form a general "Z" shape when connected.

2) Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but positioned differently:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)

Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (5, 3)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a "Z" shape that's rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise compared to the original. The path from P to G is straightforward and maintains the Z-shaped corridor pattern, just oriented differently.
