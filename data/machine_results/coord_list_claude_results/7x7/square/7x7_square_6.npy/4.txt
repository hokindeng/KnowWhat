You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 3)
2. The goal is at (4, 1)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I need to avoid walls

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 3):
- Up: (2, 2) is empty
- Down: Not possible (wall)
- Left: Not possible (wall)
- Right: (3, 3) is empty

To get closer to the goal at (4, 1), I should try to move towards that direction. Since I can't move directly towards the goal due to walls, I'll need to find a path through the empty spaces.

I'll move to (2, 2), which is upward from my current position. This will help me progress towards the goal.

My next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (2, 2), I can see:
- Up: (2, 1) is empty
- Down: (2, 3) is empty
- Left: Not possible (wall)
- Right: Not possible (wall at 3, 2)

The goal is at (4, 1), and to get there, I need to move towards the right and up. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that (3, 1) is empty, which would be closer to the goal.

To reach (3, 1), I first need to move up to (2, 1).

Therefore, I'll move up to (2, 1).

My next move: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 1), I can see:
- Up: Not possible (wall)
- Down: (2, 2) is empty
- Left: Not possible (wall)
- Right: (3, 1) is empty

The goal is at (4, 1), which is to my right on the same row. Since (3, 1) is empty and it gets me closer to the goal, I should move there.

My next move: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), I can see:
- Up: Not possible (wall)
- Down: Not possible (wall at 3, 2)
- Left: (2, 1) is empty
- Right: (4, 1) is the goal

Since I can move directly to the goal position at (4, 1), which is to my right, I'll make that move.

My next move: (4, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "Z" shape (or reversed "Z" shape, depending on orientation). The path starts from one end, makes a diagonal line through the middle, and ends at the other end.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different orientation and position than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (5, 1)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 1)

In this new maze, I've created a horizontal "Z" shape where:
- The top horizontal line is at y=1, from x=1 to x=5
- The diagonal part goes through (3, 3)
- The path is still continuous and solvable
- The shape is clearly recognizable as a "Z" but is positioned differently from the original maze
