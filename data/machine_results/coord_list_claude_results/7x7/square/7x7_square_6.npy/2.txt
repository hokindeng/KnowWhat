You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The maze is 7x7
2. I'm currently at position (2, 3)
3. The goal is at (4, 1)
4. I need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 3):
- Up: (2, 2) is empty
- Down: not empty
- Left: not empty
- Right: (3, 3) is empty

To get closer to the goal at (4, 1), I should try to move towards that direction. The best next move would be to go up to position (2, 2), as this will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (2, 2), I can see:
- Up: (2, 1) is empty
- Down: (2, 3) is empty
- Left: not empty
- Right: not empty

Since the goal is at (4, 1), and I need to eventually move right and up to reach it, I should move up to (2, 1), which will allow me to then move right towards the goal.

I choose to move to: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 1), I can see:
- Up: not empty (wall)
- Down: (2, 2) is empty
- Left: not empty (wall)
- Right: (3, 1) is empty

Since the goal is at (4, 1), and I'm currently at (2, 1), I should move right to get closer to the goal position. Moving right will put me at the same y-coordinate as the goal while getting me closer on the x-axis.

I choose to move to: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), I can see:
- Up: not empty (wall)
- Down: (3, 3) is empty, but (3, 2) is a wall
- Left: (2, 1) is empty
- Right: (4, 1) is the goal!

Since I can see the goal position directly to my right at (4, 1), and there's no wall between my current position and the goal, I should move right to reach it.

I choose to move to: (4, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)), they form a rough "Z" shape.

2) Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different orientation:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (5, 1)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 1)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a "Z" shape that's more horizontal than the original, but still maintains the characteristic three segments with diagonal connection. The path from P to G is straightforward and valid, moving through the empty spaces.
