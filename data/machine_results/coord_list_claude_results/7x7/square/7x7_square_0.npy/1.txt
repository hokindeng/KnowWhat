You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information:
1. I'm currently at position (4, 2)
2. The goal is at (0, 2)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I can move up, down, left, or right

Looking at the adjacent positions from (4, 2):
- Up: (3, 2) is an empty space
- Down: (5, 2) is a wall
- Left: (4, 1) is a wall
- Right: (4, 3) is an empty space

To reach the goal at (0, 2), I need to move upward. Since (3, 2) is an empty space, this is the optimal move.

I choose to move to position (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (3, 2):
- Up: (2, 2) is an empty space
- Down: (4, 2) is an empty space
- Left: (3, 1) is a wall
- Right: (3, 3) is a wall

Since the goal is at (0, 2), I need to continue moving upward to reach it. Position (2, 2) is an empty space and brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to position (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (2, 2):
- Up: (1, 2) is an empty space
- Down: (3, 2) is an empty space
- Left: (2, 1) is a wall
- Right: (2, 3) is a wall

Since the goal is at (0, 2), I need to continue moving upward to reach it. Position (1, 2) is an empty space and brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to position (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (1, 2):
- Up: (0, 2) is the goal position
- Down: (2, 2) is an empty space
- Left: (1, 1) is a wall
- Right: (1, 3) is a wall

The goal is directly above me at (0, 2), and this is a valid move.

I choose to move to position (0, 2), which will complete the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "T" shape. The vertical line of the T runs from (0,2) to (4,2), and the horizontal line spans from (4,3) to (4,6), with some additional empty spaces above this line.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a T shape:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,0), (3,1), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,0), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)

Empty: (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)

Player position: (4,2)
Goal: (0,2)

This new maze:
- Has the same dimensions as the original
- Contains a clear T shape formed by empty spaces
- Provides a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original (removed some of the additional empty spaces above the horizontal line while maintaining the basic T shape)
- The vertical line of the T serves as the main corridor from player to goal, with the horizontal line forming the top of the T
