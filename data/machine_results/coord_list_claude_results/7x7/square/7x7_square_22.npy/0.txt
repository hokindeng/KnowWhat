You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
- I'm currently at position (5, 3)
- The goal is at (3, 4)
- I can only move through empty spaces
- I need to reach the goal while avoiding walls

Looking at the available empty spaces and their connections, I can see that I need to move upward first to reach the goal.

The valid move from my current position (5, 3) would be to move up to (4, 3), which is an empty space.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 4).

Looking at the available moves:
- I can move up to (3, 3)
- Moving directly right to (4, 4) is not possible as it's a wall
- Moving down to (5, 3) would be going backwards

The best move is to go up to (3, 3), which will put me in a better position to reach the goal at (3, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), I need to reach the goal at (3, 4).

Looking at the available moves:
- I can move right to (3, 4), which is the goal position
- Moving down to (4, 3) would be going backwards
- Moving to other directions is blocked by walls

The obvious choice is to move right to reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation).

2) Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but positioned differently than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise compared to the original
- The path from P to G is straightforward, moving up through the vertical part of the "L"
- The maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions as the original
- The shape is clearly recognizable as an "L" but is distinct from the original maze's configuration
