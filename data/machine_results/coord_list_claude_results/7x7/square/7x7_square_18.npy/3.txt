You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information:
- I'm currently at position (2, 0)
- The goal is at (2, 2)
- I can only move through empty spaces
- Looking at the empty spaces coordinates: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1)

To reach the goal at (2, 2), I need to first move to an adjacent empty space. From my current position (2, 0), I can see that:
- Moving up leads to (1, 0), which is an empty space
- Moving right leads to a wall
- Moving down leads to a wall
- Moving left leads to a wall

Therefore, I will move up to position (1, 0).

My next move coordinates are: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and plan the next move.

From my current position at (1, 0):
- Moving up leads to (0, 0), which is an empty space
- Moving right leads to a wall (1, 1)
- Moving down leads back to (2, 0), which is an empty space but would be moving away from the goal
- Moving left leads to a wall

To reach the goal at (2, 2), I need to eventually get to the right side of the maze. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see there's a path through (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), and then to (2, 2).

Therefore, I will move up to (0, 0) as the first step of this path.

My next move coordinates are: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 0):
- Moving right leads to (0, 1), which is an empty space
- Moving down leads back to (1, 0)
- Moving up or left leads to walls/outside the maze

To reach the goal at (2, 2), I need to continue along the path I identified earlier: (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2)

Therefore, I will move right to (0, 1) to continue along this path.

My next move coordinates are: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1):
- Moving right leads to (0, 2), which is an empty space
- Moving left leads back to (0, 0)
- Moving down leads to a wall (1, 1)
- Moving up leads outside the maze

Continuing along the planned path (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2), I should move right to (0, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2):
- Moving down leads to (1, 2), which is an empty space
- Moving left leads back to (0, 1)
- Moving right leads to a wall (0, 3)
- Moving up leads outside the maze

Continuing along the planned path (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2), I should move down to (1, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 2):
- Moving down leads to (2, 2), which is the goal position
- Moving up leads back to (0, 2)
- Moving right leads to a wall (1, 3)
- Moving left leads to a wall (1, 1)

Since I can move directly to the goal position, I will move down to (2, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (2, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)), they form a general "U" shape, with one side of the U having an additional branch.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that forms a U shape:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0)

Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

This new maze creates a simple U shape where the player must move right along the top, then down the right side to reach the goal. The empty spaces form a clear U pattern without any additional branches, making it a simpler variation of the original maze while maintaining the same basic shape concept.
