You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given information, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 0)
2. The goal is at (2, 2)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. The available empty spaces are: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1)

To reach the goal at (2, 2), I need to find a path through the empty spaces.

Looking at my current position (2, 0), I can see that one of the adjacent empty spaces is (1, 0). Moving up to (1, 0) would be a good first step towards reaching the goal.

Therefore, my next move should be to: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 0), I need to continue finding a path to the goal at (2, 2).

Looking at the adjacent empty spaces from my current position (1, 0), I can:
1. Move up to (0, 0)
2. Move down to (2, 0) (but this would be going backwards)
3. Move right to (1, 2) is not possible as (1, 1) is a wall

The best path to reach the goal would be to move up to (0, 0), then right through (0, 1) and (0, 2), and eventually down to (2, 2).

Therefore, my next move should be to: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 0), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 2).

Looking at the adjacent empty spaces from my current position (0, 0), I can:
1. Move right to (0, 1)
2. Move down to (1, 0) (but this would be going backwards)

Following my planned path to reach the goal, I should move right through (0, 1), then to (0, 2), and eventually down to (2, 2).

Therefore, my next move should be to: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 2).

Looking at the adjacent empty spaces from my current position (0, 1), I can:
1. Move right to (0, 2)
2. Move left to (0, 0) (but this would be going backwards)

Following my planned path to reach the goal, I should continue moving right to (0, 2), and then find a way down to (2, 2).

Therefore, my next move should be to: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 2).

Looking at the adjacent empty spaces from my current position (0, 2), I can:
1. Move down to (1, 2)
2. Move left to (0, 1) (but this would be going backwards)

Since I need to get to (2, 2), and (1, 2) is an empty space that brings me closer to the goal, I should move down.

Therefore, my next move should be to: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 2), I need to reach the goal at (2, 2).

Looking at the adjacent empty spaces from my current position (1, 2), I can see that I can move down to (2, 1), which will get me closer to the goal.

Moving to (2, 1) will put me in position to make one final move to reach the goal at (2, 2).

Therefore, my next move should be to: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 1), I can now make the final move to reach the goal at (2, 2).

Looking at my position and the goal, I need to move right one space to reach it.

Therefore, my next move should be to: (2, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)), they form a general "U" shape. The path goes down, across, and up, then back down to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a U shape but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1)

Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 1)

In this new maze, the U shape is more compact but still maintains the basic U-shaped pattern. The path from P to G would require moving down one side of the U and up the other side to reach the goal, similar to the original maze but with a different specific arrangement.
