You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 5)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (6, 5)
2. The goal is at (4, 6)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I need to move up and right to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (6, 5), I can move to:
- (6, 4) - moving left
- (6, 6) - moving right

Since the goal is at (4, 6), and I need to eventually move upward, I should move right first to position (6, 6), which will allow me to then move upward in subsequent moves.

Therefore, my next move should be to: (6, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 6), I need to move upward to reach the goal at (4, 6).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (6, 6), I can move to:
- (5, 6) - moving up
- (6, 5) - moving left

Since I need to reach (4, 6), I should move upward to get closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move should be to: (5, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (4, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 6), I need to continue moving upward to reach the goal at (4, 6).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (5, 6), I can move to:
- (4, 6) - moving up
- (6, 6) - moving down

Since (4, 6) is the goal position and it's directly accessible from my current position, I should move there.

Therefore, my next move should be to: (4, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape (or reversed "7" shape), with one corridor running vertically and another horizontally, meeting at a right angle.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an "L" shape but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form an "L" shape, but rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise compared to the original
- The vertical part of the "L" is along the y=1 column
- The player starts at the bottom of the vertical corridor
- The goal is at the top of the vertical corridor
- The maze is still 7x7 in size
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The arrangement is different from the original maze while maintaining the "L" shape characteristic
