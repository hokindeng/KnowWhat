You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 4)
2. The goal is at (0, 5)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 4), I can see that:
- (4, 5) is an empty space that's diagonally accessible from my current position
- Moving to (4, 5) would get me closer to the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (4, 5), I need to reach the goal at (0, 5). Looking at the empty spaces:
- I can see that (1, 4) is an empty space that would get me closer to the goal
- To reach it, I can first move to (3, 4), which is also an empty space

Therefore, I choose to move back to coordinate (3, 4), which will allow me to continue my path toward the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 4), I need to reach the goal at (0, 5). Looking at the empty spaces:
- (1, 4) is an empty space that would get me closer to the goal
- It's diagonally accessible from my current position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 4), which will bring me closer to the goal position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze: (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 5), they form a zigzag or "Z" shape pattern when connected.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 5), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (4, 4)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a "Z" shape, but it's oriented slightly differently than the original. The path from P to G is still valid and traversable through empty spaces, and the overall "Z" shape is maintained while being distinct from the original maze.
