You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information:
1. The maze is 7x7 (coordinates from 0,0 to 6,6)
2. Current player position (P) is at (1,3)
3. Goal (G) is at (3,1)
4. Empty spaces are at (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3)
5. All other spaces except those listed as empty and the current player position are walls

Looking at the possible moves from (1,3):
- I can move diagonally to (2,2), which is an empty space
- This would bring me closer to the goal at (3,1)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (2,2), I need to reach the goal at (3,1).
Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (1,1) is empty and would bring me closer to the goal
- (1,3) is empty but would take me away from the goal
- (3,3) is empty but would also take me away from the goal

Since I need to get to (3,1), and (1,1) is an empty space that would help me progress towards the goal, I choose to move to coordinate (1,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (1,1), I need to reach the goal at (3,1).
Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (2,2) is empty and would be a diagonal move
- (1,3) is empty but would take me away from the goal
- (3,3) is empty but would take me away from the goal

Since I need to get to (3,1), and I can't move directly horizontally to (2,1) or (3,1) as they are walls, I need to find an indirect path. The best option appears to be moving back to (2,2) which keeps me closer to potential paths to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (2,2), I need to reach the goal at (3,1).
Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (1,1) would be going backwards
- (1,3) is empty but would take me away from the goal
- (3,3) is empty and while it's not directly towards the goal, it might provide a path

Since I've already tried going through (1,1) and that didn't lead to a solution, and I can't move directly to (3,1) as it's blocked, I should try the remaining unexplored path through (3,3). This might allow me to find a way to reach the goal from a different angle.

I choose to move to coordinate (3,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 2)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (3,3), I need to reach the goal at (3,1).
Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (2,2) would be going backwards
- (1,3) is empty but would take me further from the goal
- (1,1) is empty but would require going through other spaces first

From (3,3), I can now move diagonally to the goal at (3,1) since diagonal moves are allowed.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3,1), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3)), they form a general "X" or "cross" shape, with empty spaces at the corners and center of the X.

2) Here's a new 7x7 maze that maintains an X-shaped path but with different positioning:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,0), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,6), (4,0), (4,1), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)

Empty: (1,1), (2,2), (3,5), (4,2), (5,5)

Player position: (1,1)
Goal: (5,5)

This new maze maintains the X shape of connected spaces but is shifted slightly and rotated compared to the original. The path still requires diagonal movements through the center point (like the original), but now goes from top-left to bottom-right instead of having the goal in the middle of one of the X's arms.
