You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information:
- I'm currently at position (1, 3)
- The goal is at (1, 1)
- I can move to any adjacent empty space (including diagonals)

Looking at the available empty spaces around my current position (1, 3):
- I can move to (2, 2), which is diagonally down-left
- I can move to (3, 3), which is down
- Both of these positions are empty spaces

Since the goal is at (1, 1), which is to the left of my current position, and I need to eventually get there, moving to (2, 2) seems like the better choice as it brings me closer to the goal position.

I choose to move to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), I need to reach the goal at (1, 1).

Looking at the available empty spaces around my current position (2, 2):
- I can move to (1, 3), which is diagonally up-right
- I can move to (3, 1), which is diagonally down-left
- I can move to (3, 3), which is diagonally down-right

Since the goal is at (1, 1), which is up and to the left of my current position, moving to (3, 1) seems like the best choice. Although it moves me down, it gets me to the left side of the maze, from where I can potentially find a path up to the goal.

I choose to move to (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), I need to reach the goal at (1, 1).

Looking at the available empty spaces around my current position (3, 1):
- I can move to (4, 0), which is diagonally down-left
- I can move to (2, 2), which is diagonally up-right
- I can move to (3, 3), which is to the right

Since the goal is at (1, 1), which is up from my current position, and I need to find a way to get there, moving back to (2, 2) seems like the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal vertically.

I choose to move to (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), I need to reach the goal at (1, 1).

Looking at the available empty spaces around my current position (2, 2):
- I can move to (1, 3), which is diagonally up-right
- I can move to (3, 1), which is diagonally down-left
- I can move to (3, 3), which is diagonally down-right

I notice I'm in the same position as before and moving to (3, 1) didn't help me progress toward the goal. Since the goal is at (1, 1), I need to try a different approach. Moving to (1, 3) will get me higher up in the maze, which is closer to the goal's vertical position. From there, I might be able to find a path to (1, 1).

I choose to move to (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 3), I need to reach the goal at (1, 1).

Looking at the available empty spaces around my current position (1, 3):
- I can move to (0, 4), which is diagonally up-right
- I can move to (2, 2), which is diagonally down-left

I notice that I can reach (0, 0) through (0, 4), and from there I might be able to find a path to the goal at (1, 1). Moving down hasn't helped in previous attempts, so let's try the upper path.

I choose to move to (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 4), I need to reach the goal at (1, 1).

Looking at the available empty spaces around my current position (0, 4):
- I can move to (0, 0), which is to the left
- I can move to (1, 3), which is diagonally down-left

Since the goal is at (1, 1), and I can see that (0, 0) is accessible, moving to (0, 0) seems like the best choice. From there, I should be able to reach the goal at (1, 1) since they're adjacent positions.

I choose to move to (0, 0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4), they form a rough "X" or "cross" shape, with points at the corners and center.

Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an X shape but with slightly different positioning:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 1)

Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 6)

This new maze:
1. Maintains the X/cross shape with empty spaces
2. Has a valid path from P to G
3. Is different from the original maze
4. Is the same size (7x7)
5. The empty spaces still form a recognizable X pattern, but with slightly different positioning of the corridors
