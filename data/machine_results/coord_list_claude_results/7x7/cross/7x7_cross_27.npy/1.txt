You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

The maze appears to be a 7x7 grid where:
- P is at (1,3)
- G is at (1,1)
- I need to find a path through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around the current position (1,3), I can see:
- (2,2) is an empty space that's diagonally accessible
- (3,3) is an empty space that's two steps away
- Moving towards (2,2) would get me closer to the goal at (1,1)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,2), I need to get to the goal at (1,1).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position:
- (3,1) is an empty space that's diagonally accessible
- (1,3) is an empty space that I just came from
- The goal (1,1) is blocked by a wall at (2,1)

Since I can't move directly to the goal from here, I need to find an alternate path. Moving to (3,1) seems like a good option as it might allow me to eventually circle around to reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,1), I need to get to the goal at (1,1).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position:
- (4,0) is an empty space that's diagonally accessible
- (2,2) is an empty space that I just came from
- (0,0) is an empty space but not directly accessible from here

I can see that (0,0) is an empty space that would allow me to potentially reach the goal at (1,1). To get there, I should try to move through (4,0).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,0), I need to get to the goal at (1,1).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position:
- (3,1) is an empty space that I just came from
- (0,0) is an empty space that I can eventually reach

Since my goal is at (1,1), and I need to get there through empty spaces, I should try to reach (0,0) first, as it's the only path that could lead to the goal. Moving back to (3,1) is the best option to eventually reach (0,0).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,1), I need to get to the goal at (1,1).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position:
- (2,2) is an empty space that's diagonally accessible
- (4,0) is where I just came from

I need to work my way towards (0,0) to eventually reach the goal at (1,1). The path should go through (2,2) which will allow me to potentially reach (0,0).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,2), I need to get to the goal at (1,1).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position:
- (1,3) is an empty space that's diagonally accessible
- (3,1) is where I just came from
- (3,3) is diagonally accessible

To reach the goal at (1,1), I need to get to (0,0) first. Moving to (1,3) will get me closer to a path that can lead to (0,0).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1,3), I need to get to the goal at (1,1).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position:
- (0,4) is diagonally accessible
- (2,2) is where I just came from

To reach the goal at (1,1), I need to get to (0,0) first. Moving to (0,4) will get me closer to a path that can lead to (0,0).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,4), I need to get to the goal at (1,1).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position:
- (0,0) is accessible along the top row
- (1,3) is where I just came from

Since (0,0) is an empty space and it's the closest position to the goal (1,1), I should move there.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (0,0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze: (0,0), (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,0), (4,4), they form a rough "Z" shape pattern. The main diagonal line runs from top-right to bottom-left, with horizontal segments at both ends.

2) Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a slightly different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 5)

Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (0, 0)

This new maze maintains the "Z" shape with:
- A horizontal segment at the top
- A diagonal line through the middle
- A horizontal segment at the bottom
But it's positioned slightly differently and has a different start and goal position while maintaining solvability.
