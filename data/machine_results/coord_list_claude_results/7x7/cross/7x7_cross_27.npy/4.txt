You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information:
- I'm currently at position (1, 3)
- The goal is at (1, 1)
- I can move to any adjacent empty space (including diagonals)

Looking at the available empty spaces around my current position (1, 3):
- I can move to (2, 2), which is diagonally down-left
- I can move to (3, 3), which is down
- Both of these positions are empty spaces

Since the goal is at (1, 1), which is to the left of my current position, and I need to eventually get there, moving to (2, 2) seems like the better choice as it brings me closer to the goal position.

I choose to move to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (2, 2):
- The goal is at (1, 1), which is diagonally up-left from my position
- Looking at the available empty spaces around me:
  - I can move to (1, 3), which is diagonally up-right
  - I can move to (3, 1), which is diagonally down-left
  - I can move to (3, 3), which is diagonally down-right

Since the goal is at (1, 1), and I need to get there, moving to (3, 1) seems like the best choice. Although it moves me down, it also moves me left, which gets me closer to the goal horizontally. From there, I should be able to find a path up to the goal.

I choose to move to: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (3, 1):
- The goal is at (1, 1), which is two spaces directly up
- Looking at the available empty spaces around me:
  - I can move to (2, 2), which is diagonally up-right
  - I can move to (3, 3), which is to the right
  - I can move to (4, 0), which is diagonally down-left

Since the goal is at (1, 1), and I need to get there, moving back to (2, 2) seems like the best choice. This will get me closer to the goal vertically, and from there I should be able to find a path to reach (1, 1).

I choose to move to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (2, 2):
- The goal is at (1, 1), which is diagonally up-left
- Looking at the available empty spaces around me:
  - I can move to (1, 3), which is diagonally up-right
  - I can move to (3, 1), which is diagonally down-left
  - I can move to (3, 3), which is diagonally down-right

I notice I'm in the same position as before, and moving to (3, 1) would just create a loop. Since the goal is at (1, 1), I should try moving to (1, 3) this time. Although it moves me right, it gets me to the correct vertical level as the goal, and from there I might be able to find a path left to reach (1, 1).

I choose to move to: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I notice I've returned to position (1, 3), which was my starting position. Looking at the maze again:

From my current position at (1, 3):
- The goal is at (1, 1), which is two spaces to the left
- Looking at the available empty spaces around me:
  - I can move to (0, 4), which is diagonally up-right
  - I can move to (2, 2), which is diagonally down-left
  - I can move to (0, 0), which is diagonally up-left

I see now that I can move to (0, 0), which is an empty space diagonally up-left from my current position. From there, I should be able to reach the goal at (1, 1). This is a path I haven't tried yet.

I choose to move to: (0, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 4), they form:

1. A "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern)

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with a Z-shaped path:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (6, 4)

This new maze maintains a Z-shaped corridor but is distinct from the original. The path starts at the top-left and ends at the bottom-right, following a clear zigzag pattern through the middle of the maze.
