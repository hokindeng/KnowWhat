You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm starting at position (6, 2)
2. The goal is at (2, 6)
3. I need to navigate through the empty spaces while avoiding walls

Looking at the empty spaces available and my current position (6, 2), I can see that I can move to (5, 3), which is an empty space diagonally up and to the right from my current position. This seems like a good first step towards the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (5, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 3), I can see that I need to continue moving upward and to the right to reach the goal at (2, 6).

Looking at the available empty spaces, I can move to (4, 4), which is diagonally up and to the right from my current position. This continues my path in the general direction of the goal.

I choose to move to coordinates (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 4), I can see that I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 6).

Looking at the available empty spaces, I can move to (3, 5), which is diagonally up and to the right from my current position. This keeps me moving in the direction of the goal while staying on valid empty spaces.

I choose to move to coordinates (3, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (2, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 5), I need to reach the goal at (2, 6).

Looking at the available empty spaces and my current position, I can move to (2, 6), which is diagonally up and to the right from my current position. This is actually the goal position, so this move will complete the maze!

I choose to move to coordinates (2, 6).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a diagonal line or "slash" shape ("/") from the bottom left to the top right of the maze.

2) Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming a similar diagonal line shape, but with slightly different positioning:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (1, 5)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a diagonal line from bottom left to top right, but I've shifted the pattern slightly and changed the start and goal positions while maintaining the same basic shape. The path is still traversable and follows the same diagonal pattern as the original maze.
