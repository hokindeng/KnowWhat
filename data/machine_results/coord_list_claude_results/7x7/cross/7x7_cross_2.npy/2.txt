You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at (3, 2)
2. The goal (G) is at (5, 0)
3. There are only a few empty spaces to move through
4. I need to find a path that will eventually lead to the goal

Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (3, 0)
- (4, 1)
- (5, 2)

From my current position at (3, 2), I can move to (4, 1), which will get me closer to the goal position. This is a diagonal move northeast.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (5, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (3, 0)
- (3, 2)
- (5, 2)

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move to (3, 0), which will get me closer to the goal position as it will allow me to eventually reach (5, 0). This is a diagonal move northwest.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 0), I need to reach the goal at (5, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (3, 2)
- (4, 1)
- (5, 2)

From my current position at (3, 0), I can move to (4, 1), which will get me closer to the goal position. This is a diagonal move southeast. This position will then allow me to potentially reach the goal at (5, 0).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), I need to reach the goal at (5, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (3, 0)
- (3, 2)
- (5, 2)

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move to (5, 2), which will get me closer to the goal position. Although this moves me one step further south, it's necessary to reach a position from which I can access the goal at (5, 0).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (5, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 1)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), I need to reach the goal at (5, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (3, 0)
- (3, 2)
- (4, 1)

From my current position at (5, 2), I can move to (4, 1), which will get me closer to the goal position. This is a diagonal move northwest, and from there I can continue towards the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), I need to reach the goal at (5, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (3, 0)
- (3, 2)
- (5, 2)

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move to (3, 0), which will get me closer to the goal position. This is a diagonal move northwest. Although this seems like moving away from the goal, we need to use this path to eventually reach (5, 0).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 0), I need to reach the goal at (5, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (3, 2)
- (4, 1)
- (5, 2)

From my current position at (3, 0), I can move to (4, 1), which will get me closer to the goal position. This is a diagonal move southeast. This position will help us continue towards the goal at (5, 0).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I notice that we seem to be going in circles between positions (3, 0) and (4, 1). Looking at the maze more carefully:

1. We are at (4, 1)
2. The goal is at (5, 0)
3. We can move to (5, 2), (3, 0), or (3, 2)

I realize now that from (4, 1), we can actually move directly to (5, 0) since diagonal moves are allowed and there's no wall blocking this diagonal path.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (5, 0), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 2), (3, 2)), they form a "Z" shape when connected. The path zigzags from top to bottom, with two horizontal segments connected by a diagonal line.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but positioned differently:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

In this new maze, the "Z" shape is formed by empty spaces starting from the top-left area and ending in the bottom-right area. The path follows a clear diagonal line connecting two horizontal segments, maintaining the characteristic "Z" shape while being distinct from the original maze.
