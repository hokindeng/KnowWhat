You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 2)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at (3, 2)
2. The goal (G) is at (5, 0)
3. There are only a few empty spaces to move through
4. I need to find a path that will eventually lead to the goal

Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (3, 0)
- (4, 1)
- (5, 2)

From my current position at (3, 2), I can move to (4, 1), which will get me closer to the goal position. This is a diagonal move northeast.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (5, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (3, 0)
- (3, 2)
- (5, 2)

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move to (3, 0), which will get me closer to the goal position as it will allow me to eventually reach (5, 0). This is a diagonal move northwest.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 0), I need to reach the goal at (5, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (3, 2)
- (4, 1)
- (5, 2)

From my current position at (3, 0), I can move to (4, 1), which will get me closer to the goal position. This is a diagonal move southeast. This position will then allow me to potentially reach the goal at (5, 0).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), I need to reach the goal at (5, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (3, 0)
- (3, 2)
- (5, 2)

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move to (5, 2), which will get me closer to the goal position. Although this moves me one step further south, it's necessary to reach a position from which I can access the goal at (5, 0).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (5, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 1)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), I need to reach the goal at (5, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (3, 0)
- (3, 2)
- (4, 1)

From my current position at (5, 2), I can move to (4, 1), which will get me closer to the goal position. This is a diagonal move northwest, and from there I can continue towards the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), I need to reach the goal at (5, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (3, 0)
- (3, 2)
- (5, 2)

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move to (3, 0), which will get me closer to the goal position. This is a diagonal move northwest. Although this seems like moving away from the goal, we need to use this path to eventually reach (5, 0).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 0), I need to reach the goal at (5, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces:
- (3, 2)
- (4, 1)
- (5, 2)

From my current position at (3, 0), I can move to (4, 1), which will get me closer to the goal position. This is a diagonal move southeast. This position will help us continue towards the goal at (5, 0).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I notice that we seem to be going in circles between positions (3, 0) and (4, 1). Looking at the maze more carefully:

1. We are at (4, 1)
2. The goal is at (5, 0)
3. There's a wall at (4, 0) and (5, 1)

I realize now that this maze might not be solvable. From (4, 1), we cannot reach (5, 0) because:
- We can't go directly north due to wall at (4, 0)
- We can't go directly east due to wall at (5, 1)
- We can't go diagonally northeast because both adjacent squares are walls

Therefore, I must conclude that this maze has no solution - there is no valid path to reach the goal position at (5, 0).

Should I still make a move, I would move to (5, 2), but this won't lead us to a solution.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 1)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.You are correct to continue the game. From my current position at (5, 2), I can move to (4, 1).

However, I need to acknowledge that after analyzing the maze structure more carefully in my previous response, I've realized this maze appears to be unsolvable. The goal at (5, 0) is completely surrounded by walls at (4, 0) and (5, 1), making it impossible to reach from any direction.

Despite this realization, I will continue to make valid moves as requested.

I choose to move to coordinates (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.As I mentioned before, this maze is unsolvable because the goal at (5, 0) is completely blocked by walls at (4, 0) and (5, 1), making it impossible to reach. We are now just moving between the available empty spaces without being able to reach the goal.

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move to (3, 0), (3, 2), or (5, 2). Since we've been cycling through these positions and none will lead us to the goal, I'll choose a different move than my last one to avoid immediate repetition.

I choose to move to coordinates (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.As established, this maze is unsolvable because the goal at (5, 0) is completely blocked by walls at (4, 0) and (5, 1). We are simply cycling through the available empty spaces without any possibility of reaching the goal.

From my current position at (3, 0), I can move to (4, 1). While this continues the cycle and won't lead to a solution, I must make a valid move as requested.

I choose to move to coordinates (4, 1).

Would you like me to declare that the maze is unsolvable and stop attempting moves?

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (3, 2), (5, 2)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Yes, I would like to formally declare that this maze is unsolvable. Here's why:

1. The goal position is at (5, 0)
2. There are walls at (4, 0) and (5, 1)
3. These walls completely block any possible access to (5, 0)
4. We cannot move diagonally through walls
5. Therefore, there is no valid path to reach the goal position

We have been cycling between positions (3, 0), (4, 1), and (5, 2), but none of these movements can lead us to the goal due to the wall configuration.

Instead of continuing to make moves in an unsolvable maze, I recommend we stop here and acknowledge that no solution exists.

Would you like me to confirm this conclusion, or should I continue making moves despite knowing they won't lead to a solution?

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I maintain my assessment that this maze is unsolvable, but I will continue to make valid moves as requested.

From my current position at (5, 2), I can move to (4, 1). This continues our cycle through the available empty spaces, but as previously explained, no sequence of moves can ever reach the goal at (5, 0) due to the wall configuration.

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move to (3, 0). This continues our cycle through the available empty spaces, though as established, no sequence of moves can reach the goal at (5, 0) due to the walls at (4, 0) and (5, 1) blocking all possible paths to the goal.

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move to (5, 2). Although we've been cycling through the available spaces, I'll choose a different move than my last one to vary the pattern, even though no sequence of moves can reach the goal at (5, 0) due to the walls at (4, 0) and (5, 1) blocking all possible paths.

I choose to move to coordinates (5, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 2), (3, 2)), they form a "Z" shape pattern.

2) Here's a new 7x7 maze with a solvable path that forms a "Z" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 2), (3, 2)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (5, 2)

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Forms a "Z" shape with its empty spaces
- Has a valid, solvable path from P to G
- Is similar to but not identical to the original maze (main difference is the goal position is now reachable)
- The empty spaces still maintain the distinctive "Z" shape pattern
