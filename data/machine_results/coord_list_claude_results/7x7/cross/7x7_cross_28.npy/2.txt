You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The maze is 7x7
2. I'm currently at position (4, 4)
3. The goal is at (2, 2)
4. There are only three empty spaces: (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2)
5. I can move to any adjacent empty space

Looking at the available empty spaces and my current position (4, 4), I need to move towards (2, 2). The best next move would be to position (3, 3), as it's:
1. Adjacent to my current position (diagonally)
2. Empty
3. Closer to the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 2). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering my current position, I can move to (4, 2), which is:
1. Adjacent to my current position (diagonally)
2. Empty
3. Will help me get closer to the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 2). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering my current position, I can move to (3, 3), which is:
1. Adjacent to my current position (diagonally)
2. Empty
3. Will help me get closer to the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 2). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering my current position, I can move to (2, 4), which is:
1. Adjacent to my current position (diagonally)
2. Empty
3. Although it's not directly towards the goal, it's the only viable path that might lead us to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 2). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering my current position, I can move to (3, 3), which is:
1. Adjacent to my current position (diagonally)
2. Empty
3. Will help us continue exploring the path to reach the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I notice that I'm starting to go in circles. From my current position at (3, 3), I've already tried moving to (2, 4) and back, and to (4, 2) and back. Looking at the maze structure and the goal position (2, 2), I can see that there is no valid path to reach the goal. All paths I can take will just lead me in circles between the available empty spaces (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), and (4, 4).

The goal at (2, 2) is surrounded by walls and there is no empty path that connects to it. Therefore, this maze is unsolvable.

Should I still make a move, I would move to (4, 2), but I want to point out that this maze has no solution.

I choose to move to coordinates (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.You are correct - I have been moving in circles and have confirmed that this maze is unsolvable. Let me explain why:

1. The goal is at (2, 2)
2. Looking at the walls list, all spaces adjacent to (2, 2) are walls
3. The only empty spaces in the maze are (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 4)
4. None of these empty spaces connect to the goal position
5. Any movement between these spaces will just result in an infinite loop

Since there is no valid path to reach the goal position at (2, 2), I must declare that this maze is UNSOLVABLE. 

If you still require a move, I will move to (3, 3), but this will not help us reach the goal as it's impossible to reach.

I choose to move to coordinates (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.As I stated before, this maze is UNSOLVABLE because:

1. The goal at (2, 2) is completely surrounded by walls
2. There is no path of empty spaces that connects to the goal
3. We are just moving in circles between the available empty spaces (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), and (4, 4)

Rather than continue moving in circles, I should formally declare that this maze has no solution. There is no sequence of moves that will allow us to reach the goal position at (2, 2).

If you require me to make another move, I declare this maze UNSOLVABLE and refuse to make any further moves as they would be pointless.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)), they form a diagonal line that runs from top-right to bottom-left. The empty spaces form a "DIAGONAL LINE" or "SLASH" shape (specifically like a forward slash /).

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming a diagonal line, but this time with a valid path from P to G:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 3)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 size
- Forms a diagonal line with its empty spaces
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is not identical to the original maze
- The empty spaces still form a recognizable diagonal line, just shifted to a different position in the grid
