You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The maze is 7x7
2. I'm currently at position (4, 4)
3. The goal is at (2, 2)
4. There are only three empty spaces: (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2)
5. I can move to any adjacent empty space

Looking at the available empty spaces and my current position (4, 4), I need to move towards (2, 2). The best next move would be to position (3, 3), as it's:
1. Adjacent to my current position (diagonally)
2. Empty
3. Closer to the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 2). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering my current position, I can move to (4, 2), which is:
1. Adjacent to my current position (diagonally)
2. Empty
3. Will help me get closer to the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 2). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering my current position, I can move to (3, 3), which is:
1. Adjacent to my current position (diagonally)
2. Empty
3. Will help me get closer to the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 2). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering my current position, I can move to (2, 4), which is:
1. Adjacent to my current position (diagonally)
2. Empty
3. Though it's not directly towards the goal, it's the only viable path that might lead us to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 2). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering my current position, I can move to (3, 3), which is:
1. Adjacent to my current position (diagonally)
2. Empty
3. Will help us continue exploring the path to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 3).

I notice we seem to be moving back and forth between positions. This suggests we might need to find a different approach or that the maze might not have a solution, as we haven't been able to reach the goal position (2, 2) through the available empty spaces.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze - (2, 4), (3, 3), and (4, 2) - they form a diagonal line. However, this diagonal line doesn't provide a complete path from P to G, which explains why we couldn't solve the maze.

Here's my answer:

(1) The general shape formed by the empty spaces is a diagonal line.

(2) Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming a complete diagonal line that allows reaching G from P:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (1, 5)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a complete diagonal line from bottom-left to top-right, and there is a valid path from P to G through these empty spaces.
