You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current player position (P) is at (1,4)
2. Goal (G) is at (1,6)
3. Looking at the available empty spaces and considering valid moves:
   - (2,5) is reachable diagonally from (1,4)
   - (3,4) is not directly reachable from current position
   - (3,6) is not directly reachable from current position

The best path appears to be:
(1,4) -> (2,5) -> (3,6) -> (1,6)

For my first move, I'll move diagonally down-right to (2,5).

Next move: (2,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (1, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,5), I can see:

1. The goal (G) is at (1,6)
2. Available empty spaces:
   - (1,4) is behind me
   - (3,4) is reachable
   - (3,6) is reachable diagonally

To reach the goal at (1,6), I should move to (3,6) which will then allow me to reach (1,6).

Next move: (3,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (1, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,6), I can now move diagonally up-left to reach the goal at (1,6).

Next move: (1,6)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), with the path starting at the top, moving diagonally down to the right, and then diagonally up to the right to reach the goal.

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with a "Z" shape pattern, shifted slightly from the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (2, 6)

This new maze maintains the "Z" shape but is shifted one row down and has slightly different positioning of the empty spaces. The path from P to G still follows the same zigzag pattern as the original maze.
