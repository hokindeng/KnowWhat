You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. Current player position (P) is at (1,4)
2. Goal (G) is at (1,6)
3. Looking at the available empty spaces and considering valid moves:
   - (2,5) is reachable diagonally from (1,4)
   - (3,4) is not directly reachable from current position
   - (3,6) is not directly reachable from current position

The best path appears to be:
(1,4) -> (2,5) -> (3,6) -> (1,6)

For my first move, I'll move diagonally down-right to (2,5).

Next move: (2,5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (1, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,5), I can see:

1. The goal is at (1,6)
2. Available empty spaces are:
   - (1,4) going back is possible but not desirable
   - (3,4) is reachable but would take us away from the goal
   - (3,6) is reachable diagonally and gets us closer to our path to the goal

Since we need to eventually reach (1,6), moving to (3,6) will give us a position from which we can reach the goal.

Next move: (3,6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (1, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,6), I can see:

1. The goal is at (1,6)
2. Available empty spaces are:
   - (2,5) going back is possible but not necessary
   - (3,4) is reachable but would take us away from the goal
   - We can move directly to the goal at (1,6) with a diagonal move

Since we can reach the goal directly from our current position with a diagonal move up-left, that's clearly the best choice.

Next move: (1,6)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((1,4), (2,5), (3,6)), they form a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right, with the goal position (1,6) creating a slight hook or bend at the end.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a similar diagonal line pattern with a hook, but in a different position:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (5, 0)

This new maze creates a diagonal line from top-right to bottom-left, with the path running from (1,5) through (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), and (5,1) to reach the goal at (5,0). The shape principle is maintained but mirrored compared to the original.
