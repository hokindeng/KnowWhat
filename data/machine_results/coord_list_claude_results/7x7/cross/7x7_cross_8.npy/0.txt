You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. I'm currently at position (2, 4)
2. The goal is at (2, 2)
3. Looking at the available empty spaces:
   - (0, 2)
   - (0, 4)
   - (1, 3)

To reach the goal at (2, 2), I need to move towards the left. The best next move would be to position (1, 3), as it's:
- Adjacent to my current position
- An empty space
- Closer to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current situation:

1. I'm currently at position (1, 3)
2. The goal is at (2, 2)
3. Available empty spaces are:
   - (0, 2)
   - (0, 4)
   - (2, 4)

To reach the goal at (2, 2), I need to move diagonally down and left. Looking at the available spaces and considering that I need to get to (2, 2), the best move would be to (0, 2), as it's:
- Adjacent to my current position (diagonally)
- An empty space
- Gets me closer to the goal path

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current situation:

1. I'm currently at position (0, 2)
2. The goal is at (2, 2)
3. Available empty spaces are:
   - (0, 4)
   - (1, 3)
   - (2, 4)

Looking at my position and the goal, I need to move down to reach (2, 2). The best next move would be back to (1, 3), as it's:
- Adjacent to my current position
- An empty space
- Gets me closer to the goal position
- Will allow me to potentially reach (2, 2) in the next move

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current situation:

1. I'm currently at position (1, 3)
2. The goal is at (2, 2)
3. Available empty spaces are:
   - (0, 2)
   - (0, 4)
   - (2, 4)

I notice that I've been moving back and forth between (0, 2) and (1, 3). Looking at the maze structure more carefully, I realize that the goal at (2, 2) is actually surrounded by walls and there's no valid path to reach it. The available empty spaces are:
- Above the goal: blocked by wall at (1, 2)
- To the right of the goal: blocked by wall at (2, 3)
- To the left of the goal: blocked by wall at (2, 1)
- Below the goal: blocked by wall at (3, 2)

Therefore, I must conclude that this maze is unsolvable - there is no valid path to reach the goal position at (2, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 4)), they form a "Y" shape pattern.

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with a solvable path that forms a "Y" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces still form a "Y" shape
- There is a valid path from P to G
- The maze has the same 7x7 dimensions
- The pattern is similar but not identical to the original
- The path is solvable by moving through the "Y" shaped corridor
