You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze:

1. I'm currently at position (2, 4)
2. The goal is at position (2, 2)
3. Looking at the available empty spaces:
   - (0, 2)
   - (0, 4)
   - (1, 3)

To reach the goal at (2, 2), I need to move towards the left. The best next move would be to position (1, 3), as it's:
- Adjacent to my current position
- Empty and available
- Gets me closer to the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current situation:

1. I'm currently at position (1, 3)
2. The goal is at position (2, 2)
3. Available empty spaces are:
   - (0, 2)
   - (0, 4)
   - (2, 4)

To reach the goal at (2, 2), I need to move diagonally down and left. Looking at the available spaces and considering my current position, I can move to (0, 2), which gets me closer to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current situation:

1. I'm currently at position (0, 2)
2. The goal is at position (2, 2)
3. Available empty spaces are:
   - (0, 4)
   - (1, 3)
   - (2, 4)

To reach the goal at (2, 2), I need to move down. Looking at the available spaces and considering my current position, I can move to (1, 3), which will get me closer to the goal position.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current situation:

1. I'm currently at position (1, 3)
2. The goal is at position (2, 2)
3. Available empty spaces are:
   - (0, 2)
   - (0, 4)
   - (2, 4)

Looking at my previous moves and the available spaces, I notice I'm in a cycle. I need to rethink my strategy. From my current position (1, 3), I can move to (2, 4), which although temporarily moves me away from the goal horizontally, it gets me to the correct vertical position. This might open up new possibilities to reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I notice that I've returned to where I started and I'm now in a loop. After analyzing the maze more carefully, I realize that this maze might not be solvable. Let me explain why:

1. I'm at (2, 4)
2. The goal is at (2, 2)
3. The only empty spaces are:
   - (0, 2)
   - (0, 4)
   - (1, 3)

There is no continuous path of empty spaces that can reach (2, 2). The goal position itself appears to be surrounded by walls, and none of the available empty spaces connect to it. Therefore, this maze appears to be unsolvable - there is no valid path from the current position to the goal position.

Should I still make a move, I would move to (1, 3), but I don't believe it's possible to reach the goal in this maze configuration.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.You are correct - I should make my next move even though I've identified that the maze appears unsolvable.

From my current position at (1, 3), I can move to one of the available empty spaces:
- (0, 2)
- (0, 4)
- (2, 4)

Since I've already tried moving to (0, 2) and (2, 4) which led to cycles, I'll try moving to (0, 4), the only space I haven't visited yet.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 4), I can move to one of the available empty spaces:
- (0, 2)
- (1, 3)
- (2, 4)

I've now tried all possible paths and confirmed that the maze is indeed unsolvable because:
1. The goal at (2, 2) is surrounded by walls
2. None of the available empty spaces connect to the goal
3. We can only move between the four empty spaces: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), and (2, 4)

Since I need to make a move, I'll move to (1, 3).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 3), I can move to one of the available empty spaces:
- (0, 2)
- (0, 4)
- (2, 4)

As previously established, this maze is unsolvable because:
1. The goal at (2, 2) is surrounded by walls
2. The available empty spaces form a disconnected region from the goal
3. We can only move between these four positions without ever reaching the goal

Since I must continue moving, and I've recently been at (0, 4), I'll move to (2, 4) this time.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 4), I can move to one of the available empty spaces:
- (0, 2)
- (0, 4)
- (1, 3)

We're continuing to cycle through the same positions in this unsolvable maze. Since I must make a move, and I just came from (1, 3), I'll move to (0, 4) this time.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (0, 4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 4)), they form a "Z" shape when connected.

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with a solvable path that forms a "Z" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (5, 5)

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form a diagonal "Z" shape
- There is a clear path from P to G
- The shape is similar to the original but rotated
- The maze is solvable, unlike the original
- The size remains 7x7
