You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From my current position at (4, 3), I need to reach (4, 1). Looking at the empty spaces and walls:
- I can see that there are empty spaces at (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 2)
- I need to move towards (4, 1) which is to the left of my current position
- I can move to (3, 2) as it's an empty space and it's adjacent to my current position

Therefore, I'll move to (3, 2).

My next move: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), I need to reach (4, 1). Looking at the available moves:

- I can see empty spaces at (2, 1), (2, 3), and (4, 3)
- The goal (4, 1) is down and to the left from my current position
- Moving to (2, 1) would get me closer to the goal while staying on a valid path

Therefore, I'll move to (2, 1).

My next move: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 1), I need to reach (4, 1). Looking at the available moves:

- I can see empty spaces at (2, 3), (3, 2), and (4, 3)
- The goal (4, 1) is directly below my current position
- Moving back to (3, 2) would be the best move as it gets me closer to the goal position

Therefore, I'll move to (3, 2).

My next move: (3, 2)

- The goal (4, 1) is two spaces to the left of my current position
- Moving to (3, 2) is the best option as it will help me get closer to the goal

Therefore, I'll move to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I notice that we seem to be going in circles between positions (2,1), (3,2), and (4,3). Let me analyze the situation more carefully:

From my current position at (2, 1), I need to reach (4, 1). Looking at the maze structure:
- The goal is two rows below my current position
- There appears to be no direct path to (4, 1) from my current position
- Moving back and forth between the same positions won't help reach the goal

After this analysis, I realize this maze might not have a solution. The goal position at (4, 1) appears to be surrounded by walls and is not accessible from any of the empty spaces we can move to.

Should I conclude that this maze is unsolvable?

My next move: Please confirm if this maze has a valid solution or if it's unsolvable.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 3), (4, 1)), they form a "Z" shape. However, in the original maze, the Z is broken because (4, 1) is disconnected from the other empty spaces, making the maze unsolvable.

Here's my new maze design that maintains a proper "Z" shape and is solvable:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 3)

In this new maze:
1. The empty spaces form a complete, connected Z shape
2. The player can move from (2, 1) to (4, 3) through the connected empty spaces
3. The maze maintains the same overall dimensions as the original
4. The Z shape is clearly recognizable in the pattern of empty spaces

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
