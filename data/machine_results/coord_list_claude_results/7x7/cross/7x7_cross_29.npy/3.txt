You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (4, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at (6, 3)
2. The goal (G) is at (4, 5)
3. There are empty spaces at (4, 3), (5, 4), and (6, 5)

To reach the goal at (4, 5), I need to move through the available empty spaces. Looking at the current position (6, 3), I can move to the empty space at (4, 3) as my first move.

Therefore, my next move should be to (4, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 5)), along with the player position (6, 3) and goal (4, 5), I can see that they form a zigzag or Z-shape pattern.

Here's my answer:

1. The general shape formed by the corridors is a Z-shape (or zigzag).

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a Z-shape:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,0), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,0), (4,1), (4,3), (4,4), (4,6), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,5), (6,6)
Empty: (3,1), (4,2), (5,3)
Player position: (6,4)
Goal: (2,0)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a Z-shape, but it's positioned differently and runs from the player position to the goal through a different section of the grid.
