You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at position (5, 6)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3, 4)
3. There are three empty spaces at (3, 6), (4, 5), and (5, 4)
4. The rest are walls

From the current position (5, 6), I need to move towards the goal at (3, 4). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering that I can move in any direction (including diagonals), the best next move would be to:

Move to (4, 5), as this:
1. Is an empty space
2. Is adjacent to the current position
3. Gets us closer to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), analyzing the available moves:

1. The goal is at (3, 4)
2. The empty spaces are at (3, 6), (5, 4), and (5, 6)
3. I need to continue moving towards the goal

Looking at the available moves from (4, 5), I can move to:
- (5, 4) which is empty and gets me closer to the goal
- (3, 6) which is empty but moves away from the goal
- Back to (5, 6) which would be counterproductive

The best move would be to (5, 4) as it:
1. Is an empty space
2. Is reachable from my current position
3. Will help create a path towards the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (5, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 4), analyzing the situation:

1. The goal is at (3, 4)
2. The empty spaces are at (3, 6), (4, 5), and (5, 6)
3. I need to move towards the goal at (3, 4)

Looking at my possible moves from (5, 4), I can move to:
- (4, 5) which is empty and gets me closer to the goal position
- Moving to other empty spaces would take me further from the goal

The best move would be to (4, 5) as it:
1. Is an empty space
2. Is adjacent to my current position
3. Gets me closer to the goal at (3, 4)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), analyzing the situation:

1. The goal is at (3, 4)
2. The empty spaces are at (3, 6), (5, 4), and (5, 6)
3. I need to move towards the goal at (3, 4)

Looking at my possible moves from (4, 5), I can move to:
- (3, 6) which is empty and gets me closer to the goal horizontally
- (5, 4) which would be going backwards
- (5, 6) which would take me further from the goal

The best move would be to (3, 6) as it:
1. Is an empty space
2. Is adjacent to my current position
3. Gets me closer to the goal horizontally, and from there I might be able to reach (3, 4)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 6), analyzing the situation:

1. The goal is at (3, 4)
2. The empty spaces are at (4, 5), (5, 4), and (5, 6)
3. I need to reach (3, 4)

Looking at my current position and the goal:
- I'm at the correct x-coordinate (3)
- I need to move two spaces down to reach y=4
- However, (3, 5) is a wall
- I can't move directly to the goal

Since I can't reach the goal directly and I've reached a dead end, I need to backtrack. The only available move from my current position is to:
- (4, 5) which is empty and will allow me to try a different approach

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), I need to carefully analyze the situation again:

1. The goal is at (3, 4)
2. The empty spaces are at (3, 6), (5, 4), and (5, 6)
3. I've already tried going through (3, 6) which led to a dead end
4. I need to find a different approach

Looking at my possible moves from (4, 5):
- (3, 6) would be going back to the dead end
- (5, 4) might provide a different path to the goal
- (5, 6) would take me further from the goal

The best move would be to (5, 4) as it:
1. Is an empty space
2. Is adjacent to my current position
3. Might provide a different approach to reaching the goal
4. We haven't fully explored this path yet

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (5, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 4), analyzing the situation again:

1. The goal is at (3, 4)
2. The empty spaces are at (3, 6), (4, 5), and (5, 6)
3. We've tried multiple paths but haven't reached the goal

Looking at my possible moves from (5, 4):
- (4, 5) would be going back where we came from
- Other adjacent spaces are walls

After exploring multiple paths, I realize that this maze might not have a solution because:
1. The goal at (3, 4) is surrounded by walls
2. There's no empty space adjacent to the goal position
3. We've explored all possible paths and none of them can reach the goal

However, I still need to make a move, so I'll move to (4, 5) as it's the only valid move available.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After thoroughly exploring all possible paths in this maze, I can definitively conclude that this maze is unsolvable because:

1. The goal position (3, 4) is completely surrounded by walls:
   - (2, 4) is a wall
   - (3, 3) is a wall
   - (3, 5) is a wall
   - (4, 4) is a wall

2. There are no empty spaces adjacent to the goal position, making it impossible to reach.

3. We've explored all possible paths through the available empty spaces at (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), and (5, 6), and none of them can lead to the goal.

Since I must make a move, I'll move to (3, 6), but I want to formally state that this maze has no solution.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I maintain my previous conclusion that this maze is unsolvable because:

1. The goal at (3, 4) is completely surrounded by walls with no accessible adjacent spaces
2. We've explored all possible paths through the available empty spaces
3. There is no way to reach a position adjacent to the goal

However, since I must continue moving, I'll move back to (4, 5) as it's one of the only valid moves available from my current position at (3, 6).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 5).

I want to formally state again that no sequence of moves will ever allow us to reach the goal position (3, 4) in this maze configuration.

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a "Y" shape (or a fork), with three branches meeting at a central point (4, 5). One branch extends up-right to (3, 6), another extends right to (5, 6), and the third extends down-left to (5, 4).

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with a solvable path that also forms a Y shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

In this new maze:
- The Y shape is preserved but rotated slightly
- There is a valid path from P to G
- The empty spaces form three branches meeting at a central point (4, 4)
- The size is the same (7x7)
- The shape is clearly recognizable as a Y
