You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at position (5, 6)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3, 4)
3. There are three empty spaces at (3, 6), (4, 5), and (5, 4)
4. The rest are walls

From the current position (5, 6), I need to move towards the goal at (3, 4). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering that I can move in any direction (including diagonals), the best next move would be to:

Move to (4, 5), as this:
1. Is an empty space
2. Is adjacent to the current position
3. Gets us closer to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), analyzing the available moves:

1. The goal is at (3, 4)
2. The empty spaces are at (3, 6), (5, 4), and (5, 6)
3. I need to continue moving towards the goal

Looking at the available moves from (4, 5), I can move to:
- (5, 4) which is empty and gets me closer to the goal by moving diagonally
- (3, 6) which is empty but moves away from the goal
- Back to (5, 6) which would be counterproductive

The best move would be to (5, 4) as it:
1. Is an empty space
2. Is reachable from my current position
3. Gets me closer to the goal position at (3, 4)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (5, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 4), analyzing the available moves:

1. The goal is at (3, 4)
2. The empty spaces are at (3, 6), (4, 5), and (5, 6)
3. I need to continue moving towards the goal

Looking at the available moves from (5, 4), I can move to:
- (4, 5) which is empty and gets me closer to the goal
- Back to previous positions which would be counterproductive

The best move would be to (4, 5) as it:
1. Is an empty space
2. Is reachable from my current position
3. Gets me closer to the goal position at (3, 4)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), analyzing the available moves:

1. The goal is at (3, 4)
2. The empty spaces are at (3, 6), (5, 4), and (5, 6)
3. I need to continue moving towards the goal

Looking at the available moves from (4, 5), I can move to:
- (3, 6) which is empty and gets me closer to the goal horizontally
- (5, 4) which would be going back
- (5, 6) which moves away from the goal

The best move would be to (3, 6) as it:
1. Is an empty space
2. Is reachable from my current position
3. Gets me closer to the goal position at (3, 4) by reducing the horizontal distance

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 6), analyzing the available moves:

1. The goal is at (3, 4)
2. The empty spaces are at (4, 5), (5, 4), and (5, 6)
3. I need to continue moving towards the goal

Looking at the available moves from (3, 6), I can move to:
- (4, 5) which would be moving away from the goal
- The goal at (3, 4) is two spaces away vertically, but there's a wall at (3, 5)

I realize now that I've reached a dead end. The path to the goal is blocked by walls, and the only available moves would take me further from the goal. This maze appears to be unsolvable from the current position, as there is no valid path to reach (3, 4) from (3, 6).

However, I still need to make a move, so I'll move to (4, 5) as it's the only valid adjacent empty space.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), I can now confirm that this maze is unsolvable. Here's why:

1. The goal is at (3, 4)
2. To reach the goal, we need to get to coordinate (3, 4)
3. However, (3, 4) is completely surrounded by walls:
   - There's a wall at (3, 3)
   - There's a wall at (3, 5)
   - There's a wall at (4, 4)
   - The position (2, 4) is also a wall

Even though I can move between the available empty spaces ((3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 6)), there is no way to reach the goal position as it's completely walled off from all accessible spaces.

Since I need to make a move, I'll move to (5, 4), but this maze has no solution.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (5, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.As I mentioned in my previous move, this maze is unsolvable because the goal position at (3, 4) is completely surrounded by walls, making it impossible to reach from any of the accessible empty spaces.

We are essentially trapped in a cycle between the available empty spaces:
- (3, 6)
- (4, 5)
- (5, 4)
- (5, 6)

None of these positions can lead us to the goal at (3, 4) due to the wall configuration.

Since I must make a move, I'll move to (4, 5), but this is just moving within our trapped area.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.As established, this maze is unsolvable because:
1. The goal at (3, 4) is completely surrounded by walls
2. We are trapped in a cycle between four empty spaces: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), and (5, 6)
3. There is no possible path to reach the goal from any of these accessible spaces

Since I must continue making moves even though there's no solution, I'll move to (3, 6).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 6).

However, I want to formally state that this maze has no solution, and we are simply moving between the available empty spaces without any possibility of reaching the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.As previously stated, this maze is unsolvable because:
1. The goal at (3, 4) is completely surrounded by walls
2. We are trapped in a cycle between four empty spaces: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), and (5, 6)
3. There is no possible path to reach the goal from any of these accessible spaces

Since I must continue making moves despite there being no solution, I'll move to (4, 5), continuing our cycle through the available empty spaces.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 5).

I maintain that this maze has no solution, and we are simply moving in a loop between the accessible empty spaces without any possibility of reaching the goal at (3, 4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a "Y" shape, with three endpoints and a central junction point. However, this Y-shape is disconnected from the goal position, which is what makes the maze unsolvable.

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with a solvable Y-shaped path:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,5), (2,6), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,6), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,6), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)

Empty: (2,4), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)

Player position: (5,5)
Goal: (2,4)

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Forms a clear Y-shape with the empty spaces
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze
- The Y-shape is maintained with three branches meeting at a central point (around 4,4)
- Is solvable because the goal is connected to the path

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
