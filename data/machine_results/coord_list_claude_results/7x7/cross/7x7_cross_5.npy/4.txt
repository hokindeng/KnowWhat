You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at position (5, 6)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3, 4)
3. There are three empty spaces at (3, 6), (4, 5), and (5, 4)
4. The rest are walls

From the current position (5, 6), I need to move towards the goal at (3, 4). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering that I can move in any direction (including diagonals), the best next move would be to:

Move to (4, 5), as this:
1. Gets me closer to the goal
2. Is a valid diagonal move from my current position
3. Is one of the empty spaces

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 4).

Looking at the available empty spaces and my current position, I can see that:
1. I'm at (4, 5)
2. The goal is at (3, 4)
3. Empty spaces are at (3, 6), (5, 4), and (5, 6)

From (4, 5), I can move to (5, 4), which is:
1. A valid diagonal move from my current position
2. One of the empty spaces
3. Will help me progress towards the goal, as it will allow me to reach (3, 4) in subsequent moves

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (5, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 4).

Looking at my current position and the goal:
1. I'm at (5, 4)
2. The goal is at (3, 4)
3. Empty spaces are at (3, 6), (4, 5), and (5, 6)

Since I can move diagonally and the goal is directly two spaces up from my current position, I can move to (3, 4) directly. This is:
1. A valid diagonal move from my current position
2. The goal position itself
3. Will complete the maze

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a "Z" shape, with three connected segments: one horizontal segment at the top (from (3,4) to (3,6)), one diagonal segment in the middle (from (3,6) to (5,4)), and one horizontal segment at the bottom (from (5,4) to (5,6)).

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but in a slightly different position:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (6, 1)

In this new maze, the Z-shape is formed by:
- Top horizontal segment: (2,5) to (3,4)
- Diagonal segment: (3,4) to (5,2)
- Bottom horizontal segment: (5,2) to (6,1)

The path is still navigable from P to G, the shape is still recognizable as a Z, but it's positioned differently from the original maze.
