You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at position (5, 6)
2. The goal (G) is at position (3, 4)
3. There are three empty spaces at (3, 6), (4, 5), and (5, 4)
4. The rest are walls

From the current position (5, 6), I need to move towards the goal at (3, 4). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering that I can move in any direction (including diagonals), the best next move would be to:

Move to (4, 5), as this:
1. Is an empty space
2. Is adjacent to the current position
3. Gets us closer to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 4).

Looking at the available empty spaces and considering my current position, I can move to:
1. (3, 6) - which is an empty space adjacent to my current position
2. (5, 4) - which is an empty space that could be reached diagonally
3. (5, 6) - which would be moving backwards

Since I need to get to (3, 4), the best move would be to go to (5, 4), as this:
1. Is an empty space
2. Can be reached diagonally from my current position
3. Will eventually allow me to reach the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (5, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 4).

Looking at the available empty spaces and my current position, I can see that I need to move back to (4, 5) because:
1. It's an empty space
2. It's adjacent to my current position
3. Moving back to (4, 5) will allow me to then reach (3, 6), which will eventually help me get to the goal at (3, 4)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 4).

Looking at the available empty spaces, I can move to:
1. (3, 6) - which is an empty space adjacent to my current position
2. (5, 4) - which would be moving backwards
3. (5, 6) - which wouldn't help us get closer to the goal

The best move is to go to (3, 6) because:
1. It's an empty space
2. It's adjacent to my current position
3. From there, we might be able to reach the goal at (3, 4)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 6), I need to reach the goal at (3, 4).

Looking at the available empty spaces, I can only move to:
1. (4, 5) - which I've been before
2. Other empty spaces are not directly reachable from my current position

However, I notice that I've been moving back and forth without making progress towards the goal. Looking at the maze structure again, I realize that there might not be a valid path to reach the goal at (3, 4) from the current position. The goal appears to be surrounded by walls and there's no valid path to reach it.

I'll still make a move to (4, 5) since it's the only valid move available, but I believe this maze might be unsolvable.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After analyzing the maze more carefully and seeing how we've been moving back and forth between the same positions, I can now definitively conclude that this maze is unsolvable. Here's why:

1. The goal is at (3, 4)
2. Looking at the walls around (3, 4), it is completely surrounded by walls at:
   - (2, 4) above
   - (4, 4) below
   - (3, 3) to the left
   - (3, 5) to the right

There is no way to reach the goal position as it is completely enclosed by walls. We can keep moving between the available empty spaces at (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), and (5, 6), but we will never be able to reach the goal position at (3, 4).

I should declare that this maze has no solution rather than continue making moves that won't lead to the goal.

Would you like me to confirm that this maze is indeed unsolvable?

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 6)), they form a "Z" shape pattern.

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with a solvable path that forms a "Z" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (5, 2)

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form a clear "Z" pattern
- There is a valid path from P to G
- The shape is similar to the original but shifted slightly and made solvable
- The size remains 7x7
- The path goes from top-right to bottom-left, maintaining the "Z" shape characteristic
