You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 3)
2. The goal is at (0, 5)
3. The empty spaces I can move to are (0, 3), (1, 4), and (2, 5)

Looking at the available empty spaces and considering that I need to reach (0, 5):
- Moving to (1, 4) would be a good step as it brings me closer to both (0, 3) and (2, 5), giving me more options for subsequent moves.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 4), analyzing the available empty spaces and the goal position at (0, 5):

The best move would be to (2, 5) because:
1. It brings me closer to the goal at (0, 5)
2. It's one of the available empty spaces I can move to
3. Moving to (0, 3) or (2, 3) would take me further from the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (2, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 5), analyzing the available empty spaces and the goal position at (0, 5):

The best move would be back to (1, 4) because:
1. It brings me closer to the goal at (0, 5)
2. Moving to any other available empty space (0, 3) or (2, 3) would take me further from the goal
3. From (1, 4), I can potentially reach the goal at (0, 5)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 4), I need to reach the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the pattern of my previous moves, I notice I might be getting into a loop between (1, 4) and (2, 5). Let me try a different approach.

The best move would be to (0, 3) because:
1. Although it's temporarily moving away from the goal horizontally, it gets me to the correct row (row 0)
2. From (0, 3), I might be able to reach (0, 5) in subsequent moves
3. The other available moves ((2, 3) or (2, 5)) would either take me further from the goal or continue the loop

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), I need to reach the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the available moves, I should move to (1, 4) because:
1. I'm currently at (0, 3) and need to get to (0, 5)
2. There's a wall at (0, 4), so I can't move directly right
3. Moving to (1, 4) will allow me to potentially reach (0, 5) in the next move
4. The other available spaces ((2, 3) or (2, 5)) would take me further from the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I notice I'm starting to go in circles. Let me analyze the situation carefully:

1. I'm at (1, 4)
2. The goal is at (0, 5)
3. There's a wall at (1, 5)
4. Available moves are to (0, 3), (2, 3), or (2, 5)

Since moving to (0, 3) led us back to this position, and moving to (2, 5) also led us back here previously, let's try the only path we haven't fully explored yet.

I choose to move to coordinates (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.After exploring multiple paths and ending up in loops, I realize this maze might not have a solution. Let me explain why:

1. The goal is at (0, 5)
2. There's a wall at (0, 4) and (1, 5)
3. We can only move through empty spaces
4. The empty spaces are (0, 3), (1, 4), and (2, 5)
5. There's no way to reach (0, 5) from any of these spaces because:
   - We can't move through walls
   - The walls at (0, 4) and (1, 5) completely block access to (0, 5)

Therefore, this maze appears to be unsolvable - there is no valid path to reach the goal position at (0, 5).

Should I still make a move, I would move to (1, 4), but this would just continue the cycle we've been experiencing.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.You are correct to continue prompting for a move. Even though I believe the maze is unsolvable, I should still provide a move as requested.

From position (1, 4), I have access to three empty spaces:
- (0, 3)
- (2, 3)
- (2, 5)

Since we've already tried paths through (0, 3) and (2, 5) that led to loops, and our last move came from (2, 3), let's move to (2, 5) to continue exploration, even though we know it will likely lead back to the same cycle.

I choose to move to coordinates (2, 5).

However, I maintain my analysis that this maze appears to be unsolvable due to the wall configuration around the goal at (0, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5)), they form a diagonal line that moves from top-left to bottom-right. The shape is a simple diagonal line or slash (/).

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming a diagonal line, but with a solvable path from P to G:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 1)

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 size
- Contains a diagonal line of empty spaces
- Has a valid, solvable path from P to G
- Is not identical to the original maze
- The empty spaces form a recognizable diagonal line, just like in the original
