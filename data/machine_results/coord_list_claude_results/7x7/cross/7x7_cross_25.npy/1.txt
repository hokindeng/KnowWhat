You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 3)
2. The goal is at (0, 5)
3. The empty spaces I can move to are (0, 3), (1, 4), and (2, 5)

Looking at the available empty spaces and considering that I need to reach (0, 5):
- Moving to (1, 4) would be a good step as it brings me closer to both (0, 3) and (2, 5), giving me more options for subsequent moves.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 4), analyzing the available empty spaces and the goal position at (0, 5):

The best move would be to (2, 5) because:
1. It brings me closer to the goal at (0, 5)
2. It's one of the available empty spaces I can move to
3. Moving to (0, 3) or (2, 3) would take me further from the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (2, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 5), analyzing the available empty spaces and the goal position at (0, 5):

The best move would be back to (1, 4) because:
1. It brings me closer to the goal at (0, 5)
2. Moving to any other available empty space (0, 3) or (2, 3) would take me further from the goal
3. From (1, 4), I can potentially reach the goal at (0, 5)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 4), looking at the available empty spaces and the goal at (0, 5):

The best move would be to (0, 3) because:
1. It's the only path that can eventually lead to the goal at (0, 5)
2. Moving to (2, 3) or (2, 5) would take me further from the goal
3. From (0, 3), I should be able to reach (0, 5)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), looking at the available empty spaces and the goal at (0, 5):

The best move would be back to (1, 4) because:
1. Although it seems like we're moving back and forth, this is necessary as we need to find a path to (0, 5)
2. Moving to other available spaces (2, 3) or (2, 5) would take us further from the goal
3. We need to use (1, 4) as a stepping stone to eventually reach (0, 5)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 4), looking at the available empty spaces and the goal at (0, 5):

The best move would be to (2, 5) because:
1. We seem to be in a loop moving between (0, 3) and (1, 4)
2. We need to try a different approach to reach (0, 5)
3. Moving to (2, 5) might give us a different angle to reach the goal
4. The other available spaces (0, 3) and (2, 3) have already been tried or would take us further from the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (2, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 5), looking at the available empty spaces and the goal at (0, 5):

The best move would be back to (1, 4) because:
1. After exploring the available paths, it's clear that we need to use (1, 4) as a key position
2. The other available spaces (0, 3) and (2, 3) would take us further from our goal
3. From (1, 4), we might find a different approach to reach (0, 5)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I notice we're starting to go in circles between positions. Let me analyze the situation carefully:

1. We're at (1, 4)
2. The goal is at (0, 5)
3. We've been moving between (0, 3), (1, 4), and (2, 5)
4. Looking at the walls, I can see that (0, 4) is a wall, but (0, 5) is our goal

From (1, 4), we can reach (0, 5) directly by moving diagonally up-right!
This is the solution I've been missing in previous moves.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (0, 5), which is our goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze ((0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), plus the goal at (0, 5)), they form a zigzag or Z-shape pattern, moving from bottom-left to top-right.

Here's my new maze design with a similar Z-shape pattern:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

This new maze:
1. Maintains a Z-shape pattern for the empty spaces
2. Has the same 7x7 grid size
3. Provides a valid path from P to G
4. Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
5. The Z-shape is rotated compared to the original, but still recognizable as the same pattern
