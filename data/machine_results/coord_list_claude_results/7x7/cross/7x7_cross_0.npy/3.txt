You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal at (5, 1).

From my current position at (1, 1), I need to reach (5, 1). Looking at the empty spaces and considering all possible moves (including diagonals), I can see that I need to navigate through the available empty spaces while avoiding walls.

From position (1, 1), I can move to (2, 2), which is an empty space. This appears to be a good first move as it helps me progress towards the goal position.

Therefore, my next move will be to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (5, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), I need to continue making progress towards the goal at (5, 1). Looking at the available empty spaces, I can see that moving to (3, 3) is possible and would help me progress in the right direction.

Therefore, my next move will be to: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (5, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (5, 1). Looking at the available empty spaces, I can move to (4, 2), which brings me closer to the goal position.

Therefore, my next move will be to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (5, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), I need to reach the goal at (5, 1). Looking at the available moves, I can now move directly to (5, 1), which is the goal position.

Therefore, my next move will be to: (5, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern) from top to bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)

Empty: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)

Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (6, 6)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a "Z" shape, but:
- The path is slightly wider in some places
- The angles of the Z are slightly different
- The start and end positions are at opposite corners
- The overall pattern is still recognizable as a Z while being distinct from the original maze
