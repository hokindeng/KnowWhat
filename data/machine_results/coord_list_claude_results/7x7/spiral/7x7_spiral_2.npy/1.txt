You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at (3, 4)
2. The goal is at (6, 2)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 4):
- Up: (2, 4) is empty
- Down: (4, 4) is empty
- Left: I can't move left as (3, 3) is a wall
- Right: I can't move right as (3, 5) is a wall

Since I need to eventually reach (6, 2), and I'm currently too high and need to go right, moving down to (4, 4) seems like the best option as it will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (4, 4) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (4, 4):
- Up: (3, 4) is empty
- Down: I can't move down as (5, 4) is empty
- Left: I can't move left as (4, 3) is a wall
- Right: I can't move right as (4, 5) is a wall

Since I need to reach (6, 2), and I can move to (5, 4), this will help me get closer to the goal by moving downward and then eventually left towards (6, 2).

I choose to move to: (5, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (5, 4) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (5, 4):
- Up: (4, 4) is empty
- Down: I can't move down as it's not an empty space
- Left: I can't move left as (5, 3) is a wall
- Right: I can't move right as (5, 5) is a wall

Since I need to reach (6, 2), I need to find a path that will let me get there. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that (5, 2) is empty, which would get me closer to the goal. To get there, I'll need to backtrack up and find another path.

I choose to move back up to: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (4, 4) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (4, 4):
- Up: (3, 4) is empty
- Down: (5, 4) is empty
- Left: I can't move left as (4, 3) is a wall
- Right: I can't move right as (4, 5) is a wall

I need to get to (6, 2), and I can see that (4, 2) is an empty space. Moving up to (3, 4) and then trying to navigate towards (4, 2) might be a better strategy than going down again.

I choose to move up to: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (3, 4) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 4):
- Up: (2, 4) is empty
- Down: (4, 4) is empty
- Left: I can't move left as (3, 3) is a wall
- Right: I can't move right as (3, 5) is a wall

I've been going up and down between (3, 4) and (4, 4), which isn't getting me closer to the goal. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that I need to get to (4, 2) to eventually reach (6, 2). To do this, I should try going through the upper path.

I choose to move up to: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (2, 4) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 4):
- Up: I can't move up as it's a wall
- Down: (3, 4) is empty
- Left: (2, 3) is empty
- Right: I can't move right as (2, 5) is a wall

Now I can move left through the empty spaces (2, 3), (2, 2), which will eventually let me get to (4, 2) and then to the goal at (6, 2).

I choose to move left to: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (2, 3) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 3):
- Up: I can't move up as it's a wall
- Down: I can't move down as (3, 3) is a wall
- Left: (2, 2) is empty
- Right: (2, 4) is empty

Since the goal is at (6, 2), and I need to get to a lower row while moving towards column 2, moving left to (2, 2) is the best choice. This will help me get closer to the path that leads to (4, 2) and eventually to (6, 2).

I choose to move left to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (2, 2) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 2):
- Up: I can't move up as it's a wall
- Down: I can't move down as (3, 2) is a wall
- Left: (2, 1) is empty
- Right: (2, 3) is empty

Since I need to get to (6, 2), I need to find a path that will let me get to a lower row. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that moving left and then down through (2, 1) might give me a path to reach (4, 2). 

I choose to move left to: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (2, 1) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 1):
- Up: I can't move up as it's a wall
- Down: I can't move down as (3, 1) is a wall
- Left: (2, 0) is empty
- Right: (2, 2) is empty

I can see that moving to (2, 0) would let me access a path down through (3, 0), (4, 0), and eventually I could move right to reach (4, 2) and continue towards the goal.

I choose to move left to: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (2, 0) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 0):
- Up: I can't move up as (1, 0) is a wall
- Down: (3, 0) is empty
- Left: I can't move left as (2, -1) would be out of bounds
- Right: (2, 1) is empty

Since I need to get to (6, 2), and I can see that moving down through (3, 0), (4, 0) will eventually let me reach (4, 2), moving down is the best choice.

I choose to move down to: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (3, 0) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 0):
- Up: (2, 0) is empty
- Down: (4, 0) is empty
- Left: I can't move left as it would be out of bounds
- Right: I can't move right as (3, 1) is a wall

Since I need to get to (6, 2), and I can see that moving down through (4, 0) and then right to (4, 2) will help me progress towards the goal, moving down is the best choice.

I choose to move down to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (4, 0) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (4, 0):
- Up: (3, 0) is empty
- Down: (5, 0) is empty
- Left: I can't move left as it would be out of bounds
- Right: I can't move right as (4, 1) is a wall

From here, I can either continue down to (5, 0) or move to (4, 2) through some path. Since (4, 2) is empty and it's directly on the same column as our goal (6, 2), that would be the better path.

I choose to move right to: (4, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "U" shape, with two vertical corridors connected by horizontal passages at different points.

Here's a new maze with a similar "U" shape pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)

Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (6, 2)

This new maze maintains:
1. The "U" shape with two main vertical corridors
2. Horizontal connecting passages
3. A valid path from P to G
4. The same overall dimensions
5. A different arrangement of walls while keeping the general shape recognizable

The main difference is that some of the wall and passage positions have been shifted while maintaining the basic "U" structure and ensuring path connectivity.
