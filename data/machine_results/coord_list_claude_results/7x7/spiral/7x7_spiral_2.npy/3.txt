You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at (3, 4)
2. The goal is at (6, 2)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 4):
- Up: (2, 4) is empty
- Down: (4, 4) is empty
- Left: I can't move left as (3, 3) is a wall
- Right: I can't move right as (3, 5) is a wall

Since I need to eventually reach (6, 2), and I'm currently too high and need to go right, moving down to (4, 4) seems like the best option as it will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (4, 4) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (4, 4):
- Up: (3, 4) is empty
- Down: I can't move down as (5, 4) is empty
- Left: I can't move left as (4, 3) is a wall
- Right: I can't move right as (4, 5) is a wall

Since I need to reach (6, 2), and I can move to (5, 4), this will help me get closer to the goal by moving downward and then eventually left towards (6, 2).

I choose to move to: (5, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (5, 4) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (5, 4):
- Up: (4, 4) is empty
- Down: I can't move down as it's not an empty space
- Left: I can't move left as (5, 3) is a wall
- Right: I can't move right as (5, 5) is a wall

Since I need to reach (6, 2), I need to find a path that will let me get there. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that (5, 2) is empty, which would get me closer to the goal. To get there, I need to go back up and find a path through the empty spaces.

I choose to move back up to: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (4, 4) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (4, 4):
- Up: (3, 4) is empty
- Down: (5, 4) is empty
- Left: I can't move left as (4, 3) is a wall
- Right: I can't move right as (4, 5) is a wall

I see that I need to get to (6, 2), and there's an empty space at (4, 2). Moving to (4, 2) would get me closer to the goal, as it would allow me to then move down to (5, 2) and eventually reach (6, 2).

Looking at my options, I need to go up to (3, 4) first, which will allow me to find a path to (4, 2).

I choose to move to: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (3, 4) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 4):
- Up: (2, 4) is empty
- Down: (4, 4) is empty
- Left: I can't move left as (3, 3) is a wall
- Right: I can't move right as (3, 5) is a wall

I need to get to (4, 2) to progress towards the goal. From my current position, I can move up to (2, 4), and from there I can move left through the empty spaces to eventually reach (4, 2).

I choose to move to: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (2, 4) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 4):
- Left: (2, 3) is empty
- Right: I can't move right as (2, 5) is a wall
- Down: (3, 4) is empty
- Up: I can't move up as (1, 4) is a wall

Since I need to get to (4, 2), and there's a path through the empty spaces going left, I should move to (2, 3), which will allow me to continue moving towards (4, 2).

I choose to move to: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (2, 3) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 3):
- Left: (2, 2) is empty
- Right: (2, 4) is empty
- Down: I can't move down as (3, 3) is a wall
- Up: I can't move up as (1, 3) is a wall

Since I need to get to (4, 2), and there's a path through the empty spaces going left, I should move to (2, 2), which will allow me to continue moving towards (4, 2).

I choose to move to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (2, 2) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 2):
- Left: (2, 1) is empty
- Right: (2, 3) is empty
- Down: I can't move down as (3, 2) is a wall
- Up: I can't move up as (1, 2) is a wall

Since I need to get to (4, 2), I need to find a path that will let me get around the wall at (3, 2). Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that I can go left towards (2, 1) and then potentially find a path down to (4, 2).

I choose to move to: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (2, 1) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 1):
- Left: (2, 0) is empty
- Right: (2, 2) is empty
- Down: I can't move down as (3, 1) is a wall
- Up: I can't move up as (1, 1) is a wall

I can see that I can move to (2, 0), and looking at the empty spaces, there appears to be a path through (3, 0), (4, 0) that will eventually let me reach (4, 2) and then the goal.

I choose to move to: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (2, 0) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 0):
- Right: (2, 1) is empty
- Down: (3, 0) is empty
- Up: I can't move up as (1, 0) is a wall
- Left: I can't move left as (2, -1) would be out of bounds

Since I need to get to (6, 2), and I can see a path through (3, 0), (4, 0) that will eventually let me reach (4, 2), I should move down.

I choose to move to: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- Down: (4, 0) is empty
- Right: I can't move right as (3, 1) is a wall
- Left: I can't move left as it would be out of bounds

Since I need to get to (6, 2), and I can continue moving down through the empty spaces at (4, 0), which will eventually let me reach (4, 2), I should continue moving down.

I choose to move to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (6, 0) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (6, 0):
- Up: (5, 0) is empty
- Right: I can't move right as (6, 1) is a wall
- Left: I can't move left as it would be out of bounds
- Down: I can't move down as it would be out of bounds

Looking at the goal at (6, 2), I need to find a path that will let me move right. Since I can't move directly right due to the wall at (6, 1), I need to go up and find an alternate path.

I choose to move to: (5, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- Up: (4, 0) is empty
- Down: (6, 0) is empty
- Right: I can't move right as (5, 1) is a wall
- Left: I can't move left as it would be out of bounds

I see that (5, 2) is an empty space, and from there I could reach (6, 2). To get there, I need to go up first and find a path through (4, 2).

I choose to move to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

I'm at (4, 0) and need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (4, 0):
- Up: (3, 0) is empty
- Down: (5, 0) is empty
- Right: I can't move right as (4, 1) is a wall
- Left: I can't move left as it would be out of bounds

I see that (4, 2) is an empty space, and from there I can reach (5, 2) and then (6, 2). Since I can't move directly right due to the wall at (4, 1), I need to go up to find a path around to (4, 2).

I choose to move to: (3, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the pattern of empty spaces in the original maze, I can observe that:

(1) The empty spaces form a rough "U" shape, with one vertical corridor on the left side, another vertical corridor on the right side, and a horizontal corridor at the bottom connecting them.

(2) Here's a new maze with the same U-shaped pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4)

Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (6, 2)

This new maze maintains the U-shaped corridor pattern but has a slightly different arrangement of walls while still providing a valid path from P to G.
