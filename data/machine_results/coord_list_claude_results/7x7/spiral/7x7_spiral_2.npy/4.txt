You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at (3, 4)
2. The goal is at (6, 2)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 4):
- Up: (2, 4) is empty
- Down: (4, 4) is empty
- Left: I can't move left as (3, 3) is a wall
- Right: I can't move right as (3, 5) is a wall

To get closer to the goal at (6, 2), I should try to move down and then towards the right. The best next move would be to:

Move down to (4, 4)

This will help me progress towards the goal while staying on valid empty spaces.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

I'm currently at (4, 4), and I need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (4, 4):
- Up: (3, 4) is empty
- Down: (5, 4) is empty
- Left: I can't move left as (4, 3) is a wall
- Right: I can't move right as (4, 5) is a wall

Since I need to get to (6, 2), and I can see that there's an empty path through (5, 4), (6, 4), and (6, 3) that will eventually lead to (6, 2), I should continue moving down.

I choose to move to (5, 4)

This will help me progress towards the goal while staying on valid empty spaces.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (6, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

I'm currently at (5, 4), and I need to reach (6, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (5, 4):
- Up: (4, 4) is empty
- Down: I can't move down as (6, 4) is not accessible
- Left: I can't move left as (5, 3) is a wall
- Right: I can't move right as (5, 5) is a wall

Since I need to get to (6, 2), and I can see that there's a path through (5, 2) that will lead me closer to the goal, I should try to get there. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that (5, 2) is accessible.

I choose to move to (5, 2)

This will get me closer to the goal position at (6, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape, with:
- A horizontal line at the top (from (2,0) to (2,4))
- A diagonal section in the middle (from (3,4) to (5,2))
- A horizontal line at the bottom (from (6,2) to (6,4))

Here's my proposal for a new maze with the same "Z" pattern:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (3,0), (3,1), (3,5), (3,6), (4,0), (4,1), (4,5), (4,6), (5,0), (5,1), (5,5), (5,6), (6,0), (6,1), (6,5), (6,6)
Empty: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)
Player position: (2,0)
Goal: (6,4)

This new maze:
1. Maintains the same 7x7 size
2. Has a clear "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces
3. Has a valid path from P to G
4. Is different from the original maze but preserves the characteristic "Z" shape
5. The "Z" is slightly wider than in the original but still clearly recognizable

The main differences from the original are:
- The top horizontal line is more complete
- The diagonal section is wider
- The bottom horizontal line is the same length but shifted
- Different start and end positions, but still along the "Z" path

RECOGNIZE: FAIL

GENERATE: FAIL
