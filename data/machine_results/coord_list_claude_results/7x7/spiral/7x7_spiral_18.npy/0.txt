You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (0, 3)
2. The goal is at (3, 3)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (0, 3), I can see that:
- Up: (0, 2) is empty
- Down: (0, 4) is empty
- Left: Wall at (0, 0)
- Right: Wall at (1, 3)

To make progress toward the goal at (3, 3), I should try to move downward since the goal is below my current position. I can see that (0, 4) is an empty space.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (0, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (0, 4), I can see:
- Up: (0, 3) is empty
- Down: (0, 5) is empty
- Left: Wall at (0, 0)
- Right: Wall at (1, 4)

Since my goal is at (3, 3), I need to eventually move right and slightly up. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that moving down to (0, 5) will allow me to then move right through the empty spaces at (1, 5), (2, 5), and (3, 5), from where I can move up to reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (0, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (0, 5), I can see:
- Up: (0, 4) is empty
- Down: Wall at (0, 6)
- Left: Wall at (0, 0)
- Right: (1, 5) is empty

As planned, I need to move right to make progress toward the goal at (3, 3). I can see that (1, 5) is an empty space, which is part of the path I identified earlier that will eventually let me reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 5)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (1, 5), I can see:
- Up: Wall at (1, 4)
- Down: Wall at (1, 6)
- Left: (0, 5) is empty
- Right: (2, 5) is empty

Continuing with the plan to move toward the goal at (3, 3), I should keep moving right along this path at y=5, which will eventually allow me to move up to reach the goal. I can see that (2, 5) is an empty space.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (2, 5), I can see:
- Up: Wall at (2, 4)
- Down: Wall at (2, 6)
- Left: (1, 5) is empty
- Right: (3, 5) is empty

Continuing with the plan to reach the goal at (3, 3), I should move to (3, 5) and then I'll be able to move up to (3, 4) and eventually reach (3, 3).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I apologize for my previous plan - I made a mistake in my analysis. Looking at my current position at (3, 5), I notice that (3, 4) is actually a wall, so I cannot move up directly as I had planned.

From my current position at (3, 5), I can see:
- Up: Wall at (3, 4)
- Down: Wall at (3, 6)
- Left: (2, 5) is empty
- Right: (4, 5) is empty

Since I can't move up directly, I need to find another path. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that moving right to (4, 5) will allow me to then move up through (4, 4) and (4, 3), from where I can move left to reach the goal at (3, 3).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), I can see:
- Up: (4, 4) is empty
- Down: Wall at (4, 6)
- Left: (3, 5) is empty
- Right: Wall at (5, 5)

Following my plan to reach the goal at (3, 3), I need to move up through (4, 4) and then to (4, 3), from where I can move left to reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 4), I can see:
- Up: (4, 3) is empty
- Down: (4, 5) is empty
- Left: Wall at (3, 4)
- Right: Wall at (5, 4)

Continuing with the plan to reach the goal at (3, 3), I need to move up to (4, 3), from where I can then move left to reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), I can see:
- Up: Wall at (4, 2)
- Down: (4, 4) is empty
- Left: (3, 3) is the goal
- Right: Wall at (5, 3)

I can now move left to reach the goal position at (3, 3).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "Z" shape (or reversed "Z" shape, depending on orientation). The path starts from the top, moves horizontally, then diagonally down, and finally horizontally again.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)

Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (4, 2)

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 size
- Contains a clear "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces
- Provides a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
- The path goes horizontally across the top, diagonally down through the middle, and horizontally across the bottom, forming a recognizable "Z" pattern
