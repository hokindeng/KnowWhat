You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

Looking at the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 2)
2. The goal is at (4, 0)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

From my current position (3, 2), I can see that:
- Moving up is possible as (3, 1) is an empty space
- Moving down would hit a wall at (3, 3)
- Moving left would hit a wall at (2, 2)
- Moving right would hit a wall at (4, 2)

To reach the goal at (4, 0), I need to generally move upward and then right. The best next move would be to move up to position (3, 1).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), I can see that:
- Moving up is possible as (3, 0) is an empty space
- Moving down would lead back to where I came from (3, 2)
- Moving left would hit a wall at (2, 1)
- Moving right would hit a wall at (4, 1)

Since my goal is at (4, 0), I need to first get to (3, 0) and then I'll be able to move right to (4, 0). 

Therefore, I choose to move up to coordinates (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 0), I can see that:
- Moving down would lead back to where I came from (3, 1)
- Moving left would hit a wall at (2, 0)
- Moving right is possible as (4, 0) is the goal position

Since I'm adjacent to the goal position at (4, 0), I can move directly to it.

Therefore, I choose to move right to coordinates (4, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "Z" shape (or reversed "Z" shape, depending on orientation). The path starts from the top, goes horizontally, then diagonally down, and then horizontally again.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different positioning:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

In this new maze:
- The top horizontal line of the Z is formed by (1,1) to (1,3)
- The diagonal part goes from (1,3) through (2,1) and (3,1) to (4,1)
- The bottom horizontal line goes from (4,0) to (5,0)
- The path maintains the Z shape while being different from the original maze
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
