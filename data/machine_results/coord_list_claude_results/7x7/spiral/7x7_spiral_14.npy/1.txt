You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 2)
2. The goal is at (3, 6)
3. I need to move through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (2, 2), I can see that:
- (3, 2) is an empty space
- Moving towards the right and eventually up will help me get closer to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 2).

My next move is: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (3, 2) and analyzing the available empty spaces:

1. I need to reach (3, 6)
2. From my current position, I can see that:
   - (4, 2) is an empty space
   - Moving right and then up through the available path will help me progress towards the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 2).

My next move is: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (4, 2) and analyzing the available empty spaces:

1. I need to reach (3, 6)
2. From my current position, I can see that:
   - (5, 2) is an empty space
   - Moving to (5, 2) will allow me to access the path that leads up to the goal through (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), and eventually to the goal area

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (5, 2).

My next move is: (5, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts from the top, goes down one side, curves at the bottom, and comes back up the other side.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "U" shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 6)

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Forms a clear "U" shape with its corridors
- Provides a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
- The path goes down the left side, curves at the bottom, and comes back up the right side
