You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 2)
2. The goal is at (3, 6)
3. I need to move through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (2, 2), I can see that:
- (3, 2) is an empty space
- Moving towards the right/east direction will help me get closer to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 2).

My next move is: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (3, 2) and analyzing the available empty spaces around me:

- I need to get to (3, 6)
- From (3, 2), I can see that (3, 4) is an empty space
- Moving up to (2, 2) would be going backwards
- Moving down to (4, 2) is possible and is an empty space

Since I need to eventually move right to reach the goal at (3, 6), and (3, 4) is blocked by a wall at (3, 3), I should first move down to (4, 2) which will allow me to find a path around the obstacles.

My next move is: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), analyzing the available empty spaces:

- I need to reach (3, 6)
- Looking at adjacent empty spaces:
  * (5, 2) is available
  * (3, 2) would be going backwards
  * (4, 3) is a wall

Since I need to get around the obstacles to reach the goal, and I can see there's a path of empty spaces through (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6) that will eventually let me reach the goal, I should move down to (5, 2).

My next move is: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), analyzing the available moves:

- I need to reach (3, 6)
- Looking at adjacent empty spaces:
  * (5, 3) is available
  * (4, 2) would be going backwards
  * Other directions are walls

I can see there's a clear path ahead through (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6) that will eventually let me get to the goal. The best move is to start moving right along this path.

My next move is: (5, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 3), analyzing the available moves:

- I need to reach (3, 6)
- Looking at adjacent empty spaces:
  * (5, 4) is available
  * (5, 2) would be going backwards
  * Other directions are walls or outside the maze

Continuing along the path I started, I should keep moving right through the available empty spaces. This will eventually allow me to reach the goal by going up through (4, 6) to (3, 6).

My next move is: (5, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- Looking at adjacent empty spaces:
  * (5, 5) is available
  * (5, 3) would be going backwards
  * Other directions are walls or outside the maze

Continuing along the path, I should keep moving right through the available empty spaces. This will lead me to a position where I can eventually move up to reach the goal at (3, 6).

My next move is: (5, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

I can now move directly to the goal position! Moving up one space will take me to (3, 6), which is the goal.

My next move is: (3, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts at the top, goes down one side, across the bottom, and then back up the other side to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "U" shaped corridor but with slightly different positioning:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 6)

In this new maze:
- The path still forms a "U" shape
- The starting position is at the top-left
- The goal is at the top-right
- The path goes down the left side, across the bottom, and up the right side
- It's different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
