You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 2)
2. The goal is at (3, 6)
3. I need to find a path through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (2, 2), I can see that:
- Up: (1, 2) is empty
- Down: (3, 2) is empty
- Left: blocked by wall
- Right: blocked by wall at (2, 3)

To make progress toward the goal (which is to the right and down), I should try to move in a direction that will eventually allow me to reach the goal. Moving up to (1, 2) would give me access to the path leading to the right side of the maze.

Therefore, I choose to move UP to position (1, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (1, 2), I can see:
- Up: blocked by wall at (0, 2)
- Down: (2, 2) is empty
- Left: blocked by wall at (1, 1)
- Right: (1, 3) is empty

Since I need to get to the goal at (3, 6), which is to the right and down, and I currently have a clear path to the right, I should move in that direction to make progress.

Therefore, I choose to move RIGHT to position (1, 3).

My next move coordinates are: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (1, 3), I can see:
- Up: blocked by wall at (0, 3)
- Down: blocked by wall at (2, 3)
- Left: (1, 2) is empty
- Right: (1, 4) is empty

Since I need to get to the goal at (3, 6), which is to the right and down, and I have a clear path to the right, I should continue moving in that direction to make progress.

Therefore, I choose to move RIGHT to position (1, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (1, 4), I can see:
- Up: blocked by wall at (0, 4)
- Down: (2, 4) is empty
- Left: (1, 3) is empty
- Right: blocked by wall at (1, 5)

Since I need to get to the goal at (3, 6), which is down and to the right, and I can't move directly right due to a wall, I should move down to make progress and potentially find a path that leads to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move DOWN to position (2, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (2, 4), I can see:
- Up: (1, 4) is empty
- Down: (3, 4) is empty
- Left: blocked by wall at (2, 3)
- Right: blocked by wall at (2, 5)

Since I need to get to the goal at (3, 6), which is down and to the right, and I can move down, this seems like the best option as it brings me closer to the goal's vertical position.

Therefore, I choose to move DOWN to position (3, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (3, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (3, 4), I can see:
- Up: (2, 4) is empty
- Down: blocked by wall at (4, 4)
- Left: blocked by wall at (3, 3)
- Right: blocked by wall at (3, 5)

Looking at the overall maze, I need to get to (3, 6), but I'm currently blocked from moving directly right. Since I can't move right or down, and moving up won't help me reach the goal, I should move to a position that will eventually give me access to the right side of the maze.

Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that there's a path through (5, 4) and (5, 5) that could lead to the goal. To access this path, I need to first move left and then down.

Therefore, I need to backtrack. I choose to move LEFT to position (3, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (3, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape, with two vertical corridors connected by a horizontal passage at the bottom.

Here's my new maze design that maintains this "U" shape pattern:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 6)

In this new maze:
1. The left vertical corridor is along x=1
2. The right vertical corridor is along x=6
3. The horizontal connecting passage is along y=5,6
4. The maze maintains the same outer dimensions as the original
5. There is a valid path from P to G
6. The empty spaces clearly form a "U" shape, but with different corridor positions than the original

The main difference from the original is that I've shifted the left vertical corridor more to the left and made the corridors more uniform in width. The basic "U" shape principle remains the same, allowing movement down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal.
