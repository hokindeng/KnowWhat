You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (5, 5)
2. The goal is at (3, 4)
3. I need to avoid all wall coordinates and can only move through empty spaces
4. I can only move up, down, left, or right (no diagonal moves)

Looking at my current position (5, 5), I can see that:
- Moving up is blocked by a wall at (4, 5)
- Moving right is blocked by a wall at (5, 6)
- Moving down would be out of bounds
- Moving left to (5, 4) is possible as it's in the list of empty spaces

Therefore, I should move left to (5, 4) as this brings me closer to the goal position.

My next move coordinates are: (5, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5)

From my current position at (5, 2):
- Moving up is blocked by a wall at (4, 2)
- Moving right would take me back to where I came from
- Moving down would be out of bounds
- Moving left to (5, 1) is possible as it's in the list of empty spaces

I should continue moving left to (5, 1) as this will eventually allow me to find a path that leads upwards towards the goal position at (3, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (5, 1):
- Moving up is blocked by a wall at (4, 1)
- Moving right would take me back to where I came from
- Moving down would be out of bounds
- Moving left to (5, 0) is possible as it's in the list of empty spaces

I should move left to (5, 0) as this will allow me to eventually move upwards through the maze towards the goal position at (3, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (5, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- Moving up to (4, 0) is possible as it's in the list of empty spaces
- Moving right would take me back to where I came from
- Moving down would be out of bounds
- Moving left would be out of bounds

Now I can finally start moving upward through the maze. Moving up to (4, 0) is the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal position at (3, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (4, 0):
- Moving up to (3, 0) is possible as it's in the list of empty spaces
- Moving right is blocked by a wall at (4, 1)
- Moving down would take me back to where I came from
- Moving left would be out of bounds

I should continue moving up to (3, 0) as this brings me closer to the goal position at (3, 4). From there, I'll need to find a path that leads to the right towards the goal.

My next move coordinates are: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (3, 0):
- Moving up to (2, 0) is possible as it's in the list of empty spaces
- Moving right is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Moving down would take me back to where I came from
- Moving left would be out of bounds

I should continue moving up to (2, 0). Although we're at the same y-coordinate as the goal (3), we can't move directly right due to walls. We'll need to go up and find a path that eventually leads us to the goal at (3, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (2, 0):
- Moving up to (1, 0) is possible as it's in the list of empty spaces
- Moving right is blocked by a wall at (2, 1)
- Moving down would take me back to where I came from
- Moving left would be out of bounds

I should move up to (1, 0). We need to get to a higher position in the maze to find a path that will eventually let us move right and then down to reach the goal at (3, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the pattern of empty spaces in the original maze, I can observe that:

1) The empty spaces form a rough "U" shape. The path starts at the top, goes down one side, follows along the bottom, and then goes back up the other side.

2) Here's a new maze with the same U-shape pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)

Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

This new maze maintains the U-shape corridor pattern but has fewer internal walls and a slightly wider passage on the left side. The path from P to G is still navigable, following the U-shape pattern around the edges of the maze.
