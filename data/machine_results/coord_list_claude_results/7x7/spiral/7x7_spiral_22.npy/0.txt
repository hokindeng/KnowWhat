You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (5, 5)
2. The goal is at (3, 4)
3. I need to avoid all wall coordinates and can only move through empty spaces
4. I can only move up, down, left, or right (no diagonal moves)

Looking at my current position (5, 5), I can see that:
- Moving up is not possible as (4, 5) is a wall
- Moving right is not possible as (5, 6) is a wall
- Moving down is not possible as (6, 5) is a wall
- Moving left to (5, 4) is possible as it's in the empty spaces list

Therefore, I will move left to coordinate (5, 4).

My next move is: (5, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (5, 4):
- Moving up is not possible as (4, 4) is a wall
- Moving right is not possible as (5, 5) is not in the empty spaces list
- Moving down is not possible as (6, 4) is a wall
- Moving left to (5, 3) is possible as it's in the empty spaces list

Since I need to get to (3, 4) and I can't move up directly, I'll need to find another path. Moving left will help me get closer to a path that can lead me to the goal.

Therefore, I will move left to coordinate (5, 3).

My next move is: (5, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (5, 3):
- Moving up is not possible as (4, 3) is a wall
- Moving right is not possible as (5, 4) is not in the empty spaces list
- Moving down is not possible as (6, 3) is a wall
- Moving left to (5, 2) is possible as it's in the empty spaces list

I need to continue moving left and then find a path up to reach the goal at (3, 4). Moving left will help me get closer to a potential path that can lead upward.

Therefore, I will move left to coordinate (5, 2).

My next move is: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (5, 2):
- Moving up is not possible as (4, 2) is a wall
- Moving right is not possible as (5, 3) is not in the empty spaces list
- Moving down is not possible as (6, 2) is a wall
- Moving left to (5, 1) is possible as it's in the empty spaces list

I need to continue moving left and then find a path up to reach the goal at (3, 4). Moving left will help me get closer to a potential path that can lead upward.

Therefore, I will move left to coordinate (5, 1).

My next move is: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (5, 1):
- Moving up is not possible as (4, 1) is a wall
- Moving right is not possible as (5, 2) is not in the empty spaces list
- Moving down is not possible as (6, 1) is a wall
- Moving left to (5, 0) is possible as it's in the empty spaces list

I need to continue moving left and then find a path up to reach the goal at (3, 4). Moving left will help me get to a position where I can start moving upward.

Therefore, I will move left to coordinate (5, 0).

My next move is: (5, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (5, 0):
- Moving up to (4, 0) is possible as it's in the empty spaces list
- Moving right is not possible as (5, 1) is not in the empty spaces list
- Moving down is not possible as (6, 0) is a wall
- Moving left is not possible as there are no coordinates at (5, -1)

Now I can finally start moving upward towards the goal. Moving up is the best option as it will help me get closer to the goal position at (3, 4).

Therefore, I will move up to coordinate (4, 0).

My next move is: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (4, 0):
- Moving up to (3, 0) is possible as it's in the empty spaces list
- Moving right is not possible as (4, 1) is a wall
- Moving down is not possible as (5, 0) is not in the empty spaces list
- Moving left is not possible as there are no coordinates at (4, -1)

I need to continue moving up and then find a path to the right to reach the goal at (3, 4). Moving up is the best option as it will help me get closer to the goal position.

Therefore, I will move up to coordinate (3, 0).

My next move is: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (3, 0):
- Moving up to (2, 0) is possible as it's in the empty spaces list
- Moving right is not possible as (3, 1) is a wall
- Moving down is not possible as (4, 0) is not in the empty spaces list
- Moving left is not possible as there are no coordinates at (3, -1)

I need to continue moving up and then find a path to the right to reach the goal at (3, 4). Moving up is the best option as it will allow me to eventually find a path to the right that leads to the goal.

Therefore, I will move up to coordinate (2, 0).

My next move is: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (2, 0):
- Moving up to (1, 0) is possible as it's in the empty spaces list
- Moving right is not possible as (2, 1) is a wall
- Moving down is not possible as (3, 0) is not in the empty spaces list
- Moving left is not possible as there are no coordinates at (2, -1)

I need to continue moving up and then find a path to the right to reach the goal at (3, 4). Moving up is the best option as it will allow me to eventually find a path around the walls to reach the goal.

Therefore, I will move up to coordinate (1, 0).

My next move is: (1, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (1, 0):
- Moving up to (0, 0) is possible as it's in the empty spaces list
- Moving right is not possible as (1, 1) is a wall
- Moving down is not possible as (2, 0) is not in the empty spaces list
- Moving left is not possible as there are no coordinates at (1, -1)

I need to move up and then right through the top row of the maze, as this appears to be the path that will eventually let me get down to the goal position at (3, 4). Moving up is the only viable option right now.

Therefore, I will move up to coordinate (0, 0).

My next move is: (0, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (0, 0):
- Moving up is not possible as there are no coordinates at (-1, 0)
- Moving right to (0, 1) is possible as it's in the empty spaces list
- Moving down is not possible as (1, 0) is not in the empty spaces list
- Moving left is not possible as there are no coordinates at (0, -1)

I need to move right along the top row of the maze, which will eventually allow me to find a path down to the goal position at (3, 4). Moving right is the only viable option right now.

Therefore, I will move right to coordinate (0, 1).

My next move is: (0, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (0, 1):
- Moving up is not possible as there are no coordinates at (-1, 1)
- Moving right to (0, 2) is possible as it's in the empty spaces list
- Moving down is not possible as (1, 1) is a wall
- Moving left to (0, 0) is possible but would be moving backwards

I need to continue moving right along the top row of the maze, which will eventually allow me to find a path down to the goal position at (3, 4). Moving right is the best option.

Therefore, I will move right to coordinate (0, 2).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (0, 2):
- Moving up is not possible as there are no coordinates at (-1, 2)
- Moving right to (0, 3) is possible as it's in the empty spaces list
- Moving down is not possible as (1, 2) is a wall
- Moving left to (0, 1) is possible but would be moving backwards

I need to continue moving right along the top row of the maze, which will eventually allow me to find a path down to the goal position at (3, 4). Moving right is the best option.

Therefore, I will move right to coordinate (0, 3).

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (0, 3):
- Moving up is not possible as there are no coordinates at (-1, 3)
- Moving right to (0, 4) is possible as it's in the empty spaces list
- Moving down is not possible as (1, 3) is a wall
- Moving left to (0, 2) is possible but would be moving backwards

I need to continue moving right along the top row of the maze, which will eventually allow me to find a path down to the goal position at (3, 4). Moving right is the best option.

Therefore, I will move right to coordinate (0, 4).

My next move is: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (0, 4):
- Moving up is not possible as there are no coordinates at (-1, 4)
- Moving right to (0, 5) is possible as it's in the empty spaces list
- Moving down is not possible as (1, 4) is a wall
- Moving left to (0, 3) is possible but would be moving backwards

I need to continue moving right along the top row of the maze until I can find a path down to the goal position at (3, 4). Moving right is the best option.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze my current position and possible moves.

From position (0, 5):
- Moving up is not possible as there are no coordinates at (-1, 5)
- Moving right is not possible as (0, 6) is a wall
- Moving down to (1, 5) is possible as it's in the empty spaces list
- Moving left to (0, 4) is possible but would be moving backwards

Now that I've reached the end of the top row, I need to start moving down. The coordinate (1, 5) is an empty space and will help me get closer to the goal position at (3, 4).

Therefore, I will move down to coordinate (1, 5).

My next move is: (1, 5)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, I can observe that:

1) The empty spaces form a rough "U" shape. Starting from the top row, the path goes down the left side, across the bottom, and up the right side, with some additional branches in the middle.

2) Here's a new maze with a similar "U" shape pattern but with slightly different internal arrangements:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)

Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (3, 4)

This new maze maintains the "U" shape corridor structure but has a slightly wider left vertical passage and different internal connections. It still provides a valid path from P to G while keeping the same general shape as the original maze.
