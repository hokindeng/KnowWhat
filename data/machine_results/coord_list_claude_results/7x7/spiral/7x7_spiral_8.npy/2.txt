You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (4, 1)
2. The goal is at (1, 4)
3. I need to find a path through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at my current position (4, 1), I can see that I can move to:
- Up to (3, 1), which is an empty space
- Down is not possible as (5, 1) is a wall
- Left is not possible as (4, 0) is a wall
- Right to (4, 2), which is an empty space

Since I need to eventually reach (1, 4), moving upward would get me closer to the goal. Therefore, I choose to move to (3, 1).

My next move is: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), let me analyze my possible moves:

1. Up to (2, 1) - This is an empty space
2. Down to (4, 1) - This is an empty space, but I just came from there
3. Left is not possible as (3, 0) is a wall
4. Right is not possible as (3, 2) is a wall

Since I need to reach the goal at (1, 4), and I need to move generally upward and to the right, moving up to (2, 1) is the best choice as it gets me closer to the goal.

My next move is: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 1), let me analyze my possible moves:

1. Up to (1, 1) - This is an empty space
2. Down to (3, 1) - This is an empty space, but I just came from there
3. Left is not possible as (2, 0) is a wall
4. Right is not possible as (2, 2) is a wall

Since I need to reach the goal at (1, 4), and I need to move generally upward and to the right, moving up to (1, 1) is the best choice as it gets me closer to the goal and will allow me to move right through the empty spaces at row 1.

My next move is: (1, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 1), let me analyze my possible moves:

1. Up is not possible as (0, 1) is a wall
2. Down to (2, 1) - This is an empty space, but I just came from there
3. Left is not possible as (1, 0) is a wall
4. Right to (1, 2) - This is an empty space

Since I need to reach the goal at (1, 4), and I can see there's a path of empty spaces along row 1, moving right to (1, 2) is the best choice as it gets me closer to the goal.

My next move is: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 2), let me analyze my possible moves:

1. Up is not possible as (0, 2) is a wall
2. Down is not possible as (2, 2) is a wall
3. Left to (1, 1) - This is an empty space, but I just came from there
4. Right to (1, 3) - This is an empty space

Since I need to reach the goal at (1, 4), and I can continue moving along row 1, moving right to (1, 3) is the best choice as it gets me closer to the goal.

My next move is: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 3), let me analyze my possible moves:

1. Up is not possible as (0, 3) is a wall
2. Down is not possible as (2, 3) is a wall
3. Left to (1, 2) - This is an empty space, but I just came from there
4. Right to (1, 4) - This is the goal position!

Since I can move directly to the goal position at (1, 4), this is clearly the best move.

My next move is: (1, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts from the right leg of the U, goes down and around the bottom curve, and then up the left leg of the U to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms a U-shape pattern, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)

Empty: (1, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 5), (5, 6)

Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (1, 5)

In this new maze, the U-shape is more symmetrical, with two parallel vertical corridors connected by a horizontal corridor at the bottom. The player starts at the bottom of the right leg of the U and needs to traverse up to reach the goal at the top of the right leg.
