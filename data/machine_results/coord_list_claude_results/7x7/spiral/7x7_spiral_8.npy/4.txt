You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (4, 1)
2. The goal is at (1, 4)
3. I need to find a path through the empty spaces while avoiding walls

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 1), I can see that:
- Moving up is possible as (3, 1) is in the empty spaces list
- Moving down is not possible as (5, 1) is in the walls list
- Moving left is not possible as (4, 0) is in the walls list
- Moving right is possible as (4, 2) is in the empty spaces list

To get closer to the goal at (1, 4), I should try to move upward since the goal is above my current position.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (3, 1), I can:
- Move up to (2, 1), which is in the empty spaces list
- Move down to (4, 1), which is in the empty spaces list
- Move left is not possible as (3, 0) is a wall
- Move right is not possible as (3, 2) is a wall

Since the goal is at (1, 4) and I need to move upward and to the right to reach it, moving up to (2, 1) would get me closer to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (2, 1), I can:
- Move up to (1, 1), which is in the empty spaces list
- Move down to (3, 1), which is in the empty spaces list
- Move left is not possible as (2, 0) is a wall
- Move right is not possible as (2, 2) is a wall

Since the goal is at (1, 4), and I need to move upward and to the right to reach it, moving up to (1, 1) would get me closer to the goal. From there, I should be able to move right through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (1, 1), I can:
- Move up is not possible as (0, 1) is a wall
- Move down to (2, 1), which is in the empty spaces list
- Move left is not possible as (1, 0) is a wall
- Move right to (1, 2), which is in the empty spaces list

Since the goal is at (1, 4), and I need to move to the right to reach it, moving right to (1, 2) would get me closer to the goal. This will allow me to continue moving right through the empty spaces towards the goal position.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (1, 2), I can:
- Move up is not possible as (0, 2) is a wall
- Move down is not possible as (2, 2) is a wall
- Move left to (1, 1), which is in the empty spaces list
- Move right to (1, 3), which is in the empty spaces list

Since the goal is at (1, 4), and I need to move to the right to reach it, moving right to (1, 3) would get me closer to the goal. This will allow me to continue moving towards the goal position.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (1, 3), I can:
- Move up is not possible as (0, 3) is a wall
- Move down is not possible as (2, 3) is a wall
- Move left to (1, 2), which is in the empty spaces list
- Move right to (1, 4), which is the goal position!

Since the goal is at (1, 4) and it's directly to my right, I can reach it in one move.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 4), which will complete the maze.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts from the right leg of the U, goes down, across the bottom, and up the left leg to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a U shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (1, 6)

In this new maze:
- The U shape is more symmetrical
- The left and right legs of the U are parallel
- The bottom of the U connects the legs
- There's a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The overall dimensions are the same as the original maze
- The shape is clearly recognizable as a U, but the specific arrangement of walls and spaces is different from the original
