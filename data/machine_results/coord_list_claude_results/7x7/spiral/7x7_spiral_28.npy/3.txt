You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (1, 6)
2. The goal is at (4, 2)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (1, 6), I can see:
- (0, 6) is empty (up)
- (2, 6) is empty (down)

Since I need to eventually reach (4, 2), which is below and to the left of my current position, moving down towards (2, 6) would be the better choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (2, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (2, 6), I can move to:
- (1, 6) is empty (up)
- (3, 6) is empty (down)

Looking at the goal position (4, 2), I need to continue moving downward and then left to reach it. The path will likely need to go through (4, 3) or (4, 4) to eventually reach (4, 2).

Moving down to (3, 6) would bring me closer to the path that can lead to the goal.

I choose to move to: (3, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 6), I can move to:
- (2, 6) is empty (up)
- (4, 6) is empty (down)

Looking at the goal position (4, 2), I need to get to a position where I can move left towards it. Moving down to (4, 6) will allow me to then move left through the empty spaces at (4, 5), (4, 4), and (4, 3) to eventually reach (4, 2).

I choose to move to: (4, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 6), I can move to:
- (3, 6) is empty (up)
- (4, 5) is empty (left)

Since I need to reach the goal at (4, 2), I need to move left through the series of empty spaces at row 4. Moving left to (4, 5) is the next step in that direction.

I choose to move to: (4, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- (4, 6) is empty (right)
- (4, 4) is empty (left)

Since I need to reach the goal at (4, 2), I need to continue moving left along row 4. Moving to (4, 4) will bring me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (4, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "T" shape. The vertical line of the T runs along the right side (column 6) from (0,6) to (4,6), and the horizontal line runs along row 4 from (4,6) to (4,2).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a T shape, but with a different orientation (an upright T):

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (6, 3)

In this new maze:
- The vertical line of the T runs down the middle (columns 2-3)
- The horizontal line of the T spans across the top (row 0)
- The player starts at the top left of the T
- The goal is at the bottom right of the T
- The path from P to G is clear and follows the T shape
- The overall dimensions are the same as the original maze
- The T shape is clearly recognizable but distinct from the original maze's layout
