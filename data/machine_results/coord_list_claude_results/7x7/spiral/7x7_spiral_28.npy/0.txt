You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm starting at position (1, 6)
2. The goal is at (4, 2)
3. I need to navigate through the empty spaces while avoiding walls

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (1, 6), I can see that I can move to:
- (0, 6) - up
- (2, 6) - down

Since the goal is at (4, 2), which is down and to the left of my current position, moving down towards (2, 6) would be the better choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to (2, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 6), I can move to:
- (1, 6) - up
- (3, 6) - down

The goal is at (4, 2), which is down and to the left. Moving down to (3, 6) would continue to bring me closer to the goal position.

Therefore, I choose to move to (3, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 6), I can move to:
- (2, 6) - up
- (4, 6) - down

The goal is at (4, 2), and I need to get to the left. Moving down to (4, 6) would allow me to eventually move left through the empty spaces at (4, 5), (4, 4), and (4, 3) to get closer to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to (4, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 6), I can move to:
- (3, 6) - up
- (4, 5) - left

Since the goal is at (4, 2), I need to move left to reach it. There is a clear path through (4, 5), (4, 4), and (4, 3) that will bring me closer to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), I can move to:
- (4, 6) - right
- (4, 4) - left

Since the goal is at (4, 2), I need to continue moving left to reach it. The path continues through (4, 4) and (4, 3).

Therefore, I choose to move to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 4), I can move to:
- (4, 5) - right
- (4, 3) - left

Since the goal is at (4, 2), I need to continue moving left to get closer to it. Moving to (4, 3) is the next logical step.

Therefore, I choose to move to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), I can move to:
- (4, 4) - right
- (4, 2) - left

The goal is at (4, 2), which is directly to my left and is an available move.

Therefore, I choose to move to (4, 2), which will reach the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "7" shape. The vertical line of the "7" runs along the right side from (0,6) to (4,6), and the horizontal line extends from (4,6) to (4,2), with some additional spaces branching off.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a "7" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)

Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (4, 2)

This new maze maintains:
- Same overall dimensions
- A clear "7" shape formed by the empty spaces
- A valid path from P to G
- A different arrangement from the original while keeping the same general shape
- The horizontal part of the "7" is at the same level as the goal position
- The vertical part of the "7" is more centered than in the original
