You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given information, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (0, 1)
2. The goal is at (3, 5)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (0, 1), I can see that I can move to:
- (1, 1) which is an empty space

Moving to (1, 1) seems like the best first step as it gets me closer to the goal position while staying on a valid path.

Therefore, my next move is to position (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent empty spaces, I can move to:
- (0, 1) going up (but this would be going backwards)
- (2, 1) going down

Since I need to get to the goal at (3, 5), which is down and to the right, moving down to (2, 1) is the logical choice as it brings me closer to the goal while staying on a valid path.

Therefore, my next move is to position (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

Looking at adjacent empty spaces, I can move to:
- (1, 1) going up (but this would be going backwards)
- (3, 1) going down
- (2, 3) going right

Since I need to get to the goal at (3, 5), which is down and to the right, I need to make progress towards both directions. Moving to (2, 3) seems like the better choice because:
1. It gets me closer to the right side where the goal is
2. There appears to be a path that continues towards the goal through the right side

Therefore, my next move is to position (2, 3).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, I can see that they form:

(1) A zigzag or S-shape pattern. The path starts from the top, moves down, then curves to the right and back up, creating an S-like pattern through the maze.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an S-shape pattern:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 1)

Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (5, 1)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form an S-shape, but the pattern is slightly different from the original. The path starts at the top, curves down through the middle, and then curves back to reach the goal, maintaining the S-shape characteristic while being a distinct maze.
