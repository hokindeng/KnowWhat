You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

Looking at the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze:
- The walls form the border and some internal barriers
- I'm currently at position (3, 3)
- The goal is at (5, 5)
- I need to reach the goal by moving through empty spaces

From my current position (3, 3), I can see that:
1. Moving up leads to an empty space at (3, 2)
2. Moving down is blocked
3. Moving left leads to an empty space at (3, 2)
4. Moving right is blocked

To get closer to the goal (5, 5), I should try to move towards the right and down. Since I can't move right directly, I need to find an alternate path. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see there's a path that goes up and then right.

I'll move up to position (3, 2).

My next move: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), I can see:
1. Moving up leads to an empty space at (3, 1)
2. Moving down leads to an empty space at (3, 3)
3. Moving left is blocked
4. Moving right is blocked

To reach the goal at (5, 5), I need to eventually move right and down. Since I can't move right directly from here, I should move up to (3, 1) which might give me access to a path that leads to the right.

My next move: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), I can see:
1. Moving up is blocked
2. Moving down leads to an empty space at (3, 2)
3. Moving left is blocked
4. Moving right leads to an empty space at (4, 1)

Now I can move right, which will get me closer to the goal position. Moving to (4, 1) will allow me to start making progress towards the right side of the maze where the goal is located.

My next move: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), I can see:
1. Moving up is blocked
2. Moving down is blocked
3. Moving left leads to an empty space at (3, 1)
4. Moving right leads to an empty space at (5, 1)

Since the goal is at (5, 5), and I need to move both right and up to reach it, I should move right to (5, 1). This will allow me to then move up through the empty spaces at (5, 2), (5, 3), and (5, 4) to eventually reach the goal.

My next move: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 1), I can see:
1. Moving up is blocked
2. Moving down leads to an empty space at (5, 2)
3. Moving left leads to an empty space at (4, 1)
4. Moving right is blocked

Since the goal is at (5, 5), I need to move up through the vertical corridor at column 5. The first step is to move down to (5, 2), which will then allow me to continue moving up through (5, 3) and (5, 4) to eventually reach the goal.

My next move: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), I can see:
1. Moving up leads to an empty space at (5, 1)
2. Moving down leads to an empty space at (5, 3)
3. Moving left is blocked
4. Moving right is blocked

To reach the goal at (5, 5), I need to continue moving up through the vertical corridor. The next step is to move down to (5, 3), which will bring me closer to the goal.

My next move: (5, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 3), I can see:
1. Moving up leads to an empty space at (5, 2)
2. Moving down leads to an empty space at (5, 4)
3. Moving left is blocked
4. Moving right is blocked

To reach the goal at (5, 5), I need to continue moving up through the vertical corridor. The next step is to move down to (5, 4), which will bring me closer to the goal.

My next move: (5, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 4), I can see:
1. Moving up leads to an empty space at (5, 3)
2. Moving down leads to the goal at (5, 5)
3. Moving left leads to an empty space at (4, 5)
4. Moving right is blocked

The goal is directly below me at (5, 5), so I should move down to reach it.

My next move: (5, 5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts from the middle, goes up one vertical line of the U, across the bottom horizontal line, and up the other vertical line to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "U" shape pattern but with slightly different positioning:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)

Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (5, 5)

In this new maze, the U-shape is more symmetrical, with two parallel vertical corridors connected by a horizontal passage at the bottom. The player starts in the middle and needs to navigate up one side of the U, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal, similar to the original maze but with slightly different corridor positions.
