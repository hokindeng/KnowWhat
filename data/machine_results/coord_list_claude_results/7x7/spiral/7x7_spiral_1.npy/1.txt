You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

Looking at the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze:
- The walls form the border and some internal barriers
- I'm currently at position (3, 3)
- The goal is at (5, 5)
- I need to reach the goal by moving through empty spaces

From my current position (3, 3), I can see that:
1. Moving up leads to an empty space at (3, 2)
2. Moving down is blocked
3. Moving left leads to an empty space at (3, 2)
4. Moving right is blocked

To get closer to the goal (5, 5), I should try to move towards the right and down. Since I can't move right directly, I need to find an alternate path. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see there's a path that goes up and then right.

I'll move up to position (3, 2).

My next move: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), I can see that:
1. Moving up leads to an empty space at (3, 1)
2. Moving down leads to an empty space at (3, 3)
3. Moving left is blocked
4. Moving right is blocked

To reach the goal at (5, 5), I need to eventually move right and down. Since I can't move right directly from here, I should move up to (3, 1) which might give me access to a path that leads to the right.

My next move: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), I can see that:
1. Moving up is blocked
2. Moving down leads to an empty space at (3, 2)
3. Moving left is blocked
4. Moving right leads to an empty space at (4, 1)

Since my goal is at (5, 5), and I need to move both right and down to reach it, I should take the opportunity to move right when possible. From here, I can move right to (4, 1), which gets me closer to the goal horizontally.

My next move: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), I can see that:
1. Moving up is blocked
2. Moving down is blocked (wall at 4, 2)
3. Moving left leads to (3, 1)
4. Moving right leads to (5, 1)

To reach the goal at (5, 5), I need to move both right and up. Moving right to (5, 1) will get me to the correct x-coordinate, and from there I should be able to move up through the empty spaces at (5, 2), (5, 3), and (5, 4) to eventually reach (5, 5).

My next move: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 1), I can see that:
1. Moving up is blocked
2. Moving down leads to (5, 2)
3. Moving left leads to (4, 1)
4. Moving right is blocked

To reach the goal at (5, 5), I need to move upward. Since I'm already at the correct x-coordinate (5), I can move up through the series of empty spaces at (5, 2), (5, 3), and (5, 4) to eventually reach (5, 5).

I'll start by moving up to (5, 2).

My next move: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), I can see that:
1. Moving up leads to (5, 3)
2. Moving down leads to (5, 1)
3. Moving left is blocked
4. Moving right is blocked

To reach the goal at (5, 5), I need to continue moving up. I'm already at the correct x-coordinate (5), and there are empty spaces at (5, 3) and (5, 4) that will lead me toward the goal.

I'll move up to (5, 3).

My next move: (5, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 3), I can see that:
1. Moving up leads to (5, 4)
2. Moving down leads to (5, 2)
3. Moving left is blocked
4. Moving right is blocked

To reach the goal at (5, 5), I need to continue moving up. I'm already at the correct x-coordinate (5), and there's an empty space at (5, 4) that will get me closer to the goal.

I'll move up to (5, 4).

My next move: (5, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 4), I can see that:
1. Moving up leads to (5, 5) - which is the goal!
2. Moving down leads to (5, 3)
3. Moving left is blocked
4. Moving right is blocked

I'm just one step away from the goal. I can move up to reach (5, 5), which is the goal position.

My next move: (5, 5)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts from the middle, goes up one side of the U, across the bottom, and up the other side.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a U-shaped corridor pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5)

Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (5, 5)

In this new maze, the U-shape is more symmetrical, with two parallel vertical corridors connected by a horizontal passage at the bottom. The player starts in the middle and needs to navigate to one of the vertical corridors to reach the goal. The path is still recognizable as a U-shape, but with a different implementation than the original maze.
