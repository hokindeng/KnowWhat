You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information, I can visualize that:
1. I'm starting at position (0,0)
2. The goal is at (1,4)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I need to avoid walls

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (0,0), I can see that:
- Right: (0,1) is an empty space
- Down: Position (1,0) is a wall
- Left and Up: Not possible as I'm at the edge of the maze

Since (0,1) is the only valid move and it's also in the general direction of the goal, I'll move there.

My next move is to: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,1), let me analyze the possible moves:
- Right: (0,2) is an empty space
- Left: (0,0) is an empty space (but that would be going backwards)
- Down: (1,1) is a wall
- Up: Not possible as I'm at the edge of the maze

Since I need to reach (1,4) and I can't go down due to walls, I need to continue moving right along the top row until I can find a path down. Moving to (0,2) will bring me closer to the goal.

My next move is to: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,2), let me analyze the possible moves:
- Right: (0,3) is an empty space
- Left: (0,1) is an empty space (but that would be going backwards)
- Down: (1,2) is a wall
- Up: Not possible as I'm at the edge of the maze

I need to continue moving right along the top row to get closer to the goal position at (1,4). The path down is still blocked by walls, so moving right to (0,3) is the best option.

My next move is to: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,3), let me analyze the possible moves:
- Right: (0,4) is an empty space
- Left: (0,2) is an empty space (but that would be going backwards)
- Down: (1,3) is a wall
- Up: Not possible as I'm at the edge of the maze

I need to continue moving right to get closer to the goal position at (1,4). Moving to (0,4) will put me directly above the goal position, and from there I should be able to find a path down.

My next move is to: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,4), let me analyze the possible moves:
- Right: (0,5) is a wall
- Left: (0,3) is an empty space (but that would be going backwards)
- Down: (1,4) is the goal position!
- Up: Not possible as I'm at the edge of the maze

I can now move directly to the goal position at (1,4).

My next move is to: (1,4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts at the top-left, moves right along the top row, then down along the right side, and finally moves left along the bottom row.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "U" shape pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (5, 4)

In this new maze:
- The path still forms a "U" shape
- The top horizontal corridor remains similar
- The right vertical corridor is preserved
- The bottom horizontal corridor is slightly modified
- The walls in the middle are rearranged but still maintain the "U" shape
- The start and goal positions are different but still allow for a valid path following the "U" shape
