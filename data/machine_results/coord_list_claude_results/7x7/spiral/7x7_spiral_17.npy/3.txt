You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information, I can visualize that:
1. I'm starting at position (0,0)
2. The goal is at (1,4)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I need to avoid walls

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (0,0), I can see that:
- Right: (0,1) is an empty space
- Down: Position (1,0) is a wall
- Left and Up: Not possible as I'm at the edge of the maze

Since (0,1) is the only valid move and it's also in the general direction of the goal, I'll move there.

My next move is to: (0,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,1), let me analyze the possible moves:
- Left: (0,0) is empty
- Right: (0,2) is empty
- Down: (1,1) is a wall
- Up: Not possible (edge of maze)

Since I need to reach (1,4) which is to the right, and moving left to (0,0) would be going backwards, I should continue moving right through the empty spaces.

My next move is to: (0,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,2), let me analyze the possible moves:
- Left: (0,1) is empty
- Right: (0,3) is empty
- Down: (1,2) is a wall
- Up: Not possible (edge of maze)

Since I need to reach (1,4) which is to the right, and moving left would be going backwards, I should continue moving right through the empty spaces.

My next move is to: (0,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,3), let me analyze the possible moves:
- Left: (0,2) is empty
- Right: (0,4) is empty
- Down: (1,3) is a wall
- Up: Not possible (edge of maze)

Since I need to reach (1,4) which is to the right, and moving left would be going backwards, I should continue moving right through the empty spaces.

My next move is to: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (1, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,4), let me analyze the possible moves:
- Left: (0,3) is empty
- Right: (0,5) is a wall
- Down: (1,4) is the goal position!
- Up: Not possible (edge of maze)

I can see that the goal position (1,4) is directly below my current position and it's a valid move.

My next move is to: (1,4)

This should complete the maze as we've reached the goal position!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "7" shape. The path starts at the top left, moves right horizontally, and then has a vertical segment going down on the right side.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "7" shape pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4), (5, 0), (6, 0)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (6, 0)

In this new maze:
- The horizontal part of the "7" is along the top row
- The vertical part of the "7" is along the leftmost column
- The path from start to goal is clear and follows the "7" shape
- The overall dimensions remain 7x7
- The maze is different from the original but maintains the same general shape pattern
