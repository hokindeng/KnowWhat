You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at (4, 3)
2. The goal is at (6, 5)
3. I need to find a path through the empty spaces while avoiding walls

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (4, 3), I can move to:
- (4, 4) which is an empty space and moves me closer to the goal

Moving to (4, 4) seems like the best choice as it gets me closer to the goal position while staying on a valid path.

I choose to move to: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 4), I can move to:
- (4, 5) which is an empty space and continues to move me closer to the goal

Moving to (4, 5) is the best choice as it gets me closer to the goal position while staying on a valid path.

I choose to move to: (4, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 5), I can move to:
- (4, 6) which is an empty space
- (4, 4) which would be going backwards

Since I need to eventually reach (6, 5), and there's a wall at (5, 5), I should move to (4, 6) first, which will allow me to go around the wall and reach the goal.

I choose to move to: (4, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 6), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 6), I can move to:
- (3, 6) which is an empty space
- (4, 5) which would be going backwards

Since I need to reach (6, 5) and there's a wall at (5, 6), moving to (3, 6) is the best choice. This will allow me to find a path around the walls to reach the goal.

I choose to move to: (3, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 6), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 6), I can move to:
- (2, 6) which is an empty space
- (4, 6) which would be going backwards

Moving to (2, 6) is the only forward option available. This seems to be part of the path that will eventually lead us around to the goal.

I choose to move to: (2, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (6, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 6), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (2, 6), I can move to:
- (1, 6) which is an empty space
- (3, 6) which would be going backwards

Moving to (1, 6) is the only forward option available. This appears to be part of the path that will eventually lead us around to the goal by going through the top part of the maze.

I choose to move to: (1, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the pattern of empty spaces in the original maze, I can observe that:

1) The empty spaces form a general "U" shape, where there's a path that goes up one side, across the top, and then down the other side to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze with the same U-shaped pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (6, 5)

This new maze maintains the U-shaped corridor pattern but has some variations in the exact placement of walls while still providing a valid path from start to goal.
