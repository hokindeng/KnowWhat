You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the path from the player position (6,0) to the goal (3,0).

Looking at the coordinates:
1. I'm starting at (6,0)
2. I need to reach (3,0)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I can only move up, down, left, or right

The most direct path would be to move upward since both my current position and the goal are in column 0.

I can see that (5,0) is in the list of empty spaces, so moving up one step is valid.

My next move should be to: (5,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving upward since I need to reach (3,0) and (4,0) is in the list of empty spaces.

The path is clear to continue moving up, so my next move should be to: (4,0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I'll continue moving upward since I need to reach (3,0) and (3,0) is the goal position.

Looking at the coordinates, I can see that moving to (3,0) is valid since it's not in the walls list.

My next move should be to: (3,0)

This should complete the maze as we've reached the goal position!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "E" shape. The vertical line of the "E" is along the leftmost column (column 0), and there are three horizontal lines extending to the right: one at the top (row 0), one in the middle (around row 3), and one at the bottom (row 6).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an "E" shape, but with slightly different wall placements:

Walls: (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

The main differences from the original maze are:
1. The middle horizontal line of the "E" is now two spaces wide (merged corridors)
2. Some wall positions have been adjusted while maintaining the overall "E" shape
3. The path from P to G remains valid through the vertical corridor
