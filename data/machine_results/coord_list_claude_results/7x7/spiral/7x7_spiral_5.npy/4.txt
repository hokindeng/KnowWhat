You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 2)
2. The goal is at (2, 4)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 2), I can see that:
- Up: (1, 2) is empty
- Down: (3, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: Wall

Since the goal is at (2, 4) which is to the right of my current position, I'll need to find a path that eventually leads there. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that going up to (1, 2) will give me access to a path that can lead to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move up to coordinate (1, 2).

My next move: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (1, 2), I can see:
- Up: (0, 2) is empty
- Down: (2, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: Wall

Since I need to get to (2, 4), and I can't move directly right due to walls, I need to find an alternate path. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that I need to go around the walls.

The best path would be to first go up to access the top row of empty spaces, which will allow me to move right and then down towards the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move up to coordinate (0, 2).

My next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), I can see:
- Right: (0, 3) is empty
- Down: (1, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Up: Not possible (outside maze)

Since I need to get to (2, 4), and I'm currently in the top row, I should continue moving right along the top row. This will allow me to eventually move down towards the goal position.

Therefore, I choose to move right to coordinate (0, 3).

My next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), I can see:
- Right: (0, 4) is empty
- Left: (0, 2) is empty
- Down: Wall
- Up: Not possible (outside maze)

Since I need to get to (2, 4), and I'm currently in the top row, I should continue moving right. This will allow me to eventually find a path down towards the goal position.

Therefore, I choose to move right to coordinate (0, 4).

My next move: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 4), I can see:
- Right: (0, 5) is empty
- Left: (0, 3) is empty
- Down: Wall
- Up: Not possible (outside maze)

Looking at the overall maze structure and the goal at (2, 4), I need to continue moving right and then find a path down. I can see that there are empty spaces at (2, 5) and (2, 6) which I might be able to use to reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move right to coordinate (0, 5).

My next move: (0, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 5), I can see:
- Right: (0, 6) is empty
- Left: (0, 4) is empty
- Down: Wall
- Up: Not possible (outside maze)

Looking at the maze structure, I can see that I need to continue moving right to eventually access the path that leads to (2, 5) and then to the goal at (2, 4). Moving right will give me access to a potential path down through the right side of the maze.

Therefore, I choose to move right to coordinate (0, 6).

My next move: (0, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 6)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 6), I can see:
- Left: (0, 5) is empty
- Down: Wall
- Right: Wall
- Up: Not possible (outside maze)

Looking at the maze structure, I can see that I've reached the right edge of the maze. I notice that there are empty spaces at (2, 6), (3, 6), and (4, 6) below me, which connect to a path that can lead to the goal. I need to find a way to get down to those spaces.

Looking at the available empty spaces, I need to backtrack since I've hit a dead end at (0, 6). I should go back left and try to find another path.

Therefore, I choose to move left to coordinate (0, 5).

My next move: (0, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 5), I can see:
- Left: (0, 4) is empty
- Right: (0, 6) is empty
- Down: Wall
- Up: Not possible (outside maze)

I need to continue backtracking since I've discovered that the right side path doesn't lead to a solution. I should go back towards the left where there are more empty spaces that might provide a path to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move left to coordinate (0, 4).

My next move: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 4), I can see:
- Left: (0, 3) is empty
- Right: (0, 5) is empty
- Down: Wall
- Up: Not possible (outside maze)

After exploring the right side of the maze and finding no viable path, I need to continue backtracking left. I can see that there's a path through (1, 2) and (2, 2) that might lead to a solution, as there are empty spaces at (4, 2) through (4, 4) that could potentially connect to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move left to coordinate (0, 3).

My next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), I can see:
- Left: (0, 2) is empty
- Right: (0, 4) is empty
- Down: Wall
- Up: Not possible (outside maze)

I need to continue moving left to access the path that goes through (1, 2) and (2, 2). From there, I can see that there's a path through (3, 2) and (4, 2) that connects to (4, 3) and (4, 4), which should allow me to reach the goal at (2, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move left to coordinate (0, 2).

My next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), I can see:
- Right: (0, 3) is empty
- Down: (1, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Up: Not possible (outside maze)

Now I can finally move down to access the vertical path that will lead me towards the goal. I can see that going down through (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), and (4, 2) will eventually allow me to reach (4, 3) and (4, 4), which should help me get to the goal at (2, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move down to coordinate (1, 2).

My next move: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 2), I can see:
- Up: (0, 2) is empty
- Down: (2, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: Wall

I should continue moving down through the vertical corridor. This will allow me to reach (4, 2) and then move right through (4, 3) and (4, 4) to eventually reach the goal at (2, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move down to coordinate (2, 2).

My next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), I can see:
- Up: (1, 2) is empty
- Down: (3, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: Wall

Following the plan to reach (4, 2) and then move right through (4, 3) and (4, 4), I should continue moving down the vertical corridor.

Therefore, I choose to move down to coordinate (3, 2).

My next move: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), I can see:
- Up: (2, 2) is empty
- Down: (4, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: Wall

Continuing with the plan, I need to reach (4, 2) so I can then move right through (4, 3) and (4, 4) to eventually reach the goal at (2, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move down to coordinate (4, 2).

My next move: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), I can see:
- Up: (3, 2) is empty
- Right: (4, 3) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Down: Wall

Now that I've reached (4, 2), I can start moving right through the horizontal corridor at row 4. This will allow me to get to (4, 4) and then find a way up to the goal at (2, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move right to coordinate (4, 3).

My next move: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), I can see:
- Left: (4, 2) is empty
- Right: (4, 4) is empty
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall

I should continue moving right along row 4 to reach (4, 4), which will then allow me to find a path up to the goal at (2, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move right to coordinate (4, 4).

My next move: (4, 4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, I can see that they form:

1. A "T" shape, where:
- The top horizontal line of the T spans across the top row (0, 2) to (0, 6)
- The vertical line of the T runs down column 2 from (0, 2) to (4, 2)
- The bottom horizontal line spans from (4, 2) to (4, 6)

2. Here's a new maze with the same T-shape pattern but slightly modified:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)

Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (4, 5)

This new maze maintains the T-shape but:
- Removes some of the additional branches from the original
- Places the start and goal positions at different locations
- Maintains the same basic structure with a top horizontal corridor and a vertical stem that connects to a bottom horizontal corridor
