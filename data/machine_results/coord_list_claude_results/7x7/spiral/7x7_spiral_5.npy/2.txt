You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 2)
2. The goal is at (2, 4)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 2), I can see that:
- Up: (1, 2) is empty
- Down: (3, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: Wall

Since the goal is at (2, 4) which is to the right of my current position, I'll need to find a path that eventually leads there. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that I need to go up first to access the path that leads to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move up to position (1, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 2), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Up: (0, 2) is empty
- Down: (2, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: Wall

The goal is at (2, 4), and I need to find a path that will eventually lead me there. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that I need to go up to (0, 2) first, which will allow me to access a path that leads towards the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move up to position (0, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Up: Wall
- Down: (1, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: (0, 3) is empty

The goal is at (2, 4), and I need to find a path that will eventually lead me there. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that moving right through (0, 3), (0, 4) will allow me to eventually reach the goal area.

Therefore, I choose to move right to position (0, 3).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall (1, 3) is a wall
- Left: (0, 2) is empty
- Right: (0, 4) is empty

The goal is at (2, 4), and I need to continue moving towards it. Since I need to eventually get to (2, 4), and there's a path of empty spaces leading to the right, I should continue moving right.

Therefore, I choose to move right to position (0, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 4), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall (1, 4) is a wall
- Left: (0, 3) is empty
- Right: (0, 5) is empty

The goal is at (2, 4), and looking at the empty spaces, I can see that I need to continue moving right and then find a path down to reach the goal. The empty spaces show a path going right and then down through (4, 2) to eventually reach (2, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move right to position (0, 5).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 5), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall (1, 5) is a wall
- Left: (0, 4) is empty
- Right: (0, 6) is empty

The goal is at (2, 4), and I need to find a path that will eventually lead me there. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that I should continue moving right to (0, 6), which will allow me to eventually connect with the path that leads down through (4, 2) to reach the goal area.

Therefore, I choose to move right to position (0, 6).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 6)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 6), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall (1, 6) is a wall
- Left: (0, 5) is empty
- Right: Wall

Looking at my current position and the goal at (2, 4), I realize I need to find a path that leads down. From here, I can see that I need to backtrack since I've reached a dead end at (0, 6). The correct path must involve going back and finding another route.

Therefore, I choose to move left to position (0, 5).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 5), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall (1, 5) is a wall
- Left: (0, 4) is empty
- Right: (0, 6) is empty

I need to continue backtracking since I've discovered that the path to the right leads to a dead end. Looking at the empty spaces again, I can see that I need to go back towards the left and try a different route to reach the goal at (2, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move left to position (0, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 4), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall (1, 4) is a wall
- Left: (0, 3) is empty
- Right: (0, 5) is empty

I need to continue backtracking since I've discovered that the path to the right ultimately leads to a dead end. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that I need to go back to where I started and try a different route. The path must involve going through the lower sections of the maze to reach (2, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move left to position (0, 3).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall (1, 3) is a wall
- Left: (0, 2) is empty
- Right: (0, 4) is empty

I need to continue backtracking to find the correct path to the goal. Looking at the empty spaces again, I can see that I need to go back to (0, 2) and then try going down through (1, 2), (2, 2), and then find a path that leads to (2, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move left to position (0, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Up: Wall
- Down: (1, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: (0, 3) is empty

Now that I've backtracked to (0, 2), I can see that I need to go down through (1, 2) and (2, 2), which will allow me to eventually reach the goal at (2, 4). The path through the upper part of the maze (which I just tried) was a dead end, so going down is the better option.

Therefore, I choose to move down to position (1, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 2), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Up: (0, 2) is empty
- Down: (2, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: Wall

Looking at the empty spaces and the goal position at (2, 4), I can see that I need to continue moving down to (2, 2). From there, I should be able to find a path that leads to the goal at (2, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move down to position (2, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Up: (1, 2) is empty
- Down: (3, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: Wall (2, 3) is a wall

Looking at the empty spaces and the goal at (2, 4), I can see that I need to go down to (3, 2) first, which will allow me to access the path through (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4) and eventually reach back up to the goal at (2, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move down to position (3, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (3, 2)

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, I can see that they form:

1. A general "U" shape, where the path goes down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side.

2. Here's a new maze with a similar U-shaped path:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (1, 6)

Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 5)

This new maze maintains the U-shape pattern where the player must go down one side (through the left vertical corridor), across a horizontal passage at the bottom, and then up the other side to reach the goal. The key difference is that the right arm of the U is positioned slightly differently, but the general U-shape pattern is preserved.
