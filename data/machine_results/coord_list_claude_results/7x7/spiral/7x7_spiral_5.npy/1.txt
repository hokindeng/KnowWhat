You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 2)
2. The goal is at (2, 4)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 2), I can see that:
- Up: (1, 2) is empty
- Down: (3, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: Wall

Since the goal is at (2, 4) which is to the right of my current position, I'll need to find a path that eventually leads there. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that going up to (1, 2) will give me access to a path that can lead to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move up to coordinate (1, 2).

My next move: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (1, 2), I can see:
- Up: (0, 2) is empty
- Down: (2, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: Wall

Since I need to get to (2, 4), and I can't move directly right due to walls, I need to find an alternate path. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that I need to go around the walls.

The best path would be to first go up to access the top row of empty spaces, which will allow me to move right and then down towards the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move up to coordinate (0, 2).

My next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), I can see:
- Right: (0, 3) is empty
- Down: (1, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Up: Not possible (outside maze)

Since I need to get to (2, 4), and I'm currently in the top row, I should continue moving right along the top row. This will allow me to eventually move down towards the goal position.

Therefore, I choose to move right to coordinate (0, 3).

My next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), I can see:
- Right: (0, 4) is empty
- Left: (0, 2) is empty
- Down: Wall
- Up: Not possible (outside maze)

Since I need to get to (2, 4), and I'm currently in the top row, I should continue moving right. This will allow me to eventually find a path down towards the goal position.

Therefore, I choose to move right to coordinate (0, 4).

My next move: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 4), I can see:
- Right: (0, 5) is empty
- Left: (0, 3) is empty
- Down: Wall
- Up: Not possible (outside maze)

Looking at the overall maze structure and the goal at (2, 4), I need to continue moving right and then find a path down. I can see that there are empty spaces at (2, 5) and (2, 6) which I might be able to use to reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move right to coordinate (0, 5).

My next move: (0, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 5), I can see:
- Right: (0, 6) is empty
- Left: (0, 4) is empty
- Down: Wall
- Up: Not possible (outside maze)

Looking at the maze structure, I can see that I need to continue to (0, 6) and then find a path that will lead down through (2, 6), (2, 5), and finally to the goal at (2, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move right to coordinate (0, 6).

My next move: (0, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 6)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 6), I can see:
- Left: (0, 5) is empty
- Down: Wall
- Right: Wall
- Up: Not possible (outside maze)

Now that I've reached the rightmost accessible position in the top row, I need to find a path down. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that (2, 6) is empty, which will allow me to move down to that position through the available path, and then move left through (2, 5) to get closer to the goal at (2, 4).

Since I can't move directly down from my current position due to a wall at (1, 6), I need to backtrack left and find another path down.

Therefore, I choose to move left to coordinate (0, 5).

My next move: (0, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 5), I can see:
- Left: (0, 4) is empty
- Right: (0, 6) is empty
- Down: Wall
- Up: Not possible (outside maze)

I need to backtrack further to find a path down. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that I need to go back to where there's a path that leads down through (1, 2) and (2, 2), which will then allow me to move towards the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move left to coordinate (0, 4).

My next move: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 4), I can see:
- Left: (0, 3) is empty
- Right: (0, 5) is empty
- Down: Wall
- Up: Not possible (outside maze)

I need to continue backtracking to find the path that leads down through (1, 2) and (2, 2). From there, I can work my way towards the goal at (2, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move left to coordinate (0, 3).

My next move: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- Left: (0, 2) is empty
- Right: (0, 4) is empty
- Down: Wall
- Up: Not possible (outside maze)

I need to continue moving left to reach (0, 2), where I can then move down through (1, 2) and (2, 2), which will give me access to a path towards the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move left to coordinate (0, 2).

My next move: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

- Right: (0, 3) is empty
- Down: (1, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Up: Not possible (outside maze)

Now that I've reached (0, 2), I can start moving down through the path that will lead me towards the goal. I need to go down to (1, 2), then to (2, 2), and from there I can access the path that leads to (2, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move down to coordinate (1, 2).

My next move: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

I need to continue moving down to (2, 2), which will then allow me to access the path that leads to the goal at (2, 4) through the empty spaces at (2, 5) and (2, 6).

Therefore, I choose to move down to coordinate (2, 2).

My next move: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape - starting from the top row, going down one side, and coming back up the other side.

Here's my new maze design that maintains this "U" shape pattern:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 2)

Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 5)

This new maze:
1. Maintains the "U" shape of connected corridors
2. Has a valid path from P to G
3. Is different from the original maze but has similar dimensions
4. The empty spaces form a clear "U" pattern - down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side
5. Includes some branching paths while maintaining the overall "U" shape structure
