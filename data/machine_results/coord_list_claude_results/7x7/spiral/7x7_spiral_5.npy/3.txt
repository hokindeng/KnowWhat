You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 2)
2. The goal is at (2, 4)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 2), I can see that:
- Up: (1, 2) is empty
- Down: (3, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: Wall

Since the goal is at (2, 4) which is to the right of my current position, I'll need to find a path that eventually leads there. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that I need to go up first to access the path that leads to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move up to position (1, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (1, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 2), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Up: (0, 2) is empty
- Down: (2, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: Wall

The goal is at (2, 4), and I need to find a path that will eventually lead me there. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that I need to go up to (0, 2) first, which will allow me to move right through the empty spaces at the top of the maze, and then come back down to reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move up to position (0, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 2), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Up: Wall
- Down: (1, 2) is empty
- Left: Wall
- Right: (0, 3) is empty

The goal is at (2, 4), and I need to find a path that will lead me there. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that moving right through the top row will give me access to a path that can lead down to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move right to position (0, 3).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall (1, 3) is a wall
- Left: (0, 2) is empty
- Right: (0, 4) is empty

The goal is at (2, 4), and I need to continue moving right to eventually find a path down to the goal. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that continuing right along the top row will eventually give me access to a path that leads to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move right to position (0, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 4), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall (1, 4) is a wall
- Left: (0, 3) is empty
- Right: (0, 5) is empty

The goal is at (2, 4), and I need to continue moving right to find a path that will eventually let me move down to the goal. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that moving right will give me access to a path that leads down to the goal through (2, 5).

Therefore, I choose to move right to position (0, 5).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 5)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 5), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall (1, 5) is a wall
- Left: (0, 4) is empty
- Right: (0, 6) is empty

The goal is at (2, 4), and I need to continue moving right to eventually access the path that leads to the goal. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that moving right to (0, 6) will allow me to connect to a path that leads down through (2, 5) and eventually to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move right to position (0, 6).

My next move coordinates are: (0, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (0, 6)
Goal: (2, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 6), let me analyze my possible moves:
- Up: Wall
- Down: Wall (1, 6) is a wall
- Left: (0, 5) is empty
- Right: Wall

Now I can see that I can access the vertical path that leads to the goal. Looking at the empty spaces, I can move down through (2, 6), then (2, 5), which will get me next to the goal at (2, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move down to position (2, 6).

My next move coordinates are: (2, 6)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, I can see that they form:

1. A "U" shape (or horseshoe shape), where there's a horizontal corridor at the top, a vertical corridor on the right side, and a connecting vertical corridor on the left side.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a U shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (2, 5)

In this new maze:
- The left vertical part of the U is formed by (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)
- The right vertical part of the U is formed by (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)
- The horizontal connection is through (2,5)
- The player starts at (2,2) and needs to reach the goal at (2,5)
- The path is still navigable but the U shape is more pronounced and symmetrical
