You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (0, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (4, 0)
2. The goal is at (0, 0)
3. I need to move through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 0), I can see that:
- Moving up is possible to (3, 0), which is an empty space
- Moving down, left, and right are not possible due to walls or maze boundaries

Since I need to get to (0, 0) and moving up gets me closer to the goal, I'll choose to move up.

My next move is to position (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (0, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (3, 0), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 0).

From my current position, I can:
- Move up to (2, 0), which is an empty space
- Moving down would take me back to where I came from
- Moving left or right isn't possible due to walls

Since moving up to (2, 0) gets me closer to the goal and is a valid empty space, I'll choose that move.

My next move is to position (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (0, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (2, 0), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 0).

From my current position, I can:
- Move up to (1, 0), which is an empty space
- Moving down would take me back to where I came from
- Moving left or right isn't possible due to walls

Since moving up to (1, 0) gets me closer to the goal and is a valid empty space, I'll choose that move.

My next move is to position (1, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (0, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (1, 0), I'm now just one step away from the goal at (0, 0).

From my current position, I can:
- Move up to (0, 0), which is the goal position
- Moving down would take me back to where I came from
- Moving left or right isn't possible due to walls

Since moving up to (0, 0) takes me directly to the goal, I'll choose that move.

My next move is to position (0, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape. The path starts at the bottom of the vertical line, goes up, and then turns right to form the horizontal part of the "L".

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an "L" shape but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (0, 0)

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the "L" runs along the leftmost column (x=0)
- The horizontal part extends three cells to the right at the top
- The path from P to G is straightforward: move up along the vertical corridor and then right along the horizontal corridor
- The shape is still clearly an "L" but it's more compact than the original maze
