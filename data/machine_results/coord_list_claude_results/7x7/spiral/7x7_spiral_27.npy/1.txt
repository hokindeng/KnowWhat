You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 3)
2. The goal is at (4, 0)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 3):
- Up: (2, 2) is empty
- Down: (2, 4) is empty
- Left: wall
- Right: wall

Since I need to eventually reach (4, 0), and I'm currently blocked by walls on the left and right, I should move up towards (2, 2) as this will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up: (2, 1) is empty
- Down: (2, 3) is empty (but this would be going backwards)
- Left: wall
- Right: wall

Since I need to reach (4, 0), I should continue moving upward as this will help me get closer to the goal. Moving up to (2, 1) will eventually allow me to access the path leading to (4, 0).

I choose to move to: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 1), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up: (2, 0) is empty
- Down: (2, 2) is empty (but this would be going backwards)
- Left: wall
- Right: wall

Since I need to reach (4, 0), I should continue moving upward to (2, 0). This will put me in a position where I can then move right towards the goal through the available empty spaces.

I choose to move to: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 0), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up: wall
- Down: (2, 1) is empty (but this would be going backwards)
- Left: wall
- Right: (3, 0) is empty

Since I need to reach (4, 0), and I can now move right towards the goal, I should take that path. Moving to (3, 0) will get me closer to the goal position.

I choose to move to: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 0), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up: wall
- Down: wall (3, 1) is a wall
- Left: (2, 0) is empty (but this would be going backwards)
- Right: (4, 0) is the goal!

Since I can see that (4, 0) is the goal position and it's directly to my right, this is the obvious choice for my next move.

I choose to move to: (4, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "Z" shape. The path starts at the top, moves horizontally to the right, then diagonally down and left through the middle, and finally horizontally to the right at the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 0)

This new maze:
- Has a clear "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces
- Maintains the 7x7 size
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
- The path follows the top horizontal part of the Z, then diagonally down, and finally moves horizontally at the bottom to reach the goal
