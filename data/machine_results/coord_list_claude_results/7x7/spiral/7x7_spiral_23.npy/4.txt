You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 5)
2. The goal is at (6, 4)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 5), I can see that:
- Moving to (4, 5) is possible as it's in the empty spaces list

Since the goal is at (6, 4) and I need to move downward and rightward to reach it, moving to (4, 5) is a good step in that direction.

I choose to move to: (4, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (4, 5), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 4).

From my current position, I can move to:
- (5, 5) which is in the empty spaces list

Moving to (5, 5) will get me closer to the goal position, as I need to eventually reach (6, 4).

I choose to move to: (5, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (5, 5), I need to reach the goal at (6, 4).

From my current position, I can move to:
- (6, 5) which is in the empty spaces list

Moving to (6, 5) will get me closer to the goal position. From there, I should be able to reach (6, 4).

I choose to move to: (6, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 5)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (6, 5), I need to reach the goal at (6, 4).

However, I notice a problem. The goal position (6, 4) is not listed in the empty spaces, and looking at the walls list, there appears to be a wall at (5, 4) blocking access to the goal. This means the maze is unsolvable - there is no valid path to reach the goal position.

I need to inform you that this maze appears to be impossible to solve as the goal position is unreachable from any direction due to the surrounding walls.

Should we try a different maze or is there something I'm missing?

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a spiral shape. The path starts from the outer edge and winds inward in a counterclockwise direction.

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with a solvable spiral pattern:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 5)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 3)

This maze:
- Maintains a 7x7 grid size
- Has a spiral path from the player to the goal
- Is different from the original maze
- Has a valid solution
- The empty spaces form a recognizable spiral pattern

The main difference is that this spiral turns clockwise (instead of counterclockwise), and both the start and end positions have been adjusted to make the maze solvable while maintaining the spiral shape.
