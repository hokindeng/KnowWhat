You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 5)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 5)
2. The goal is at (6, 4)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 5), I can see that:
- Moving to (4, 5) is possible as it's in the empty spaces list

Since the goal is below and to the right of my current position, and (4, 5) is a valid move that brings me closer to the goal, I'll choose to move to (4, 5).

My next move: (4, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (4, 5), I can see that:
1. I need to reach (6, 4)
2. Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to (4, 5), I can move to:
   - (5, 5) is available as it's in the empty spaces list

Since the goal is still below and to the right of my current position, and (5, 5) is a valid move that continues to bring me closer to the goal, I'll choose to move to (5, 5).

My next move: (5, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (5, 5), I can see that:
1. I need to reach (6, 4)
2. Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to (5, 5), I can move to:
   - (6, 5) is available as it's in the empty spaces list

Since (6, 5) is a valid move and will put me in a position adjacent to the goal at (6, 4), I'll choose to move to (6, 5).

My next move: (6, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (6, 5)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and possible moves.

From my current position at (6, 5), I can see that:
1. The goal is at (6, 4), which is directly to my left
2. Looking at the coordinates, (6, 4) is neither in the walls list nor in the empty spaces list, which means it's the goal position and I can move there

Since the goal is directly adjacent to my current position and is a valid move, I'll move to (6, 4).

My next move: (6, 4)

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. The empty spaces in the original maze form a spiral shape. The path winds inward in a counterclockwise direction from the outer edge towards the center.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a spiral pattern, but with a different layout:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 1)

In this new maze, the spiral is simpler and more compact, starting from the top and winding down. The player starts at the top of the spiral and needs to follow it down to reach the goal. While it maintains the spiral concept, it's distinct from the original maze in its specific layout and path configuration.
