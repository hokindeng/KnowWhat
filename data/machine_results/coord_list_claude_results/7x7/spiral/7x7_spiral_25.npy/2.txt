You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information:
1. I'm at position (5, 4)
2. The goal is at (0, 4)
3. I can only move up, down, left, or right through empty spaces

Looking at the adjacent positions from (5, 4):
- Up: (4, 4) is a wall
- Down: (6, 4) is a wall
- Left: (5, 3) is an empty space
- Right: (5, 5) is an empty space

To reach the goal at (0, 4), I need to generally move upward and find a path around the walls. Looking at the available moves, moving left to (5, 3) seems to be the better choice as it will help me find a path around the walls to reach the goal.

I choose to move to: (5, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (5, 3), my options are:
- Up: (4, 3) is a wall
- Down: (6, 3) is a wall
- Left: (5, 2) is an empty space
- Right: (5, 4) is an empty space (where I came from)

To reach the goal at (0, 4), I need to find a path that will eventually lead me upward. Since going back right isn't productive, and up and down are blocked, the best option is to move left to (5, 2), which should help me find a path around the walls.

I choose to move to: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (5, 2), my options are:
- Up: Empty space at (4, 2) is a wall
- Down: (6, 2) is a wall
- Left: (5, 1) is an empty space
- Right: (5, 3) is an empty space (where I came from)

Since I need to eventually reach (0, 4), and I can't go up directly from here, I should continue moving left through the available path. This should lead me to a path that will allow me to move upward.

I choose to move to: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (5, 1), my options are:
- Up: (4, 1) is a wall
- Down: (6, 1) is a wall
- Left: (5, 0) is an empty space
- Right: (5, 2) is an empty space (where I came from)

Following the same logic, I need to continue finding a path that will eventually allow me to move upward toward the goal. The only productive move available is to go left.

I choose to move to: (5, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (5, 0), my options are:
- Up: (4, 0) is an empty space
- Down: (6, 0) is a wall
- Left: No space (off the grid)
- Right: (5, 1) is an empty space (where I came from)

Now I finally have an opportunity to move upward! This should help me get closer to the goal at (0, 4). Moving up through the empty space at (4, 0) is clearly the best choice.

I choose to move to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (4, 0), my options are:
- Up: (3, 0) is an empty space
- Down: (5, 0) is an empty space (where I came from)
- Left: No space (off the grid)
- Right: (4, 1) is a wall

Continuing to move upward will get me closer to the goal at (0, 4). The path up through (3, 0) is clear and is the obvious choice.

I choose to move to: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (3, 0), my options are:
- Up: (2, 0) is an empty space
- Down: (4, 0) is an empty space (where I came from)
- Left: No space (off the grid)
- Right: (3, 1) is a wall

Continuing to move upward through the clear path will get me closer to the goal. Moving up to (2, 0) is the best choice.

I choose to move to: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (2, 0), my options are:
- Up: No space (there's a wall at (1, 0))
- Down: (3, 0) is an empty space (where I came from)
- Left: No space (off the grid)
- Right: (2, 1) is an empty space

I can't continue moving upward directly because there's a wall. I need to find a path around it. The only viable option is to move right into (2, 1), which should help me find a path to eventually reach the goal.

I choose to move to: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (2, 1), my options are:
- Up: (1, 1) is a wall
- Down: (3, 1) is a wall
- Left: (2, 0) is an empty space (where I came from)
- Right: (2, 2) is an empty space

Since I can't move up or down due to walls, and going left would just take me back where I came from, the only productive move is to continue right through the empty space at (2, 2). This should help me find a path that eventually leads to the goal.

I choose to move to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (2, 2), my options are:
- Up: (1, 2) is a wall
- Down: (3, 2) is a wall
- Left: (2, 1) is an empty space (where I came from)
- Right: (2, 3) is an empty space

Since I can't move up or down due to walls, and going left would just take me back where I came from, the only productive move is to continue right through the empty space at (2, 3). This should help me find a path that eventually leads to the goal.

I choose to move to: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (2, 3), my options are:
- Up: (1, 3) is a wall
- Down: (3, 3) is an empty space
- Left: (2, 2) is an empty space (where I came from)
- Right: (2, 4) is a wall

Looking at the available moves, I can't go up due to a wall, can't go right due to a wall, and going left would just take me back. The only new path available is down to (3, 3). This might seem like we're going away from the goal temporarily, but it might lead us to a path that will eventually get us to the goal.

I choose to move to: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (3, 3), my options are:
- Up: (2, 3) is an empty space (where I came from)
- Down: No valid move (wall at 4, 3)
- Left: No valid move (wall at 3, 2)
- Right: (3, 4) is a wall
- However, I notice (3, 5) is an empty space

Looking at the overall maze structure and our goal at (0, 4), we need to find a path that leads upward. Since we can't go directly up (that would be backtracking), and we're blocked to the left and right by walls, we should try to move to (3, 5) which might give us a path around these obstacles.

I choose to move to: (3, 5)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the pattern of empty spaces in the original maze:

1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape. Starting from the top row, there's a vertical path down the left side, a horizontal path at the bottom, and another vertical path up the right side.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a "U" shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1)

Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (0, 0)

In this new maze, the empty spaces form a clear U-shape along the left and bottom edges of the grid, with two vertical parallel paths connected by a horizontal path at the bottom. The walls block off the entire right portion of the maze, forcing the path to follow the U shape to reach the goal.
