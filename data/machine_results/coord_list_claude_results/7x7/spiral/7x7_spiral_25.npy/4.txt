You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information:
1. I'm at position (5, 4)
2. The goal is at (0, 4)
3. I can only move up, down, left, or right through empty spaces

Looking at the adjacent positions from (5, 4):
- Up: (4, 4) is a wall
- Down: (6, 4) is a wall
- Left: (5, 3) is an empty space
- Right: (5, 5) is an empty space

To reach the goal at (0, 4), I need to generally move upward and find a path around the walls. Looking at the available moves, moving left to (5, 3) seems to be the better choice as it will help me find a path around the walls to reach the goal.

I choose to move to: (5, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (5, 3), my options are:
- Up: (4, 3) is a wall
- Down: (6, 3) is a wall
- Left: (5, 2) is an empty space
- Right: (5, 4) is an empty space (where I came from)

To reach the goal at (0, 4), I need to find a path that will eventually lead me upward. Since going back right isn't optimal, and up and down are blocked, the best choice is to move left to (5, 2), which should help me find a path around the walls.

I choose to move to: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (5, 2), my options are:
- Up: Empty space at (4, 2) is a wall
- Down: (6, 2) is a wall
- Left: (5, 1) is an empty space
- Right: (5, 3) is an empty space (where I came from)

Since I need to eventually reach (0, 4), and I can't go up directly from here, I should continue moving left through the available path. This should lead me to a path that will allow me to move upward.

I choose to move to: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (5, 1), my options are:
- Up: (4, 1) is a wall
- Down: (6, 1) is a wall
- Left: (5, 0) is an empty space
- Right: (5, 2) is an empty space (where I came from)

Continuing with the strategy of finding a path that will eventually let me move upward, and since I can't go up directly from here, I should move to the left where there's an empty space.

I choose to move to: (5, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (5, 0), my options are:
- Up: (4, 0) is an empty space
- Down: (6, 0) is a wall
- Left: No space (off maze)
- Right: (5, 1) is an empty space (where I came from)

Now I finally have an opportunity to move upward! Moving up through (4, 0) will help me get closer to the goal at (0, 4).

I choose to move to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (4, 0), my options are:
- Up: (3, 0) is an empty space
- Down: (5, 0) is an empty space (where I came from)
- Left: No space (off maze)
- Right: (4, 1) is a wall

I can continue moving upward through the empty space, which will get me closer to the goal at (0, 4). Moving up is clearly the best choice here.

I choose to move to: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (3, 0), my options are:
- Up: (2, 0) is an empty space
- Down: (4, 0) is an empty space (where I came from)
- Left: No space (off maze)
- Right: (3, 1) is a wall

Continuing upward through (2, 0) is the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal at (0, 4). We'll need to find a path to move right eventually to reach column 4, but for now, moving up is the clear choice.

I choose to move to: (2, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (2, 0), my options are:
- Up: (1, 0) is a wall
- Down: (3, 0) is an empty space (where I came from)
- Left: No space (off maze)
- Right: (2, 1) is an empty space

Since I can't move up anymore due to a wall, and I need to eventually reach column 4, I should start moving right through the available path.

I choose to move to: (2, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (2, 1), my options are:
- Up: (1, 1) is a wall
- Down: (3, 1) is a wall
- Left: (2, 0) is an empty space (where I came from)
- Right: (2, 2) is an empty space

Since I need to reach column 4 and I can't move up or down, continuing to move right through the available path is the best option.

I choose to move to: (2, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (2, 2), my options are:
- Up: (1, 2) is a wall
- Down: (3, 2) is a wall
- Left: (2, 1) is an empty space (where I came from)
- Right: (2, 3) is an empty space

Since I need to reach column 4 and I can't move up or down, continuing to move right through the available path is still the best option.

I choose to move to: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (2, 3), my options are:
- Up: (1, 3) is a wall
- Down: (3, 3) is an empty space
- Left: (2, 2) is an empty space (where I came from)
- Right: (2, 4) is a wall

Since I can't move right anymore due to a wall, and I can't move up due to another wall, the only new path available is downward to (3, 3). This might help us find a path around the walls to reach the goal.

I choose to move to: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From position (3, 3), my options are:
- Up: (2, 3) is an empty space (where I came from)
- Down: (4, 3) is a wall
- Left: (3, 2) is a wall
- Right: (3, 4) is a wall

Looking at the available moves, I can only go back up to (2, 3) or find a new path. Since I can see that (3, 5) is an empty space and might provide a path around the walls to reach the goal, moving right to (3, 5) through the available path seems like the better option.

I choose to move to: (3, 5)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the pattern of empty spaces in the original maze:

1) The empty spaces form a rough "U" shape, with one vertical corridor on the left side, another vertical corridor on the right side, and a horizontal corridor at the bottom connecting them. The goal and player positions force navigation around this U-shaped path.

2) Here's a new maze with a similar U-shaped pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

Walls: (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)

This new maze maintains the U-shaped corridor structure but has:
- A slightly different wall configuration in the middle
- Different start and goal positions
- The same basic navigation concept of having to go around the U shape to reach the goal
- The same size as the original (7x7)
