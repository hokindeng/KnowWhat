You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (5, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 0)
2. The goal is at (5, 3)
3. I need to find a path through the empty spaces while avoiding walls

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 0), I can:
- Move up to (2, 0)
- Move down to (4, 0)
- I cannot move left or right as (3, 1) is a wall

Since the goal is at (5, 3), and I need to eventually move right and down, moving down to (4, 0) would be the better choice as it brings me closer to the goal's row position.

I choose to move to (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (5, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 0), let me analyze the possible moves:
- I can move up to (3, 0)
- I can move down to (5, 0)
- I cannot move left (wall at 6, 0)
- I cannot move right (wall at 4, 1)

Since the goal is at (5, 3), I need to eventually move right to reach that column. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that moving down to (5, 0) will give me access to a path through (5, 1) and (5, 2), which will get me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to (5, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (5, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 0), let me analyze the possible moves:
- I can move up to (4, 0)
- I cannot move down (wall at 6, 0)
- I can move right to (5, 1)
- I cannot move left

Since the goal is at (5, 3), and I'm already on the correct row (5), I need to move right to get closer to the goal column (3). Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that (5, 1) is available and will get me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to (5, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (5, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 1), let me analyze the possible moves:
- I can move left to (5, 0)
- I cannot move down (wall at 6, 1)
- I can move right to (5, 2)
- I cannot move up (wall at 4, 1)

Since the goal is at (5, 3), and I'm already on the correct row (5), I need to continue moving right to get closer to the goal column (3). Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that (5, 2) is available and will get me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to (5, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (5, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), let me analyze the possible moves:
- I can move left to (5, 1)
- I cannot move down (wall at 6, 2)
- I can move right to (5, 3) - this is the goal!
- I cannot move up (wall at 4, 2)

Since the goal is at (5, 3) and it's directly accessible from my current position, this is the obvious choice.

I choose to move to (5, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts at the top, goes down one side, curves at the bottom, and goes back up the other side.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a "U" shape:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)

Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (5, 3)

In this new maze:
- The left side of the U is formed by empty spaces going down from (0,0) to (5,1)
- The bottom of the U is formed by spaces at row 5
- The walls are arranged to maintain the U shape
- There's a valid path from P to G
- The overall dimensions are the same as the original (7x7)
- The shape is clearly recognizable as a U, though it's a different implementation than the original maze
