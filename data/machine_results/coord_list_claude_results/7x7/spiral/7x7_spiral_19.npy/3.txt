You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (5, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 6)
2. The goal is at (5, 6)
3. I need to find a path through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 6), I can see that:
- I can move to (4, 6), which is an empty space and gets me closer to the goal at (5, 6)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 6).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (5, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (4, 6), I can see that:
1. I'm one step closer to the goal at (5, 6)
2. The goal position (5, 6) is directly to my right

Since (5, 6) is the goal position and it's adjacent to my current position, I'll move there.

I choose to move to coordinate (5, 6).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape, with two vertical corridors connected by a horizontal passage at the bottom.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "U" shape pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)

Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (5, 6)

In this new maze:
- The left vertical corridor is along (1,2) to (1,6)
- The right vertical corridor is along (4,2) to (5,6)
- The horizontal connecting passage is at (4,2) to (5,2)
- The main difference from the original is that the middle section has more walls, making the U shape more pronounced
- There's still a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
