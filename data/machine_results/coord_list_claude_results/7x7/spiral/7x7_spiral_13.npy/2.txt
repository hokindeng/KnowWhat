You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (6, 2)
2. The goal is at (2, 1)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (6, 2):
- Up: (5, 2) is a wall
- Down: (6, 3) is empty
- Left: (6, 1) is empty
- Right: (6, 3) is empty

To get closer to the goal (2, 1), I should try to move generally upward and leftward. Since I can't move up directly due to a wall, I'll move left to (6, 1), which will give me more options for subsequent moves.

My next move: (6, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (6, 1):
- Up: (5, 1) is empty
- Down: No need to go down as it takes me away from the goal
- Left: (6, 0) is a wall
- Right: (6, 2) is empty

Since I need to get to (2, 1), I should continue moving upward. Moving up to (5, 1) is the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

My next move: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (5, 1):
- Up: (4, 1) is empty
- Down: (6, 1) is empty, but that's where I came from
- Left: (5, 0) is a wall
- Right: (5, 2) is a wall

The goal is above me, and there's a clear path upward through (4, 1), so this is the obvious best choice to continue moving towards the goal.

My next move: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (4, 1):
- Up: (3, 1) is empty
- Down: (5, 1) is empty, but that's where I came from
- Left: (4, 0) is a wall
- Right: (4, 2) is a wall

The goal is still above me at (2, 1), and there's a clear path upward through (3, 1), so this is the obvious best choice to continue moving towards the goal.

My next move: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), I need to make my final move to reach the goal at (2, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 1):
- Up: (2, 1) is empty and is the goal position
- Down: (4, 1) is empty, but that's where I came from
- Left: (3, 0) is a wall
- Right: (3, 2) is a wall

The goal is directly above me at (2, 1), so this is clearly the best and final move to reach the goal.

My next move: (2, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape, with two vertical corridors connected by a horizontal passage at the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "U" shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)

Empty: (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (1, 1)

This new maze:
- Has two vertical corridors on the left and right sides
- Has a horizontal corridor at the bottom connecting the vertical passages
- Forms a clear "U" shape
- Provides a valid path from P to G
- Has different wall placements while maintaining the same general structure
- Is the same size (7x7) as the original
