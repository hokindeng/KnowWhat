You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (6, 2)
2. The goal is at (2, 1)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (6, 2):
- Up: (5, 2) is a wall
- Down: (6, 3) is empty
- Left: (6, 1) is empty
- Right: (6, 3) is empty

To get closer to the goal (2, 1), I should try to move generally upward and leftward. Since I can't move up directly due to a wall, I'll move left to (6, 1), which will give me more options for subsequent moves.

My next move: (6, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (6, 1):
- Up: (5, 1) is empty
- Down: No need to go down as it takes me away from the goal
- Left: (6, 0) is a wall
- Right: (6, 2) is empty

Since I need to get to (2, 1), I should continue moving upward. The empty space at (5, 1) is available and will get me closer to the goal.

My next move: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (5, 1):
- Up: (4, 1) is empty
- Down: (6, 1) is empty, but that would take me away from the goal
- Left: (5, 0) is a wall
- Right: (5, 2) is a wall

The clear choice is to continue moving upward through (4, 1), as this brings me closer to the goal position.

My next move: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (4, 1):
- Up: (3, 1) is empty
- Down: (5, 1) is empty, but that would take me away from the goal
- Left: (4, 0) is a wall
- Right: (4, 2) is a wall

The obvious choice is to continue moving upward through (3, 1), as this brings me closer to the goal position.

My next move: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), I need to make the final move towards the goal at (2, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 1):
- Up: (2, 1) is empty and is our goal!
- Down: (4, 1) is empty, but that would take us away from the goal
- Left: (3, 0) is a wall
- Right: (3, 2) is a wall

The clear choice is to move up to (2, 1), which is our goal position.

My next move: (2, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "S" shape (or reverse "S" shape), with the path snaking from top to bottom in an S-curved pattern.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "S" shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (6, 1)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

In this new maze:
- The path still forms an "S" shape
- The start and end positions are different from the original
- The walls and empty spaces are arranged differently while maintaining the same general pattern
- The maze is still solvable with a clear path from P to G
- The overall dimensions remain 7x7
