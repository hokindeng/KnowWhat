You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (4, 6)
2. The goal is at (0, 2)
3. I need to move through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 6), I can see that:
- I can move to (3, 6) which is an empty space

Moving upward to (3, 6) seems like the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal position.

My next move: (3, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 6)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (3, 6), I can see that:
1. I can move to (2, 6) which is an empty space
2. I can move back to (4, 6) but that would be moving away from the goal

Moving to (2, 6) is the logical choice as it continues to bring me closer to the goal position at (0, 2).

My next move: (2, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (2, 6), I can see that:
1. I can move to (1, 6) which is an empty space
2. I can move back to (3, 6) but that would be moving away from the goal
3. I can move to (2, 4) through the empty spaces at (2, 4)

Moving to (1, 6) is the best choice as it continues to bring me closer to the goal position at (0, 2).

My next move: (1, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (1, 6)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (1, 6), I can see that:
1. I can move to (0, 6) which is an empty space
2. I can move back to (2, 6) but that would be moving away from the goal

Moving to (0, 6) is the best choice as it continues to bring me closer to the goal position at (0, 2). From there, I'll be able to move left through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

My next move: (0, 6)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (0, 6)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (0, 6), I can see that:
1. I can move to (0, 5) which is an empty space
2. I can move back to (1, 6) but that would be moving away from the goal

Moving to (0, 5) is the best choice as it continues to bring me closer to the goal position at (0, 2). I'll need to keep moving left through the empty spaces until I reach the goal.

My next move: (0, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

1. I can move to (0, 4) which is an empty space
2. I can move back to (0, 6) but that would be moving away from the goal

Moving to (0, 4) is the best choice as it continues to bring me closer to the goal position at (0, 2). I'll continue moving left through the empty spaces.

My next move: (0, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

1. I can move to (0, 2) which is the goal position
2. I can move back to (0, 4) but that would be moving away from the goal

Moving to (0, 2) is the final move that will take me to the goal position!

My next move: (0, 2)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "Z" shape. The path starts from the bottom right, moves horizontally left, then diagonally up and right, and finally horizontally left again at the top.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5)

Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (0, 2)

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 size as the original
- Contains a clear "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces
- Provides a valid path from P to G
- Has a different arrangement than the original maze while maintaining the "Z" shape pattern
- The "Z" is more symmetrical in this version, with equal-length horizontal segments at the top and bottom, connected by a diagonal middle segment
