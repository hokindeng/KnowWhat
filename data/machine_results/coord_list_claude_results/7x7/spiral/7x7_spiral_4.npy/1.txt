You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (5, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal position (2, 0) from the current position (5, 0).

Looking at the empty spaces and walls:
1. I'm currently at (5, 0)
2. The goal is at (2, 0)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I need to move upward to reach the goal

From my current position (5, 0), I can move up to (4, 0), which is an empty space.

My next move should be to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 0), I need to continue moving upward to reach the goal at (2, 0).

Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that (3, 0) is available and it's one step closer to the goal.

My next move should be to: (3, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 0), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (2, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I notice that I cannot directly move up to (2, 0) from my current position at (3, 0) because it's not listed in the empty spaces. Looking at the available empty spaces, I can see that I need to take an indirect route.

From my current position at (3, 0), I can move right to (3, 2) and then potentially find a path to the goal from there.

My next move should be to: (3, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a spiral shape. The path winds around in a clockwise direction from the outside towards the center.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a spiral pattern:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

This new maze maintains a spiral pattern but is simpler than the original. The empty spaces create a single curved path that the player must follow to reach the goal. The path starts at the bottom and curves upward, similar to the original maze's spiral pattern but with a different specific arrangement.
