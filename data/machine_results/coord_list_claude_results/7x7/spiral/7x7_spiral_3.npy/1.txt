You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the current position at (5, 5), I need to reach (6, 1). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering that I can only move up, down, left, or right:

1. I can see that I need to move towards the bottom of the maze and then navigate left to reach the goal.
2. From my current position at (5, 5), I can move to (4, 5) which is an empty space.
3. This will be a good first step as it moves me closer to a path that can lead to the goal.

Therefore, my next move will be to: (4, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), I need to continue making progress towards the goal at (6, 1).

Looking at the available moves:
1. I can move to (4, 3) which will help me get closer to the goal by moving left.
2. This is a good move as it opens up more paths to eventually reach (6, 1).

Therefore, my next move will be to: (4, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path creates a U-shaped corridor that starts from the top, goes down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a U-shaped corridor pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (1, 1)

In this new maze:
- The U-shape is more symmetrical
- The vertical corridors are along the right side and through the middle
- The horizontal corridor is at the bottom
- There's a valid path from P to G
- The overall dimensions remain 7x7
- The shape is clearly recognizable as a U while being distinct from the original maze
