You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (0, 1)
2. The goal is at (5, 5)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces while avoiding walls

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (0, 1), I can see that I can move to:
- (1, 1) which is an empty space

Moving to (1, 1) seems like the best first step as it begins to move me in the general direction of the goal (5, 5).

Therefore, my next move is to position (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

I can move to:
- (2, 1) which is an empty space
- (0, 1) which would be going backwards

Moving to (2, 1) continues to progress towards the goal (5, 5) and keeps options open for future moves.

Therefore, my next move is to position (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

I can move to:
- (3, 1) which is an empty space
- (1, 1) which would be going backwards

Moving to (3, 1) continues to progress towards the goal (5, 5) and maintains our forward momentum.

Therefore, my next move is to position (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

I can move to:
- (4, 1) which is an empty space
- (2, 1) which would be going backwards

Moving to (4, 1) continues to progress towards the goal (5, 5). From there, we'll be able to navigate upward through the empty spaces to reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to position (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

I can move to:
- (5, 1) which is an empty space
- (3, 1) which would be going backwards

Moving to (5, 1) is the best choice as it gets us closer to the goal (5, 5). From there, we can move upward through the empty spaces at (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), and finally to (5, 5).

Therefore, my next move is to position (5, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

I can move to:
- (5, 2) which is an empty space
- (4, 1) which would be going backwards

Moving to (5, 2) is the clear choice as it continues our path upward towards the goal (5, 5). We'll then be able to continue through (5, 3), (5, 4), and finally to (5, 5).

Therefore, my next move is to position (5, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

I can move to:
- (5, 3) which is an empty space
- (5, 1) which would be going backwards

Moving to (5, 3) continues our path upward towards the goal (5, 5). After this, we'll be able to move to (5, 4) and finally reach (5, 5).

Therefore, my next move is to position (5, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 4), let me analyze the available moves:

I can move to:
- (5, 5) which is the goal position
- (5, 3) which would be going backwards

Moving to (5, 5) will complete the maze as this is our goal position.

Therefore, my next move is to position (5, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "S" shape, with the path snaking from the top left, curving down and then back up to reach the goal.

Here's a new maze design that maintains an "S" shape but with slightly different wall placements:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)

Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

This new maze:
1. Maintains the same overall dimensions
2. Has a valid path from start to goal
3. Forms an "S" shape with its corridors
4. Has different wall placements while maintaining the general shape
5. Allows for movement through connected empty spaces from P to G

The main path still follows an S-curve, but with slightly different turning points and corridor widths compared to the original maze.
