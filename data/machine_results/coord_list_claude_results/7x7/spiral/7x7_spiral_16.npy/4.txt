You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can see that:
1. I'm currently at position (0, 1)
2. The goal is at (5, 5)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I need to avoid walls

Looking at the adjacent positions from (0, 1):
- Up: (0, 0) is a wall
- Down: (0, 2) is empty
- Left: Not possible (would be off the grid)
- Right: (1, 1) is empty

I need to generally move right and down to reach the goal at (5, 5). Looking at the available paths, moving right to (1, 1) seems to be the best option as it gets me closer to the goal while keeping future path options open.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position at (1, 1):

- Up: (1, 0) is a wall
- Down: (1, 2) is a wall
- Left: (0, 1) is empty but would be moving away from the goal
- Right: (2, 1) is empty

Looking at the overall maze structure and the goal position at (5, 5), I need to continue moving towards the right and eventually down. Moving to (2, 1) is the best option as it:
1. Gets me closer to the goal
2. Keeps me on a viable path
3. Avoids getting trapped by walls

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position at (2, 1):

- Up: (2, 0) is a wall
- Down: (2, 2) is a wall
- Left: (1, 1) is empty but would be moving away from the goal
- Right: (3, 1) is empty

Looking at the overall maze structure and the goal position at (5, 5), I need to continue moving towards the right and eventually down. Moving to (3, 1) is the best option as it:
1. Gets me closer to the goal
2. Keeps me on a viable path
3. Will allow me to eventually access the vertical corridor that leads to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position at (3, 1):

- Up: (3, 0) is a wall
- Down: (3, 2) is a wall
- Left: (2, 1) is empty but would be moving away from the goal
- Right: (4, 1) is empty

Looking at the overall maze structure and the goal position at (5, 5), I need to continue moving towards the right and eventually down. Moving to (4, 1) is the best option as it:
1. Gets me closer to the goal
2. Keeps me on a viable path
3. Will allow me to eventually access the vertical corridor that leads to the goal through (5, 1) and then up to (5, 5)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position at (4, 1):

- Up: (4, 0) is a wall
- Down: (4, 2) is a wall
- Left: (3, 1) is empty but would be moving away from the goal
- Right: (5, 1) is empty

Looking at the overall maze structure and the goal position at (5, 5), I need to move to the right and then up through the vertical corridor. Moving to (5, 1) is the best option as it:
1. Gets me closer to the goal
2. Positions me in the vertical corridor that will lead to the goal
3. Will allow me to move up through (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), and finally to (5, 5)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (5, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position at (5, 1):

- Up: (5, 0) is a wall
- Down: (5, 2) is empty
- Left: (4, 1) is empty but would be moving away from the goal
- Right: (6, 1) is a wall

Looking at the overall maze structure and the goal position at (5, 5), I need to move up through the vertical corridor to reach the goal. Moving to (5, 2) is the best option as it:
1. Gets me closer to the goal
2. Continues my path up the vertical corridor
3. Will allow me to eventually reach (5, 5) through (5, 3) and (5, 4)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (5, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position at (5, 2):

- Up: (5, 1) is empty but would be moving away from the goal
- Down: (5, 3) is empty
- Left: No empty space
- Right: (6, 2) is a wall

Looking at the overall maze structure and the goal position at (5, 5), I need to continue moving up through the vertical corridor. Moving to (5, 3) is the best option as it:
1. Gets me closer to the goal
2. Continues my path up the vertical corridor
3. Will allow me to reach (5, 5) through (5, 4)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (5, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position at (5, 3):

- Up: (5, 2) is empty but would be moving away from the goal
- Down: (5, 4) is empty
- Left: No empty space
- Right: (6, 3) is a wall

Looking at the overall maze structure and the goal position at (5, 5), I need to continue moving up through the vertical corridor. Moving to (5, 4) is the best option as it:
1. Gets me closer to the goal
2. Continues my path up the vertical corridor
3. Will put me just one step away from the goal at (5, 5)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (5, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position at (5, 4):

- Up: (5, 3) is empty but would be moving away from the goal
- Down: (5, 5) is the goal position
- Left: (4, 4) is a wall
- Right: (6, 4) is a wall

The goal is directly below my current position at (5, 5), and it's an available move. This is the final step needed to complete the maze.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (5, 5), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts at the top-left, goes down, moves right across the bottom, and then goes back up on the right side to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size that maintains a "U" shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6), (0, 6), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (5, 5)

In this new maze:
- The path still forms a "U" shape
- The walls are more concentrated at the top and sides
- The corridor is wider in the middle
- The start and end points maintain similar relative positions
- The path from P to G is still achievable through empty spaces
- The overall dimensions are the same as the original maze
