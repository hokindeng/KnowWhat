You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can see that:
1. I'm currently at position (0, 1)
2. The goal is at (5, 5)
3. I can only move through empty spaces
4. I need to avoid walls

Looking at the adjacent positions from (0, 1):
- Up: (0, 0) is a wall
- Down: (0, 2) is empty
- Left: Not possible (would be off the grid)
- Right: (1, 1) is empty

I need to make progress towards the goal position (5, 5), which is down and to the right of my current position. Both (0, 2) and (1, 1) are valid moves, but moving to (1, 1) will help me progress towards the goal by moving right.

Therefore, I choose to move to position (1, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position (1, 1):

- Up: (1, 0) is a wall
- Down: (1, 2) is a wall
- Left: (0, 1) is empty
- Right: (2, 1) is empty

I need to reach (5, 5), which is to the right and down from my current position. Since I can't move down due to walls at (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), and (1, 5), I should continue moving right through the available path.

Moving to (2, 1) will help me progress towards the goal while staying on a valid path.

Therefore, I choose to move to position (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position (2, 1):

- Up: (2, 0) is a wall
- Down: (2, 2) is a wall
- Left: (1, 1) is empty
- Right: (3, 1) is empty

I need to reach (5, 5), which is to the right and down from my current position. Since I can't move down due to the wall at (2, 2), and moving left would be going backwards, the best option is to continue moving right through the available path.

Moving to (3, 1) will help me progress towards the goal while staying on a valid path.

Therefore, I choose to move to position (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position (3, 1):

- Up: (3, 0) is a wall
- Down: (3, 2) is a wall
- Left: (2, 1) is empty
- Right: (4, 1) is empty

I need to reach (5, 5), which is to the right and down from my current position. Since I can't move down due to the wall at (3, 2), and moving left would be going backwards, the best option is to continue moving right through the available path.

Moving to (4, 1) will help me progress towards the goal while staying on a valid path.

Therefore, I choose to move to position (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position (4, 1):

- Up: (4, 0) is a wall
- Down: (4, 2) is a wall
- Left: (3, 1) is empty
- Right: (5, 1) is empty

I need to reach (5, 5), which is to the right and down from my current position. Since I can't move down due to the wall at (4, 2), and moving left would be going backwards, the best option is to move right.

Moving to (5, 1) will help me progress towards the goal, and from there I should be able to move down through the empty spaces at (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4) to eventually reach (5, 5).

Therefore, I choose to move to position (5, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position (5, 1):

- Up: (5, 0) is a wall
- Down: (5, 2) is empty
- Left: (4, 1) is empty
- Right: (6, 1) is a wall

I need to reach (5, 5), which is directly down from my current position. Looking at the path ahead, I can see empty spaces at (5, 2), (5, 3), and (5, 4) leading towards the goal at (5, 5).

The clear choice is to move down to begin making progress towards the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to position (5, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position (5, 2):

- Up: (5, 1) is empty
- Down: (5, 3) is empty
- Left: No empty space
- Right: (6, 2) is a wall

I need to reach (5, 5), which is still down from my current position. Looking at the path ahead, I can see empty spaces at (5, 3) and (5, 4) leading towards the goal at (5, 5).

The clear choice is to continue moving down towards the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to position (5, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position (5, 3):

- Up: (5, 2) is empty
- Down: (5, 4) is empty
- Left: No empty space
- Right: (6, 3) is a wall

I need to reach (5, 5), which is still down from my current position. Looking at the path ahead, I can see an empty space at (5, 4) leading towards the goal at (5, 5).

The clear choice is to continue moving down towards the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to position (5, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (5, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position (5, 4):

- Up: (5, 3) is empty
- Down: (5, 5) is the goal position
- Left: No empty space
- Right: (6, 4) is a wall

I need to reach (5, 5), which is directly down from my current position, and it's the goal! This is the final move needed to complete the maze.

Therefore, I choose to move to position (5, 5).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

(1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "S" shape. The path starts at the top, curves to the right, then back to the left, and finally curves right again to reach the goal, creating a distinctive S-shaped corridor pattern.

(2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming an S shape, but with a different arrangement than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)

Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (5, 5)

This maze maintains the S-shaped corridor pattern but with slightly different positioning of the walls and empty spaces. The path still requires the player to navigate through an S-shaped route to reach the goal, but the specific turns and corridor widths are different from the original maze.
