You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the path to the goal.

The current player position is at (6,3) and the goal is at (1,5). I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal.

Looking at the available moves from (6,3):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (5,3)
- Down is not an option (outside maze)
- Left is empty at (6,2)
- Right is empty at (6,4)

To reach the goal at (1,5), I need to generally move upward and to the left. Since I can't move up directly due to the wall, I'll first move left to (6,2) which is an empty space and will help me find a path around the walls.

My next move is to: (6,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6,2), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is empty at (5,1)
- Down is not an option (outside maze)
- Left is empty at (6,1)
- Right is empty at (6,3)

To reach the goal at (1,5), I need to move upward and to the left. Moving up to (5,1) will help me progress toward the goal by gaining elevation in the maze.

My next move is to: (5,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5,1), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is empty at (4,1)
- Down is empty at (6,1)
- Left is blocked by a wall at (5,0)
- Right is blocked by a wall at (5,2)

To reach the goal at (1,5), I need to continue moving upward. Moving up to (4,1) is the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal while staying on a valid path.

My next move is to: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,1), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is empty at (3,1)
- Down is empty at (5,1)
- Left is blocked by a wall at (4,0)
- Right is blocked by a wall at (4,2)

To reach the goal at (1,5), I need to continue moving upward. Moving up to (3,1) is the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal and maintains progress along a valid path.

My next move is to: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,1), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (2,1)
- Down is empty at (4,1)
- Left is blocked by a wall at (3,0)
- Right is empty at (3,2)

Since I can't move up directly due to the wall, and I need to reach (1,5), I should move right to (3,2) which will allow me to find a path around the walls to eventually reach the goal.

My next move is to: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,2), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (2,2)
- Down is blocked by a wall at (4,2)
- Left is empty at (3,1)
- Right is empty at (3,3)

To reach the goal at (1,5), I need to continue moving right and then up when possible. Moving right to (3,3) will help me progress toward finding a path to the goal.

My next move is to: (3,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,3), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (2,3)
- Down is blocked by a wall at (4,3)
- Left is empty at (3,2)
- Right is empty at (3,4)

To reach the goal at (1,5), I need to continue moving right as this seems to be the path that will eventually let me reach the upper part of the maze. Moving to (3,4) is the best choice.

My next move is to: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,4), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (2,4)
- Down is empty at (4,4)
- Left is empty at (3,3)
- Right is blocked by a wall at (3,5)

Looking at the maze structure, I need to find a way to get to (1,5). Since I can't move directly up or right, and going left would be backtracking, I should move down to (4,4) which might provide a different path to reach the goal.

My next move is to: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,4), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is empty at (3,4)
- Down is blocked by a wall at (5,4)
- Left is blocked by a wall at (4,3)
- Right is blocked by a wall at (4,5)

Looking at the maze structure and my goal at (1,5), I need to move back up since I've reached a dead end at this position. The path down didn't lead to a viable route to the goal.

My next move is to: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,4), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (2,4)
- Down is empty at (4,4)
- Left is empty at (3,3)
- Right is blocked by a wall at (3,5)

Since I've already explored the path downward and found it to be a dead end, and I can't move up or right, I need to try moving left to (3,3) to find a different route to the goal.

My next move is to: (3,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)

- Up is blocked by a wall at (2,3)
- Down is blocked by a wall at (4,3)
- Left is empty at (3,2)
- Right is empty at (3,4)

I've already explored the path to the right and found it doesn't lead to the goal. I need to try moving left to (3,2) to explore a different route that might lead to the goal.

My next move is to: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)

Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,2), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (2,2)
- Down is blocked by a wall at (4,2)
- Left is empty at (3,1)
- Right is empty at (3,3)

Since I've already explored the path to the right, and I need to get to (1,5), I should try moving left to (3,1) which might provide a new path to reach the goal.

My next move is to: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,1), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (2,1)
- Down is empty at (4,1)
- Left is blocked by a wall at (3,0)
- Right is empty at (3,2)

I've explored most of the paths on the right side of the maze and found they don't lead to the goal. Looking at the maze structure again, I notice that I might need to use the empty spaces at (1,1) through (1,4) to reach (1,5). Since I can't move up directly from here, I should try moving down to (4,1) which might provide a different path to reach those upper spaces.

My next move is to: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,1), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is empty at (3,1)
- Down is empty at (5,1)
- Left is blocked by a wall at (4,0)
- Right is blocked by a wall at (4,2)

I've already explored the path going up to (3,1) and found it doesn't lead to the goal. Let's try moving down to (5,1) to explore a different possible route.

My next move is to: (5,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5,1), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is empty at (4,1)
- Down is empty at (6,1)
- Left is blocked by a wall at (5,0)
- Right is blocked by a wall at (5,2)

I've been going up and down this left column and it's clear that this path isn't leading me to a solution. I need to reconsider my strategy. Let me go back up to (4,1) and try to find a different approach.

My next move is to: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,1), let me analyze the situation again:

Looking at the maze more carefully now, I notice that:
1. The goal is at (1,5)
2. There must be a path through the upper part of the maze
3. I've been exploring the left side without success
4. I haven't fully explored the possibilities through the right side

Let me try going up to (3,1) again, but this time with the intention of finding a different path through the right side that might lead to a way to reach the upper level of the maze.

My next move is to: (3,1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, I can observe that:

1. The empty spaces form a rough "U" shape, with:
- A vertical corridor on the left side
- A vertical corridor on the right side
- A horizontal corridor at the bottom connecting these vertical paths
- Some additional branches/extensions from this basic U shape

2. Here's a new maze with the same U-shaped pattern but slightly different arrangement:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,0), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,0), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,0), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,0)

Empty: (1,1), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,6), (3,1), (3,6), (4,1), (4,6), (5,1), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)

Player position: (6,3)
Goal: (1,5)

This new maze maintains the U-shape pattern but has a cleaner, more symmetrical design while still providing a valid path from P to G.
