You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the path to the goal.

The current player position is at (6,3) and the goal is at (1,5). I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal.

Looking at the available moves from (6,3):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (5,3)
- Down is not an option (outside maze)
- Left is empty at (6,2)
- Right is empty at (6,4)

To reach the goal at (1,5), I need to generally move upward and to the left. Since I can't move up directly due to the wall, I'll first move left to (6,2) which is an empty space and will help me find a path around the walls.

My next move is to: (6,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6,2), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is empty at (5,1)
- Down is not an option (outside maze)
- Left is empty at (6,1)
- Right is empty at (6,3)

To reach the goal at (1,5), I need to move upward and to the left. Moving up to (5,1) will help me progress toward the goal by gaining elevation in the maze.

My next move is to: (5,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5,1), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is empty at (4,1)
- Down is empty at (6,1)
- Left is blocked by a wall at (5,0)
- Right is blocked by a wall at (5,2)

To reach the goal at (1,5), I need to continue moving upward. Moving up to (4,1) is the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal while staying on a valid path.

My next move is to: (4,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,1), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is empty at (3,1)
- Down is empty at (5,1)
- Left is blocked by a wall at (4,0)
- Right is blocked by a wall at (4,2)

To reach the goal at (1,5), I need to continue moving upward. Moving up to (3,1) is the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal and maintains progress along a valid path.

My next move is to: (3,1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,1), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (2,1)
- Down is empty at (4,1)
- Left is blocked by a wall at (3,0)
- Right is empty at (3,2)

Since I can't move up directly due to the wall, and I need to reach (1,5), I should move right to (3,2) which will allow me to find a path around the walls to eventually reach the goal.

My next move is to: (3,2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,2), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (2,2)
- Down is blocked by a wall at (4,2)
- Left is empty at (3,1)
- Right is empty at (3,3)

To reach the goal at (1,5), I need to continue moving right and then up when possible. Moving right to (3,3) will help me progress toward finding a path to the goal.

My next move is to: (3,3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,3), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (2,3)
- Down is blocked by a wall at (4,3)
- Left is empty at (3,2)
- Right is empty at (3,4)

To reach the goal at (1,5), I need to continue moving right as this seems to be the path that will eventually let me reach the upper level where the goal is. Moving to (3,4) will help me progress toward finding a path to the goal.

My next move is to: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,4), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (2,4)
- Down is empty at (4,4)
- Left is empty at (3,3)
- Right is blocked by a wall at (3,5)

Looking at the maze structure, I need to find a way to get to the goal at (1,5). Since I can't move up or right directly, and going left would be backtracking, I should move down to (4,4) which might provide a different path to reach the goal.

My next move is to: (4,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4,4), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is empty at (3,4)
- Down is blocked by a wall at (5,4)
- Left is blocked by a wall at (4,3)
- Right is blocked by a wall at (4,5)

Looking at the maze structure and my previous moves, I realize I might have taken a wrong turn. The goal is at (1,5) and I'm currently in a position that doesn't lead to it. I should go back up to (3,4) and try to find a different route.

My next move is to: (3,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3,4), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (2,4)
- Down is empty at (4,4)
- Left is empty at (3,3)
- Right is blocked by a wall at (3,5)

Looking at the maze structure again, I notice that there's an empty space at (3,6). Since I can't go directly to the goal through (3,5), I should try to find a path that goes around. Moving right through (3,6) might allow me to reach the goal from a different direction.

My next move is to: (3,6)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, I can see that:

1) The empty spaces form a rough "U" shape, with two vertical corridors connected by horizontal passages at the bottom. The left vertical corridor leads to the goal position, while the right vertical corridor contains the starting position.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a "U" shape:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,0), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,0), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,0), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,0), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)
Empty: (1,1), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,5), (2,6), (3,1), (3,5), (3,6), (4,1), (4,5), (4,6), (5,1), (5,5), (5,6), (6,1), (6,5), (6,6)
Player position: (6,5)
Goal: (1,1)

This new maze maintains the U-shape corridor structure but with a simpler and more symmetrical design. The player starts at the bottom of the right vertical corridor and needs to traverse the bottom horizontal passage to reach the left vertical corridor to get to the goal.
