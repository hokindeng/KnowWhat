You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the path to the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (6, 3)
2. The goal is at (1, 5)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces while avoiding walls

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (6, 3), I can move to:
- (6, 2) - moving left
- (6, 4) - moving right

Since the goal is at (1, 5), which is in the upper part of the maze, I should try to move towards that direction. Moving left to (6, 2) seems like a better choice as it will help me find a path upward.

I choose to move to: (6, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (6, 2), I can move to:
- (6, 1) - moving left
- (6, 3) - moving right

Since I need to get to the upper part of the maze where the goal is, moving left towards (6, 1) seems like the better choice as it will help me find a path upward through the available empty spaces.

I choose to move to: (6, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 1)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (6, 1), I can move to:
- (5, 1) - moving up
- (6, 2) - moving right

Since I need to get to the upper part of the maze where the goal is, moving up to (5, 1) is the clear choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)

Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (5, 1), I can move to:
- (4, 1) - moving up
- (6, 1) - moving down

Since I need to get to the upper part of the maze where the goal is, moving up to (4, 1) is the clear choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)

Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 1), I can move to:
- (3, 1) - moving up
- (5, 1) - moving down

Since I need to get to the upper part of the maze where the goal is, moving up to (3, 1) is the clear choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)

Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 1), I can move to:
- (3, 2) - moving right
- (4, 1) - moving down

Since I need to get to position (1, 5), and there's no direct path upward from (3, 1), I should move right to (3, 2) which will help me find a path to the goal through the available empty spaces.

I choose to move to: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)

Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 2), I can move to:
- (3, 3) - moving right
- (3, 1) - moving left

Since I need to get to position (1, 5), and there's no direct path upward, I should move right to (3, 3) which will help me find a path that eventually leads to the goal. Moving left would just take me back where I came from.

I choose to move to: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 3), I can move to:
- (3, 4) - moving right
- (3, 2) - moving left

Since I need to get to position (1, 5), which is to the right and up from my current position, moving right to (3, 4) is the better choice as it brings me closer to the goal's column.

I choose to move to: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 4), I can move to:
- (4, 4) - moving down
- (3, 3) - moving left
- (1, 4) - moving up

Since I need to get to position (1, 5), and I can now see a path upward, moving up to (1, 4) is the best choice as it brings me very close to the goal. From there, I should be able to move right to reach (1, 5).

I choose to move to: (1, 4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the pattern of empty spaces in the original maze:

1) The empty spaces form a general "U" shape, with two vertical corridors connected by a horizontal passage at the bottom. The left arm of the U contains the goal (1,5), while the right arm contains the starting position (6,3).

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a U shape:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,0), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,0), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,0), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,0)

Empty: (1,1), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,6), (3,1), (3,6), (4,1), (4,6), (5,1), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)

Player position: (6,3)
Goal: (1,5)

In this new maze, I've maintained:
- The U shape with two vertical corridors
- The same overall dimensions
- A valid path from P to G
- Different specific wall/empty space arrangements while keeping the U shape recognizable
- The same start and goal positions

The main difference is that I've made the corridors slightly narrower and more uniform in width, while preserving the essential U shape that allows navigation from start to goal.
