You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (1, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best path to reach the goal.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (5, 6)
2. The goal is at (1, 6)
3. I need to move through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (5, 6), I can see that I can move to:
- (5, 5) which is an empty space

This seems like the logical first step to start moving towards the goal position.

I choose to move to: (5, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 5)
Goal: (1, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 5), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 6).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (5, 5), I can:
- Move up to (4, 5) - but this is a wall
- Move down to (6, 5) - but this is a wall
- Move left to (5, 4) - this is an empty space
- Move right to (5, 6) - this is an empty space, but I just came from there

Since I need to eventually reach (1, 6), and moving right would just take me back where I came from, the best option is to move left to (5, 4) which will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to: (5, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (1, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 6).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (5, 4), I can:
- Move up to (4, 4) - but this is a wall
- Move down to (6, 4) - but this is a wall
- Move left to (5, 3) - this is an empty space
- Move right to (5, 5) - this is an empty space, but I just came from there

Since I need to eventually reach (1, 6), and moving right would just take me back where I came from, the best option is to move left to (5, 3) which will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to: (5, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (1, 6)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 6).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (5, 3), I can:
- Move up to (4, 3) - but this is a wall
- Move down to (6, 3) - but this is a wall
- Move left to (5, 2) - this is an empty space
- Move right to (5, 4) - this is an empty space, but I just came from there

Since I need to eventually reach (1, 6), and moving right would just take me back where I came from, the best option is to move left to (5, 2) which will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to: (5, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 6).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (5, 2), I can:

- Move down to (6, 2) - but this is a wall
- Move left to (5, 1) - but this is a wall
- Move right to (5, 3) - this is an empty space, but I just came from there

Since I need to eventually reach (1, 6), and moving right would just take me back where I came from, the best option is to move up to (4, 2) which will help me progress towards the goal by moving upward.

I choose to move to: (4, 2)

Since (1, 6) is the goal position and it's directly adjacent to my current position, I should move right to reach it.

I choose to move to: (1, 6)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the pattern of empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts from the bottom right, goes left along the bottom, and then up along the left side to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "U" shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 6)
Goal: (1, 6)

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces form a clear "U" shape
- The path from P to G is valid and follows the U-shaped corridor
- The maze has different wall placements while maintaining the same general shape
- The start and end positions are the same as the original
- The overall dimensions are maintained at 7x7
