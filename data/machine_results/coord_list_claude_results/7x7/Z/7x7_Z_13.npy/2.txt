You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at (2, 5)
2. The goal (G) is at (4, 3)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the available empty spaces and considering my current position at (2, 5), I can see that:
- I can move to (2, 4) which is an empty space
- This would be a step in the right direction as it brings me closer to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to (2, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 3).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position:
- I can move to (2, 3), which is an empty space
- This would continue my progress towards the goal

Moving to (2, 3) will bring me closer to the goal while staying on a valid path.

Therefore, I choose to move to (2, 3).

My next move coordinates are: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 3).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position:
- I can move to (2, 2), which is an empty space
- I can also move to (3, 4), which would help me get closer to the goal position

Since the goal is at (4, 3), moving to (3, 4) would be more strategic as it brings me closer to the goal while maintaining a valid path.

Therefore, I choose to move to (3, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (3, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 4), I need to reach the goal at (4, 3).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position:
- I can move to (5, 3), which would get me closer to the goal
- This is a valid move as (5, 3) is in the list of empty spaces

Moving to (5, 3) will put me in a better position to reach the goal at (4, 3).

Therefore, I choose to move to (5, 3).

My next move coordinates are: (5, 3)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), with:
- A horizontal corridor at the top (2, 2) to (2, 5)
- A diagonal section connecting through (3, 4)
- A horizontal corridor at the bottom (5, 2) to (5, 5)

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different coordinates:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (5, 4)

In this new maze:
- The top horizontal part of the Z is at row 2
- The diagonal section goes through (3, 3) and (4, 2)
- The bottom horizontal part is at row 5
- The path maintains the Z shape while being distinct from the original maze
