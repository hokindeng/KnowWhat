You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (5, 3)
2. The goal is at (0, 2)
3. I need to move through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (5, 3), I can see that:
- (5, 2) is an empty space
- (5, 4) is an empty space

Since the goal is at (0, 2), which is above and slightly to the left of my current position, moving to (5, 2) would be the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (5, 2), I can see:
- (5, 1) is an empty space
- (5, 3) is an empty space

Since the goal is above me, I should try to move upward whenever possible. Looking at the coordinates, I can see that (4, 1) is an empty space that would help me progress upward.

Moving to (5, 1) would be the best choice as it will allow me to then move to (4, 1) in the next step, bringing me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (5, 1), I can see:
- (5, 0) is an empty space
- (4, 1) is an empty space

Since the goal is above me at (0, 2), moving upward would be the best choice. The empty space at (4, 1) will help me progress towards the goal.

I choose to move to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 1), I can see that (3, 2) is an empty space that would help me progress upward and slightly to the right, which is in the general direction of the goal.

While this move will take me slightly to the right when the goal is actually slightly to the left of my vertical path, this appears to be the only viable path forward given the wall configuration.

I choose to move to: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 2), I can see that (2, 3) is an empty space. While this moves me slightly further to the right, it appears to be the only viable path given the wall configuration.

The maze seems to require following a winding path to reach the goal, and (2, 3) is the next logical step in this path.

I choose to move to: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (2, 3), I can see that (1, 4) is an empty space. While this moves me further to the right, it appears to be the only viable path given the wall configuration.

The maze seems to require following a winding path that may loop around to reach the goal from a different direction.

I choose to move to: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (1, 4), I can see that (0, 3) and (0, 4) are empty spaces. Since the goal is at (0, 2), and I need to move left eventually, moving to (0, 3) would be better as it gets me closer to the goal position.

I choose to move to: (0, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), I need to reach the goal at (0, 2).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (0, 3), I can see that (0, 1) is an empty space. Since the goal is at (0, 2), and I need to move left, moving to (0, 1) is the best choice as it will allow me to potentially reach (0, 2) in the next move.

I choose to move to: (0, 1)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a spiral shape. The path winds from the bottom right area towards the center in a counterclockwise spiral pattern.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a spiral pattern:

Walls: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (0, 0)

In this new maze, the empty spaces create a spiral that starts from the bottom (where P is) and winds counterclockwise towards the center and up to the goal (G). The path is different from the original maze but maintains the spiral pattern characteristic.
