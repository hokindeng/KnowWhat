You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 4)
2. The goal is at (6, 4)
3. I need to find a path through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 4), I can move to:
- (3, 3) to the left
- (3, 5) to the right
- (4, 4) diagonally down

Since the goal is at (6, 4), which is to the bottom right of my current position, moving to (4, 4) would bring me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 4).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 4), I can see that:
- (5, 3) is available diagonally down-left
- There are no direct paths to the right or down as those are walls

Since the goal is at (6, 4) and I need to find a path around the walls, moving to (5, 3) would be the best choice as it keeps me progressing towards the goal while avoiding walls.

I choose to move to (5, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 4).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (5, 3), I can see that:
- (6, 3) is available directly to the right
- (6, 2) is available diagonally down-right
- (6, 5) is reachable but would take a longer path

Since the goal is at (6, 4) and I need to get to that level, moving to (6, 3) would be the best choice as it gets me to the right column, from where I can then move up to reach the goal.

I choose to move to (6, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 3), I need to reach the goal at (6, 4).

The goal is directly above my current position, and since we can move in any direction including diagonally, I can move straight up to reach it.

I choose to move to (6, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "Z" shape. The path starts from the top, moves horizontally to the right, then diagonally down to the left, and finally horizontally to the right again.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different positioning:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 4)

In this new maze:
- The path starts at the top with a horizontal segment
- Then moves diagonally down through the middle
- Finally extends horizontally at the bottom
- The empty spaces still form a recognizable "Z" shape
- The maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions as the original
- The path from P to G is valid and achievable through empty spaces
