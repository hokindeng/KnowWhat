You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 3)
2. The goal is at (6, 4)
3. I need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 3), I can move to:
- (3, 4) which is directly above my current position

Since (3, 4) is an empty space and it moves me closer to the goal position, this is the best next move.

I choose to move to coordinates (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 4), I can see the following possible moves to empty spaces:
- (3, 5) moving up
- (3, 3) moving down
- (4, 5) moving diagonally up-right

Since my goal is at (6, 4), I want to move generally towards the right and slightly down. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that moving to (4, 5) would be the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal while maintaining progress towards it.

I choose to move to coordinates (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), I can see the following possible moves to empty spaces:
- (3, 5) moving left
- (5, 4) moving diagonally down-right
- (6, 5) moving right

Since my goal is at (6, 4), and looking at the available empty spaces, moving to (5, 4) would be the best choice as it:
1. Brings me closer to the goal position
2. Moves me in both the right direction and slightly down towards the goal's y-coordinate (4)

I choose to move to coordinates (5, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 4), looking at the goal position at (6, 4), I can see that I just need to move one step to the right to reach the goal.

The coordinate (6, 4) is the goal position, and since I can move in any direction including diagonally to adjacent spaces, I can move directly to it.

I choose to move to coordinates (6, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation). The path starts at the top of the vertical line, goes down, and then turns right to form the horizontal part of the L.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that also forms an L-shape pattern, but with a slightly different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (6, 4)

In this new maze:
- The vertical part of the L is formed by the spaces at (3,3) through (3,5)
- The horizontal part of the L is formed by the spaces from (4,3) through (6,4)
- The path from P to G is still valid and follows the L shape
- The overall shape is similar to the original but with slightly different proportions
