You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 3)
2. The goal is at (6, 4)
3. I need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 3), I can move to:
- (3, 4) which is directly above my current position

Since (3, 4) is an empty space and it moves me closer to the goal position, this is the best next move.

I choose to move to coordinates (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 4), I can see the following possible moves to empty spaces:
- (3, 5) moving up
- (3, 3) moving down
- (4, 5) moving diagonally up-right

Since my goal is at (6, 4), I want to move generally towards the right and maintain a position that will allow me to reach the goal. Moving to (4, 5) gets me closer to the goal while keeping me on a viable path.

I choose to move to coordinates (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), I can see the following possible moves to empty spaces:
- (3, 5) moving left
- (5, 4) moving diagonally down-right
- (6, 5) moving right

Since my goal is at (6, 4), and I need to get there through the available empty spaces, moving to (5, 4) is the best choice as it:
1. Gets me closer to the goal
2. Positions me at a better height (y-coordinate) to reach the goal at (6, 4)

I choose to move to coordinates (5, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)
Empty: (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (5, 4)
Goal: (6, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 4), looking at the goal at (6, 4), I can see that I can move directly to it since (6, 4) is adjacent to my current position and is not listed in the walls coordinates (meaning it must be an available space).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (6, 4), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), starting from the top, moving diagonally down and then across.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different positioning:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (6, 4)

This new maze:
- Has the same 7x7 dimensions
- Contains a clear "Z" shape formed by the empty spaces
- Provides a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
- The "Z" shape is slightly wider and more pronounced than in the original
