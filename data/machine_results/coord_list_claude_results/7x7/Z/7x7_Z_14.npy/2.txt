You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 3)
2. The goal is at (0, 5)
3. I need to move through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 3), I can see that:
- Moving up would lead to (1, 4), which is an empty space
- Moving to (3, 2) is also an empty space
- The goal is generally in the upper-right direction

Since the goal is in the upper-right direction and (1, 4) is an empty space that gets me closer to the goal, I'll move to that position.

My next move is: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 4), I need to reach the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the available empty spaces around me:
- Moving up would lead to (0, 4), which is an empty space
- This is the best option as it gets me closer to the goal at (0, 5)

My next move is: (0, 4)

This will position me one step away from the goal, and I should be able to reach it in the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 4), I need to reach the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the goal position, it's directly to my right at (0, 5). However, I notice that (0, 5) is not listed in the empty spaces, which means I cannot move there directly. This appears to be a dead end, as I'm surrounded by walls except for the empty spaces behind me.

Let me reconsider the entire maze:
1. I'm at (0, 4)
2. The goal is at (0, 5)
3. Looking at the empty spaces available, there must be another path to reach the goal

I need to backtrack and find an alternative route. I'll move back to (1, 4) as it's an empty space and might lead to a different path to the goal.

My next move is: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 4), I need to find a different path to reach the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (2, 3)
2. I can move to (0, 4) (but I just came from there and know it's a dead end)

Since moving upward didn't work, and we need to find another path to the goal, I'll try moving to (2, 3) to explore a potential alternative route.

My next move is: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 3), I need to find a path to the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (1, 4) (but I just came from there)
2. I can move to (3, 2)

Since moving upward through (1, 4) and (0, 4) didn't work, and we need to find another path to the goal, I'll try moving to (3, 2) to explore a potential alternative route.

My next move is: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), I need to find a path to the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (4, 2)
2. I can move to (2, 3) (but I just came from there)

Since moving back through (2, 3) didn't lead to a solution, I'll try moving to (4, 2) to explore this new path.

My next move is: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), I need to find a path to the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (4, 1)
2. I can move to (4, 3)
3. I can move to (3, 2) (but I just came from there)

Since moving back through (3, 2) didn't lead to a solution, and (4, 1) would take me further from the goal, I'll try moving to (4, 3) which keeps me moving in a direction that might eventually lead to the goal.

My next move is: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), I need to find a path to the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (4, 2) (but I just came from there)
2. I can move to (4, 4)

Since moving back through (4, 2) didn't lead to a solution, I'll try moving to (4, 4) which continues moving eastward and might provide a path up to the goal.

My next move is: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 4), I need to find a path to the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (4, 3) (but I just came from there)
2. I can move to (4, 5)

Since moving back through (4, 3) didn't lead to a solution, I'll try moving to (4, 5) which continues moving eastward. This might eventually provide a path that lets us loop back up to the goal.

My next move is: (4, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), I need to find a path to the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (4, 4) (but I just came from there)

I notice that I've reached a dead end at (4, 5), as I'm surrounded by walls except for the path I came from. Looking at the overall maze structure and my previous moves, I realize I might have taken a wrong path.

Let's backtrack to (4, 4).

My next move is: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 4), I need to reconsider my strategy. I've explored the eastern path which led to a dead end.

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (4, 3)
2. I can move to (4, 5) (but I just came from there and know it's a dead end)

Since moving east didn't work, I need to backtrack further and try a different approach. Let's go back to (4, 3) and try to find another path.

My next move is: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), let me reconsider the entire situation.

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (4, 2)
2. I can move to (4, 4) (but I just came from there and know it leads to a dead end)

I've explored the eastern path which led to a dead end, and now I need to try going back west and possibly find a different route up to the goal. 

My next move is: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), let me analyze the situation again.

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (4, 1)
2. I can move to (4, 3) (but I just came from there)
3. I can move to (3, 2)

I've already explored the path through (4, 3) which led to a dead end. Moving to (4, 1) would take me further from the goal. The remaining option is to go back to (3, 2), which might allow us to find a different path to the goal.

My next move is: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), let me analyze the situation again.

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (2, 3)
2. I can move to (4, 2) (but I just came from there)

I've explored the path through (4, 2) which ultimately led to a dead end. The only remaining unexplored option is to go back to (2, 3), which might allow us to find a different path to the goal.

My next move is: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 3), let me analyze the situation again.

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (1, 4)
2. I can move to (3, 2) (but I just came from there)

I've explored the path through (3, 2) which ultimately led to a dead end. The only remaining option is to go back to (1, 4). Even though we tried this path before, we might need to explore it again but with a different approach to reaching the goal.

My next move is: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 4), let me analyze the situation one more time.

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (0, 4)
2. I can move to (2, 3) (but I just came from there)

At this point, I've explored most paths in the maze and keep coming back to the same positions. Let's review what we know:
- The goal is at (0, 5)
- We can't reach it directly as it's not in the empty spaces list
- We've tried paths through the bottom of the maze which led to dead ends
- We've tried going to (0, 4) before which also led to a dead end

However, looking at the empty spaces again, I notice we haven't fully explored the upper part of the maze. There are empty spaces at (0, 1), (0, 2), and (0, 3) that we haven't visited yet. Perhaps we need to try reaching the goal from a different direction.

Let's move to (0, 4) again, but this time with the intention of exploring those western spaces.

My next move is: (0, 4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)

1. The general shape formed by these empty spaces appears to be a "Z" shape (or reversed "S"). The path starts at the top, moves horizontally right, then diagonally down-left, and finally horizontally right again at the bottom.

2. Here's a new maze with the same Z-shape pattern but slightly shifted:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5)

Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (4, 5)

This new maze maintains the Z-shape pattern but is slightly different from the original while still providing a valid path from P to G.
