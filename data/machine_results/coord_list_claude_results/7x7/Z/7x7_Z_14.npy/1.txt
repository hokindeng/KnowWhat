You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 3)
2. The goal is at (0, 5)
3. I need to move through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 3), I can see that:
- Moving up would lead to (1, 4), which is an empty space
- Moving to (3, 2) is also an empty space
- The goal is generally in the upper-right direction

Since the goal is in the upper-right direction and (1, 4) is an empty space that gets me closer to the goal, I'll move to that position.

My next move is: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 4), I need to reach the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the available empty spaces around me:
- Moving up would lead to (0, 4), which is an empty space
- This is the best option as it gets me closer to the goal at (0, 5)

My next move is: (0, 4)

This will position me one step away from the goal, and I should be able to reach it in the next move.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 4), I need to reach the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the goal position, it's directly to my right at (0, 5). However, I notice that (0, 5) is not listed in the empty spaces, which means I cannot move there directly. This appears to be a dead end, as I'm surrounded by walls except for the empty spaces behind me.

Let me reconsider the entire maze:
1. I'm at (0, 4)
2. The goal is at (0, 5)
3. Looking at the empty spaces available, there must be another path to reach the goal

I need to backtrack and find an alternative route. I'll move back to (1, 4) as it's an empty space and might lead to a different path to the goal.

My next move is: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 4), I need to find a different path to reach the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (2, 3)
2. I can move to (0, 4) (but I just came from there and know it's a dead end)

Since moving upward led to a dead end, I need to explore the other available path. The only viable option is to move to (2, 3), which might lead to a different route to the goal.

My next move is: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 3), I need to find a path to the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (3, 2)
2. I can move to (1, 4) (but I just came from there and know it leads to a dead end)

Since moving upward through (1, 4) led to a dead end, I need to explore the other available path. The only viable option is to move to (3, 2), which might lead to a different route to the goal.

My next move is: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), I need to find a path to the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (4, 2)
2. I can move to (4, 1)
3. I can move to (2, 3) (but I just came from there)

Since moving back to (2, 3) led to a dead end, I need to explore the other available paths. Moving to (4, 2) seems like a good option as it opens up more possibilities with the connected empty spaces at (4, 3), (4, 4), and (4, 5), which might help me find a path to the goal.

My next move is: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), I need to find a path to the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (4, 1)
2. I can move to (4, 3)
3. I can move to (3, 2) (but I just came from there)

I can see that there's a line of empty spaces at row 4 leading to (4, 5). Since the goal is at (0, 5), moving towards the same column as the goal might be helpful. Therefore, I'll move to (4, 3) to continue along this path.

My next move is: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), I need to find a path to the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (4, 4)
2. I can move to (4, 2) (but I just came from there)

Continuing along row 4 towards column 5 (where the goal is located) seems like the best strategy. Therefore, I'll move to (4, 4).

My next move is: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 4), I need to find a path to the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (4, 5)
2. I can move to (4, 3) (but I just came from there)

Continuing along row 4 towards column 5 (where the goal is located) remains the best strategy. Therefore, I'll move to (4, 5).

My next move is: (4, 5)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 5), I need to find a path to the goal at (0, 5).

Looking at the empty spaces available:
1. I can move to (4, 4) (but I just came from there)

I've reached another dead end at (4, 5). Looking at the overall maze again, I realize I've explored most paths and haven't found a valid route to the goal. Let me backtrack to try a different approach.

I'll move back to (4, 4) and then we'll need to try a different strategy.

My next move is: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 4), I need to reconsider my strategy.

I've explored:
1. The path through (0, 4) which was a dead end
2. The path along row 4 to (4, 5) which was also a dead end

Looking at the empty spaces again, I notice I haven't fully explored the path starting at (4, 1). Since our previous attempts through other routes haven't worked, let's try moving towards (4, 1).

I'll move back to (4, 3) as the first step in this new direction.

My next move is: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), I'll continue moving towards (4, 1) to explore that path.

I'll move to (4, 2) next, continuing in the leftward direction.

My next move is: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), I'll continue moving towards (4, 1).

I can either:
1. Move to (4, 1)
2. Move to (3, 2)
3. Move back to (4, 3) (but I just came from there)

Since I've already explored the paths through (3, 2) earlier and found no solution, and moving right leads back to dead ends, I'll continue with my plan to explore the leftward path.

My next move is: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), I can see I've reached another dead end. Looking at all the paths I've explored:

1. The path through (0, 4) was a dead end
2. The path along row 4 to (4, 5) was a dead end
3. Now the path to (4, 1) is also a dead end

The only remaining option is to move back to (4, 2) and try the path through (3, 2) again, although we've explored that before without success.

My next move is: (4, 2)

However, I'm starting to think this maze might not have a solution, as we've explored all possible paths and found no way to reach the goal at (0, 5).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, I can now see that:

1. The empty spaces form a "U" shape, with two vertical corridors connected by a horizontal corridor at the bottom. However, there's a gap in the right vertical corridor (between the player's starting position and the goal) that makes the maze unsolvable.

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with a complete "U" shape that is solvable:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 1), (0, 5), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 5)

Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (0, 5)

This new maze has two clear vertical corridors connected by a horizontal path at the bottom, forming a complete "U" shape. The player can move up the left side of the U, across the bottom, and up the right side to reach the goal.
