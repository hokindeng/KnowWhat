You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm starting at position (6, 0)
2. The goal is at (1, 3)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces while avoiding walls

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (6, 0), I can see that (5, 1) is an empty space that would move me closer to the goal. Moving diagonally to (5, 1) would be a good first step as it brings me closer to the goal while staying on a valid path.

Therefore, my next move should be to: (5, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Looking at my current position (5, 1) and the available empty spaces, I need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 3).

From my current position, I can see that (4, 2) is an empty space that would help me progress towards the goal. Moving diagonally to (4, 2) is a valid move that brings me closer while staying on the available path.

Therefore, my next move should be to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), looking at the available empty spaces, I can see that (3, 3) is an empty space that would continue my progress towards the goal at (1, 3).

Moving diagonally to (3, 3) is a valid move that brings me closer to the goal while staying on the available path.

Therefore, my next move should be to: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), I need to reach the goal at (1, 3). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering that I need to avoid walls, I can see that moving to (2, 4) is a valid move that will help me progress towards the goal.

While this move appears to go slightly away from the goal horizontally, it's necessary to navigate around the walls and will ultimately allow me to reach the goal position.

Therefore, my next move should be to: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 4), I can see that I can move to (1, 4), which is an empty space. From there, I'll be able to get closer to the goal at (1, 3).

Moving to (1, 4) is a valid move that continues our progress towards the goal while staying on the available path.

Therefore, my next move should be to: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (1, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 4), I need to reach the goal at (1, 3). Looking at the available spaces, I can move directly to (1, 3) since it's adjacent to my current position and it's the goal position.

Therefore, my next move should be to: (1, 3)

This should complete the maze as we've reached the goal position!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "S" shape or "snake" pattern, starting from the bottom left, curving up and right, then back left towards the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains an "S" shape pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1)

Player position: (6, 0)
Goal: (1, 3)

This new maze:
- Maintains the same 7x7 dimensions
- Has a valid S-shaped path from P to G
- Has a different wall configuration than the original
- The empty spaces still form a recognizable S-shape pattern
- Allows movement through connected empty spaces from start to goal

RECOGNIZE: FAIL
