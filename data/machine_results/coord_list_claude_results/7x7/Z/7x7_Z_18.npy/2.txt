You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 1)
2. The goal is at (6, 3)
3. I need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (2, 1), I can see that (2, 2) is an empty space. Moving to (2, 2) would be a good first step as it:
1. Gets me into the main path of empty spaces
2. Moves me closer to the goal position
3. Is a valid move as (2, 2) is in the list of empty spaces

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 3).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position, I can move to (2, 3). This move would:
1. Keep me on the main path
2. Move me closer to the goal
3. Is a valid move as (2, 3) is in the list of empty spaces

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 3).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position, I can move to (2, 4). This move would:
1. Keep me on the main path
2. Allow me to eventually reach the goal through the available empty spaces
3. Is a valid move as (2, 4) is in the list of empty spaces

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 3).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position, I can move to (3, 4). This move would:
1. Start moving me to the right, which is necessary to reach the goal
2. Connect me to the path that leads towards the goal
3. Is a valid move as (3, 4) is in the list of empty spaces

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)

Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 3).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position, I can move to (4, 3). This move would:
1. Continue moving me to the right and slightly down, which is the direction of the goal
2. Follow the available path towards the goal
3. Is a valid move as (4, 3) is in the list of empty spaces

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 3).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position, I can move to (5, 2). This move would:
1. Continue moving me to the right and slightly up, following the available path
2. Keep me progressing towards the goal
3. Is a valid move as (5, 2) is in the list of empty spaces

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (5, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), I need to make my final moves towards the goal at (6, 3).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position, I can move to (6, 2). This move would:
1. Move me one step closer to the goal
2. Put me in position to reach the goal at (6, 3) in the next move
3. Is a valid move as (6, 2) is in the list of empty spaces

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (6, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 2), I need to make my final move to reach the goal at (6, 3).

The goal position (6, 3) is directly adjacent to my current position, and while it's not listed in the "Empty" spaces (because it's the goal), it is a valid move to reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (6, 3), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "S" shape. The path starts from the left, curves to the right while going down, then curves back to the left while continuing downward, creating a characteristic S-shaped corridor.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming an S-shape pattern, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

In this new maze, the S-shape is slightly more compressed horizontally but maintains the same basic curved pattern. The path still requires the player to navigate through an S-shaped corridor to reach the goal, but the specific coordinates of the walls and empty spaces have been rearranged while maintaining the overall shape and playability.
