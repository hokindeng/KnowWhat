You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 1)
2. The goal is at (6, 3)
3. I need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (2, 1), I can see that (2, 2) is an empty space. Moving to (2, 2) would be a good first step as it:
1. Is a valid empty space
2. Moves me closer to the goal
3. Opens up more possible paths through the maze

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 3).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position, I can move to (2, 3). This is a good move because:
1. It's a valid empty space
2. It continues my progress towards the goal
3. It will help me access the path that leads to the lower right section of the maze where the goal is located

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 3).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position, I can move to (2, 4). This is a good move because:
1. It's a valid empty space
2. It will help me get closer to (3, 4), which appears to be part of the path leading to the goal
3. It maintains my progress towards the goal while avoiding walls

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 3).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position, I can move to (3, 4). This is a good move because:
1. It's a valid empty space
2. It moves me one step closer to the goal horizontally
3. It connects to a path that appears to lead towards the goal through (4, 3)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 4), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 3).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position, I can move to (4, 3). This is a good move because:
1. It's a valid empty space
2. It moves me one step closer to the goal both horizontally and vertically
3. It's part of the path that leads towards the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 3).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position, I can move to (5, 2). This is a good move because:
1. It's a valid empty space
2. It moves me one step closer to the goal horizontally
3. Although it moves me slightly away vertically, it appears to be part of the path that will eventually lead to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (5, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (6, 3).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position, I can move to (6, 2). This is a good move because:
1. It's a valid empty space
2. It moves me one step closer to the goal horizontally
3. From there, I'll be just one step away from the goal at (6, 3)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (6, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (6, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 2), I need to make my final move to reach the goal at (6, 3).

The goal position (6, 3) is directly adjacent to my current position, and while it's not listed in the "Empty" spaces, as the goal position it should be accessible.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (6, 3), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "S" shape (or reverse "S" shape, depending on perspective). The path snakes from the top, curves down through the middle, and then curves back towards the goal.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming an S-shape pattern, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 5), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 5)

In this new maze:
- The path starts at the top and curves right
- Then it snakes down through the middle
- Finally, it curves back to reach the goal
- The overall S-shape is maintained but with different specific coordinates
- The path from P to G is valid and reachable through empty spaces
