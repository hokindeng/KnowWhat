You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 2)
2. The goal is at (6, 1)
3. I need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (3, 2), I can move to:
- (3, 1) - moving left
- (3, 3) - moving right

Since the goal is at (6, 1), and I need to eventually move down and to the right, moving to (3, 1) would be a better choice as it brings me closer to the goal's vertical position.

I choose to move to: (3, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), I need to continue making progress towards the goal at (6, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 1), I can move to:
- (3, 2) - moving right

Even though I just came from (3, 2), it appears to be the only valid move available from my current position. This will allow me to eventually access other paths that lead towards the goal.

I choose to move to: (3, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), I need to find a path that will eventually lead me to the goal at (6, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 2), I can move to:
- (3, 1) - moving left
- (3, 3) - moving right

Since moving left to (3, 1) would just lead me back to where I was before, and I need to make progress towards the goal which is to the right and down, I should move right.

I choose to move to: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), I need to continue making progress towards the goal at (6, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 3), I can move to:
- (3, 2) - moving left
- (3, 4) - moving right
- (4, 3) - moving down

Since I need to get to (6, 1), which is down and to the right of my current position, and going left or right on the same row won't help me make progress, the best move would be to move down.

I choose to move to: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), I need to continue making progress towards the goal at (6, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 3), I can move to:
- (3, 3) - moving up
- (5, 2) - moving diagonally down-left

Since moving up would just take me back where I came from, and I need to get closer to the goal which is down and to the right, moving diagonally down-left to (5, 2) is the better choice. This will help me make progress towards the goal's position.

I choose to move to: (5, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (5, 2), I need to reach the goal at (6, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (5, 2), I can move to:
- (4, 3) - moving diagonally up-right
- (6, 2) - moving down

Since moving back up to (4, 3) would be counterproductive, and I need to get closer to the goal which is at (6, 1), moving down to (6, 2) is the better choice. This gets me to the correct row (6), and from there I should be able to move left to reach the goal.

I choose to move to: (6, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (6, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 2), I need to reach the goal at (6, 1).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (6, 2), I can move to:
- (5, 2) - moving up
- (6, 3) - moving right
- (6, 1) - moving left

Since the goal is at (6, 1), and it's directly accessible from my current position by moving left, this is clearly the best move.

I choose to move to: (6, 1)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), starting from the top, moving right, then diagonally down to the left, and finally right again to reach the goal.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different positioning:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 1)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 1)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a "Z" shape, but the horizontal segments are shorter and the diagonal segment is slightly steeper. The path still allows movement from the player position to the goal while maintaining the same general shape concept as the original maze.
