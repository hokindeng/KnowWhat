You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 5)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

Looking at the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (6, 5)
2. The goal is at (0, 3)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

From my current position (6, 5), looking at the empty spaces around me, I can move to:
- (6, 4) - moving left
- (6, 6) - moving right

Since the goal is at (0, 3), which is towards the top of the maze, I should try to move in a direction that will eventually allow me to reach higher positions. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see there's a path that goes through (6, 4), which could lead to other empty spaces.

Therefore, I choose to move to (6, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (6, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 4), I can see that I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 3). Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position:

I can move to:
- (6, 3) - moving left
- (6, 5) - moving right
- (6, 6) - moving right

Since the goal is at (0, 3), I should continue moving in a direction that will help me get closer. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see there's a path through (6, 3) that could lead towards the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to (6, 3).

My next move coordinates are: (6, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 3). Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position:

I can move to:
- (6, 2) - moving left
- (6, 4) - moving right

Since the goal is at (0, 3), and I can see there's a diagonal path of empty spaces going up and left through (4, 2), (3, 3), etc., I should move towards that path.

Therefore, I choose to move to (6, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (6, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 3). Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position:

I can move to:
- (6, 1) - moving left
- (6, 3) - moving right
- (4, 2) - moving diagonally up-left

Since the goal is at (0, 3), and I can see there's a diagonal path of empty spaces going up through (4, 2), (3, 3), etc., I should move to that path.

Therefore, I choose to move to (4, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (4, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a zigzag or staircase pattern. The path creates a diagonal line that steps down and right (or up and left when solving from P to G), with some additional branches.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a zigzag/staircase pattern but with a slightly different arrangement:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Player position: (6, 6)
Goal: (0, 6)

In this new maze, I've maintained the zigzag/staircase pattern but shifted it slightly. The path still creates a similar diagonal stepping pattern from bottom to top, but with the start and goal positions moved to different corners. The overall shape is still recognizable as a zigzag/staircase, but it's not an exact copy of the original maze.
