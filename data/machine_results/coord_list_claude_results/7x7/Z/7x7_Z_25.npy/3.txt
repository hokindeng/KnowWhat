You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 5)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

Looking at the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (6, 5)
2. The goal is at (0, 3)
3. I need to find a path through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at my current position (6, 5), I can see that I can move to:
- (6, 4) which is an empty space
- (6, 6) which is an empty space

Since the goal is at (0, 3), which is towards the top of the maze, I should try to move upward and leftward when possible. Between the two possible moves, (6, 4) is better as it moves me closer to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to (6, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (6, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 4)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 4), I can see that I can move to:
- (6, 3) which is an empty space
- (6, 5) which is an empty space
- (6, 6) which is an empty space

Since I need to reach (0, 3), I should continue moving upward and leftward when possible. The best option is to move to (6, 3) as it brings me closer to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to (6, 3).

My next move coordinates are: (6, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 3)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 3), I can see that I can move to:
- (6, 2) which is an empty space
- (6, 4) which is an empty space

Looking at the empty spaces and the goal position (0, 3), I need to continue moving upward and leftward. Moving to (6, 2) is the better choice as it keeps me progressing towards the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to (6, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (6, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (6, 2)
Goal: (0, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (6, 2), I can see that I can move to:
- (6, 1) which is an empty space
- (6, 3) which is an empty space
- (4, 2) which is an empty space

Looking at the empty spaces and analyzing the path to the goal (0, 3), I can see that moving to (4, 2) would be the best choice as it:
1. Moves me upward and leftward towards the goal
2. Connects to a path of empty spaces that seems to lead towards the goal through (3, 3)

Therefore, I choose to move to (4, 2).

My next move coordinates are: (4, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the pattern of empty spaces in the original maze, they form a spiral shape. The path winds from the outer edge inward in a counterclockwise direction.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a spiral pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)

Empty: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 6)

Player position: (0, 6)
Goal: (6, 6)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a spiral pattern, but it spirals clockwise from the top-right to the center and then out to the bottom-right. The path is valid and can be traversed from P to G through the empty spaces.
