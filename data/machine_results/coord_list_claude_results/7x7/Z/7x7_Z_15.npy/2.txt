You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

Looking at the current state:
- I'm at position (4, 2)
- The goal is at (5, 4)
- I need to move towards the goal while staying on empty spaces

From my current position (4, 2), looking at the adjacent empty spaces:
- I can move to (5, 2), which is an empty space
- This would get me closer to the goal position

Moving to (5, 2) would be a good step as it:
1. Is a valid empty space
2. Gets me closer to the goal
3. Maintains flexibility for future moves

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (5, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 2)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

From my current position (5, 2), I need to reach the goal at (5, 4).
Looking at the adjacent empty spaces:
- I can move to (5, 3), which is an empty space
- This would get me closer to the goal position by moving one step right

Moving to (5, 3) would be the best choice because:
1. It's a valid empty space
2. It gets me closer to the goal
3. It's on the same row as the goal, just one step closer to it

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (5, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (5, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and determine the best next move.

From my current position (5, 3), I need to reach the goal at (5, 4).
Looking at the adjacent empty spaces:
- The goal position (5, 4) is directly adjacent to my current position
- I can move directly to the goal

Since I can reach the goal in one move, I'll move to (5, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (5, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), starting from the top left, moving diagonally down to the right, and then extending to the right at the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different wall placements:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (5, 3)

In this new maze:
- The empty spaces still form a "Z" shape
- The path starts from the top and zigzags down to the bottom right
- The maze has different wall placements while maintaining the same overall size
- There is a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The "Z" shape is still clearly recognizable in the pattern of empty spaces
