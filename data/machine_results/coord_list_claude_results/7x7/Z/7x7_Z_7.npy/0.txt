You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 4)
2. The goal is at (4, 2)
3. I need to move through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 4), and considering that I need to move towards the goal which is down and to the right, I can see that:
- I can move to (2, 3), which is an empty space
- This would be a good first step as it brings me closer to the goal while staying on a valid path

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 2).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position:
- I can move to (2, 2), which is an empty space
- I can move to (3, 3), which is also an empty space

Since the goal is at (4, 2), moving to (3, 3) would be the better choice as it brings me closer to the goal while maintaining a valid path. From there, I'll be able to continue moving towards the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 2).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position and considering that I need to reach (4, 2):
- I can move back to (2, 3), but that would take me away from the goal
- I can move to (2, 2), which would be a good step as it gets me closer to the goal position

Since the goal is at (4, 2) and there appears to be a wall blocking direct access, I need to take a path around. Moving to (2, 2) will help me navigate around the obstacles to reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 2).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position:
- I can move to (2, 1), which is an empty space
- I can move back to (2, 3) or (3, 3), but those would take me away from a good path

Since I need to reach (4, 2) and there are walls blocking direct access, I need to find a path around. Moving to (2, 1) will allow me to potentially navigate around the obstacles to reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 1)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 2).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position:
- I can move to (2, 0), which is an empty space
- I can move back to (2, 2), but that would be backtracking

Since I need to reach (4, 2) and there are walls blocking the direct path, I need to find a way around. Moving to (2, 0) will allow me to potentially find a path that goes around the bottom of the maze to reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (4, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 0), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (4, 2).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my position:
- I can move to (6, 0), which is an empty space
- I can move back to (2, 1), but that would be backtracking

Since I need to reach (4, 2) and there are walls blocking more direct paths, moving to (6, 0) seems like the best option. This will allow me to use the path that appears to go along the bottom of the maze and then up towards the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (6, 0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, I can see that they form:

1. The shape of the letter "J"

The empty spaces start at the top, go down, and then curve to the right at the bottom, forming a hook shape characteristic of the letter J.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a J shape:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (6, 2)

This new maze maintains the J-shape of the corridors but has a different arrangement of walls while still providing a valid path from P to G. The vertical part of the J is slightly wider than in the original, but the characteristic hook shape is preserved.
