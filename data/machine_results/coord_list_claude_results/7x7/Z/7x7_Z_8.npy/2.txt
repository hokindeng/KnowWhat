You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (4, 0)
2. The goal is at (2, 2)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces available and my current position (4, 0), I can see that:
- I can move to (4, 1), which is an empty space
- I can also move diagonally to (3, 1), which is an empty space

Since the goal is at (2, 2), moving to (3, 1) would be a better choice as it brings me closer to the goal position.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (2, 2)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (2, 2).

Looking at the available empty spaces and considering my current position, I can see that:
1. I can move diagonally up-right to (2, 2), which is the goal position
2. I can move to other empty spaces, but moving to (2, 2) is the best choice as it's directly accessible and is our goal

Since I can reach the goal position directly from my current position with a diagonal move, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 2).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "L" shape (or reversed "L" shape, depending on orientation). The empty spaces create two perpendicular corridors that meet at a right angle.

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with empty spaces forming an "L" shape, but with a different orientation and position than the original:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (1, 1)

In this new maze, the "L" shape is formed by a vertical corridor along x=1, with the player starting at the bottom and the goal at the top. The path is still navigable, and the general "L" shape is maintained while being distinct from the original maze.
