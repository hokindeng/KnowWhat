You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)
Player position: (4, 6)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (4, 6)
2. The goal is at (1, 5)
3. I need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 6), I can see that:
- (4, 5) is an empty space
- Moving to (4, 5) would get me closer to the goal position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6)
Player position: (4, 5)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (4, 5), I can see that:
1. I need to move towards the goal at (1, 5)
2. Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my position:
   - (4, 4) is an empty space
   - (3, 4) is also an empty space
   - Moving to (3, 4) would get me closer to the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (3, 4), I can see that:
1. The goal is at (1, 5)
2. Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my position:
   - (2, 5) is an empty space
   - Moving to (2, 5) would get me closer to the goal and provide a path towards (1, 5)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (1, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (2, 5), I can see that:
1. The goal is at (1, 5), which is directly adjacent to my current position
2. I can move directly to the goal position since it's just one step away

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 5), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), with one vertical segment at the right side, a diagonal segment in the middle, and another vertical segment at the left side.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) that maintains a "Z" shape pattern but with slightly different positioning:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (1, 5)

In this new maze:
- The path still forms a "Z" shape
- The right vertical segment is at coordinates (5,1) to (4,1)
- The diagonal segment runs from (4,2) through (3,2) to (2,4)
- The left vertical segment runs from (2,4) to (1,5)
- There's a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
- The overall shape is similar to the original but positioned slightly differently in the grid
