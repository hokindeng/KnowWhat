You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (5, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (5, 1)
2. The goal is at (1, 0)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces while avoiding walls

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position (5, 1), I can move to:
- (4, 1) - moving up
- (5, 0) - moving left
- (5, 2) - moving right

Since the goal is at (1, 0), which is in the upper-left portion of the maze, moving upward would bring me closer to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 1), I can see:
- (3, 2) - moving up and right
- (5, 1) - moving down (where I came from)
- (5, 0) - moving down and left
- (5, 2) - moving down and right

Since I need to get to (1, 0), which is in the upper-left portion of the maze, and I can see that (3, 2) is the only upward option available, I should move to (3, 2). This will help me progress towards the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to (3, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
Player position: (3, 2)
Goal: (1, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (1, 0).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 2), I can see:
- (2, 3) - moving up and right
- (1, 2) - moving up
- (4, 1) - moving down and left (where I came from)

Since I need to get to (1, 0), and I can see that moving up through (1, 2) will bring me closer to the goal, this seems like the best option. Moving to (2, 3) would take me further right, away from our target.

Therefore, I choose to move to (1, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "Z" shape (or zigzag pattern), starting from the top left, moving right, then diagonally down to the left, and finally extending right again at the bottom.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (5, 5)

In this new maze, the empty spaces still form a "Z" shape, but:
- The Z is slightly more compressed horizontally
- The diagonal portion of the Z is more pronounced
- The start and end points are positioned differently
- The overall path follows the same basic Z pattern: horizontal at top, diagonal down, horizontal at bottom
- There's a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces
