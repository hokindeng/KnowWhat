You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (3, 1)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (3, 1)
2. The goal is at (0, 4)
3. I need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (3, 1), I can move to:
- (3, 2) which is an empty space
- (2, 2) which is an empty space

Moving to (2, 2) would get me closer to the goal position (0, 4), as it moves me upward in the maze.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 2), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 4).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (2, 2), I can move to:
- (3, 2) which is an empty space
- (1, 3) which is an empty space

Moving to (1, 3) would get me closer to the goal position (0, 4), as it moves me upward and rightward in the maze.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 4).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (1, 3), I can move to:
- (0, 3) which is an empty space

Moving to (0, 3) would get me closer to the goal position (0, 4), as it moves me upward in the maze and puts me in position to reach the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), I need to reach the goal at (0, 4).

Looking at my current position and the goal position, I can see that the goal is directly to my right at (0, 4). However, checking the available empty spaces, I notice that (0, 4) is not listed in the empty spaces, which means I cannot move there directly.

Looking at the available empty spaces from my current position (0, 3), I can move to:
- (0, 2) which is an empty space
- (0, 1) which is an empty space

Since I cannot reach the goal directly, and there appears to be no valid path to (0, 4), I must inform you that the maze appears to be unsolvable. The goal position at (0, 4) is not accessible from any of the empty spaces in the maze.

Would you like me to verify if this is correct, or should I try a different approach?

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), I can see that they form:

1. The general shape is a "Z" (or reversed "S")

2. Here's a new 7x7 maze with a "Z" shape that provides a valid path from P to G:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (0, 1)

This new maze maintains a "Z" shape for its corridors but is different from the original, and provides a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces.
