You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (0, 4)
2. The goal is at (3, 4)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (0, 4), I can move to:
- (0, 3) to the left
- (0, 5) to the right
- (1, 4) downward

Since the goal is at (3, 4), which is below my current position, moving downward towards it would be the most direct route.

Therefore, I choose to move to (1, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (1, 4), looking at the empty spaces around me, I can see:
- I can move to (2, 3) diagonally down-left
- I can move back to (0, 4) upward, but that would be moving away from the goal

Since the goal is at (3, 4), and I need to continue moving downward, the best move would be to go to (2, 3), which will help me get closer to the goal while staying on valid empty spaces.

Therefore, I choose to move to (2, 3).

My next move coordinates are: (2, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (2, 3), looking at the empty spaces around me, I can see:
- I can move to (3, 3) directly to the right
- I can move to (3, 2) diagonally down-right

Since the goal is at (3, 4), and I need to eventually move right and then up to reach it, moving to (3, 3) would be the best choice. This puts me in a better position to reach the goal at (3, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move to (3, 3).

My next move coordinates are: (3, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 5)
Player position: (3, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

From my current position at (3, 3), looking at the empty spaces around me, I can see that I need to reach the goal at (3, 4), which is directly to my right.

Since (3, 4) is the goal position and it's adjacent to my current position, I can move there directly.

Therefore, I choose to move to (3, 4).

My next move coordinates are: (3, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "Z" shape. The path starts at the top, moves horizontally to the right, then diagonally down to the left, and finally horizontally to the right again.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) with empty spaces forming a "Z" shape, but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 1), (6, 1)

Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (6, 1)

In this new maze:
- The top horizontal line of the Z is formed by the path from (0,3) to (4,3)
- The diagonal part goes from (4,3) to (5,1)
- The bottom horizontal line is at (5,1) to (6,1)
- The path is still continuous and solvable
- The overall Z shape is maintained but rotated slightly compared to the original
