You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 2)
2. The goal is at (0, 4)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 2), I can see that:
- Position (1, 3) is an empty space
- Position (3, 1) is an empty space

To get closer to the goal at (0, 4), moving towards position (1, 3) would be more beneficial as it brings me closer to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 4).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (1, 3):
- Position (0, 3) is an empty space
- Moving to (0, 3) would get me closer to the goal at (0, 4)

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (0, 3).

This move will position me just one step away from the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), I can see that the goal at (0, 4) is directly adjacent to my position. However, looking at the coordinates, I notice that (0, 4) is not listed in either the "Walls" or "Empty" spaces. This means it must be the goal position and I should be able to move there.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (0, 4), which is the goal position.

This should complete the maze!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "7" shape. The vertical line of the "7" runs from (4,0) to (4,4), and the horizontal line runs from (0,3) to (4,3), with a few additional connecting spaces.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) where the empty spaces also form a "7" shape, but with slightly different positioning:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3)

Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (4, 4)

In this new maze, the "7" shape is formed by:
- A horizontal line from (0,2) to (4,2)
- A vertical line from (4,2) to (4,4)
The path from P to G follows this "7" shape, and the maze maintains the same 7x7 dimensions as the original.
