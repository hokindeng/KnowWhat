You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 2)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given information, I can visualize that:
1. I'm currently at position (2, 2)
2. The goal is at (0, 4)
3. I need to navigate through empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around my current position (2, 2), I can see that:
- Position (1, 3) is an empty space
- Position (3, 1) is an empty space

To get closer to the goal at (0, 4), I should try to move upward and to the right. The position (1, 3) would be a good next move as it:
1. Is an empty space
2. Gets me closer to the goal
3. Is adjacent to my current position

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (1, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 3), I need to continue moving towards the goal at (0, 4).

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (1, 3):
- Position (0, 3) is an empty space
- Position (2, 2) is an empty space

Since the goal is at (0, 4), I should move to (0, 3) because:
1. It's an empty space
2. It gets me closer to the goal at (0, 4)
3. From there, I'll be just one step away from the goal

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinates (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (0, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0, 3), I need to reach the goal at (0, 4).

Looking at the coordinates, I can see that the goal position (0, 4) is directly to the right of my current position. However, checking the lists of coordinates, I notice that (0, 4) is neither in the walls list nor in the empty spaces list. Since it's the goal position, it should be accessible.

Therefore, I choose to move to the goal coordinates (0, 4).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "7" shape. The vertical line of the "7" runs from (4,0) to (4,4), and the horizontal line runs from (0,3) to (4,3), with a few additional connecting spaces.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (7x7) where the empty spaces form a "7" shape, but with a slightly different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3)

Player position: (5, 3)
Goal: (0, 3)

In this new maze:
- The horizontal line of the "7" runs along row 3-4
- The vertical line runs down column 3
- The path from P to G is straightforward along the "7" shape
- The overall dimensions remain 7x7
- The shape is still clearly recognizable as a "7"
- The maze is different from the original but maintains the same general pattern
