You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 2)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the current player position (1, 2), I need to reach the goal at (4, 3). Looking at the available empty spaces and considering that I can move in any direction (including diagonals), I'll analyze my options:

Current position: (1, 2)
Adjacent empty spaces I can move to:
- (1, 1) - moving left
- (1, 3) - moving right

Since the goal is at (4, 3), which is to the right and down from my current position, moving right towards (1, 3) would be the most logical choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to: (1, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 3)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 3), I need to continue making progress towards the goal at (4, 3).

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position:
- (1, 2) - moving left (but this would be going backwards)
- (1, 4) - moving right
- No direct downward movement possible due to wall at (2, 3)

Since I need to get to (4, 3) which is still down and to the right, and I can't move directly down due to walls, I should continue moving right through the available path.

I choose to move to: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1, 4), analyzing the situation:

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position:
- (1, 3) - moving left (backwards)
- (1, 5) - moving right
- (2, 5) - moving diagonally down-right

Since I need to get to (4, 3) which is down and slightly to the left from my current position, and I can't move directly down due to the wall at (2, 4), I should take advantage of the diagonal path that will help me progress downward.

I choose to move to: (2, 5)

This will help me start making progress downward while avoiding the walls.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (3, 4), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 5), analyzing the situation:

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position:
- (1, 5) - moving up (backwards)
- (3, 4) - moving diagonally down-left

The goal is at (4, 3), which is down and to the left from my current position. The only viable forward movement that brings me closer to the goal is the diagonal move to (3, 4).

I choose to move to: (3, 4)

This move will help me get closer to the goal position by moving both downward and leftward, which is exactly the direction we need to go.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0)
Empty: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Player position: (3, 4)
Goal: (4, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 4), analyzing the situation:

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position:
- (2, 5) - moving diagonally up-right (backwards)
- No direct path to the left due to wall at (3, 3)
- No direct path down due to wall at (4, 4)
- (5, 2) - moving diagonally down-left

The goal is at (4, 3), which is down and to the left from my current position. While we can't move directly to it due to walls, we can move diagonally down-left to (5, 2), which will help us get closer to our goal.

I choose to move to: (5, 2)

This diagonal move will help us progress towards the goal by getting us closer to a position from which we can reach (4, 3).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "Z" shape - starting from the top, moving horizontally right, then diagonally down-left, and finally horizontally right again at the bottom.

Here's my new maze design that maintains this "Z" pattern but with slightly different positioning:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)

Empty: (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)

Player position: (1, 1)
Goal: (6, 3)

This new maze:
1. Maintains the same 7x7 grid size
2. Forms a clear "Z" pattern with its corridors
3. Has a valid path from P to G
4. Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
5. The "Z" is formed by a top horizontal corridor, diagonal middle section, and bottom horizontal corridor
