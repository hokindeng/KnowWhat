You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position: either up, down, left, right, or any diagonal. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 3)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and determine the best next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
1. The player (P) is at (2, 3)
2. The goal (G) is at (3, 5)
3. I need to navigate through the empty spaces to reach the goal

Looking at the empty spaces around the current position (2, 3), I can move to:
- (2, 4) which is directly to the right

This seems like the logical first step as it moves me closer to the goal position while staying on a valid path.

I choose to move to coordinate (2, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 4), I can see that:
1. I need to continue moving towards the goal at (3, 5)
2. Looking at the available empty spaces, I can move to:
   - (2, 5) which is directly to the right

Moving to (2, 5) will keep me on a valid path and bring me closer to the goal position.

I choose to move to coordinate (2, 5).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 5)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 5), I can see that:
1. The goal is at (3, 5), which is directly below my current position
2. Looking at the available empty spaces around me, I can move to:
   - (2, 6) to the right
   - (2, 4) to the left

Since the goal is at (3, 5) but there's a wall directly below me, I need to find a path around. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see there's a path that goes through (4, 4) and (5, 4) that can eventually lead to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (2, 6) as this will help me start moving towards that alternative path to reach the goal.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)
Empty: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)
Player position: (2, 6)
Goal: (3, 5)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 6), I can see that:
1. The goal is at (3, 5)
2. Looking at the available empty spaces, I can move to:
   - (2, 5) to the left
   - (4, 4) diagonally down and to the left

Since moving back to (2, 5) wouldn't help me progress towards the goal, I should take the diagonal path to (4, 4). This will help me access the lower path that can lead to the goal.

I choose to move to coordinate (4, 4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (4, 4), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), I can see that they form:

1. The general shape is a "7" (seven). The top horizontal line of the seven is formed by the spaces from (2,3) to (2,6), and the vertical line is formed by the spaces from (4,4) down to (5,6), with a slight angle.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a "7" shape:

Walls: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,6), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,6), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)
Empty: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)
Player position: (1,3)
Goal: (5,5)

In this new maze, I've shifted the horizontal line of the "7" up one row and adjusted the vertical line slightly, but maintained the same general "7" shape. The path is still navigable from P to G through the empty spaces.
