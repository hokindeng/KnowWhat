You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
- I'm currently at position (4, 1)
- The goal is at (3, 4)
- I need to navigate through empty spaces while avoiding walls

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 1):
- Up: (3, 1) is a wall
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: (4, 0) is empty
- Right: (4, 2) is empty

Since I need to eventually reach (3, 4), and I'm currently at the bottom of the maze, I should try to move towards the right side first, as that's the direction of the goal. Moving right to (4, 2) will give me more options for subsequent moves.

Therefore, I choose to move to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position (4, 2).

Adjacent spaces:
- Up: (3, 2) is a wall
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: (4, 1) is empty
- Right: (4, 3) is empty

Since my goal is at (3, 4), and I need to continue moving towards the right side of the maze, the logical choice is to move right to (4, 3).

Therefore, I choose to move to: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the possible moves from my current position (4, 3).

Adjacent spaces:
- Up: (3, 3) is a wall
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: (4, 2) is empty
- Right: (4, 4) is empty

Since my goal is at (3, 4), and I need to get closer to it, moving to (4, 4) will put me directly below the path that can lead to the goal. From there, I can plan my next moves to reach (3, 4).

Therefore, I choose to move to: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position (4, 4), I can now move up to reach the goal position.

Adjacent spaces:
- Up: (3, 4) is empty (and it's the goal!)
- Down: not possible (outside maze)
- Left: (4, 3) is empty
- Right: not possible (outside maze)

Since (3, 4) is the goal position and it's directly above me, this is the obvious choice.

Therefore, I choose to move to: (3, 4)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts from the top, goes down one side, curves at the bottom, and goes back up the other side.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with a "U" shaped corridor pattern:

Walls: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (0, 4)

This maze:
- Maintains a 5x5 grid size
- Has a clear U-shaped corridor
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape concept
- Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- The U-shape is formed by having a corridor down the left side, across the bottom, and up the right side

The main differences from the original are:
- Different start and goal positions
- Slightly different wall placements
- Wider bottom corridor
But the essential U-shape of the traversable path is preserved.
