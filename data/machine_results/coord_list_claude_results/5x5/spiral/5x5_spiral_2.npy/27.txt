You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize that:
- I'm currently at position (4, 1)
- The goal is at (3, 4)
- I need to navigate through empty spaces while avoiding walls

Looking at the empty spaces adjacent to my current position (4, 1), I can move to:
- (4, 0) - moving left
- (4, 2) - moving right

Since the goal is at (3, 4), which is in the upper-right part of the maze, I should try to move towards that direction. Moving right to (4, 2) would be a better choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), I can see that:
- I need to reach (3, 4)
- I can move to:
  - (4, 1) - moving left
  - (4, 3) - moving right

Since the goal is at (3, 4), which is to the upper-right, moving right to (4, 3) would bring me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), I can see that:
- I need to reach (3, 4)
- I can move to:
  - (4, 2) - moving left
  - (4, 4) - moving right

Since the goal is at (3, 4), which is to the upper-right, moving right to (4, 4) would bring me closer to the goal.

I choose to move to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 4), I can see that:
- I need to reach (3, 4)
- I can move to:
  - (4, 3) - moving left
  - (3, 4) - moving up

The goal position (3, 4) is directly above me and it's an available move.

I choose to move to (3, 4), which will complete the maze!

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts from the top-left corner, goes down the left side, across the bottom, and then up the right side.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze that maintains a "U" shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (0, 4)

In this new maze:
- The U-shape is more symmetrical
- The path still allows movement from P to G
- The walls create a clear U-shaped corridor
- The maze maintains the same 5x5 dimensions
- The layout is distinctly different from the original while preserving the U-shape pattern
