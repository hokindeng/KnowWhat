You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

Based on the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:

P represents Player, G represents Goal, # represents Walls, and . represents Empty spaces.

```
. . . . P
# # # # .
. . . # .
# . # # .
. . . . .
```

To reach the goal position at (2, 1), I need to navigate through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

From the current position (0, 4), I can only move down to (1, 4) as it's the only valid adjacent empty space.

Therefore, my next move is to: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state.

The maze now looks like:

```
. . . . .
# # # # P
. . . # .
# . # # .
. . . . .
```

From my current position at (1, 4), I can move:
- Up to (0, 4) - but this would be moving backwards
- Down to (2, 4) - this moves me closer to the goal

Moving to (2, 4) will allow me to continue navigating towards the goal at (2, 1).

Therefore, my next move is to: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state.

The maze now looks like:

```
. . . . .
# # # # .
. . . # P
# . # # .
. . . . .
```

From my current position at (2, 4), I can move:
- Up to (1, 4) - but this would be moving backwards
- Down to (3, 4)
- Left to (2, 2) - this moves me closer to the goal

Moving to (2, 2) will allow me to continue making progress towards the goal at (2, 1).

Therefore, my next move is to: (2, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "U" shape, with one arm of the U having an additional branch.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size (5x5) that maintains a U-shaped path but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 4)

This would look like:
```
P . # . .
. . # . .
. . # . .
. . # . .
. # . . G
```

In this maze, the empty spaces form a clear U-shape, with the player needing to go down one side of the U, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal. The path is still valid and traversable, but the arrangement of walls and empty spaces is different from the original while maintaining the same general U-shaped pattern.
