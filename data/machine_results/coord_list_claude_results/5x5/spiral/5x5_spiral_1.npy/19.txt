You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

Based on the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:

P represents Player, G represents Goal, # represents Walls, and . represents Empty spaces.

```
. . . . P
# # # # .
. . . # .
# . # # .
. . . . .
```

To reach the goal position (2, 1), I need to navigate through empty spaces while avoiding walls.

From the current position (0, 4), I can only move left to (0, 3) as my first step, as this is the only valid adjacent empty space.

Therefore, my next move is to position (0, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state.

The maze now looks like:

```
. . . P .
# # # # .
. . . # .
# . # # .
. . . . .
```

From my current position (0, 3), I can move:
- Left to (0, 2)
- Right to (0, 4)

To reach the goal at (2, 1), I need to continue moving towards the left side of the maze to eventually reach the bottom path.

Therefore, I choose to move left to position (0, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state.

The maze now looks like:

```
. . P . .

From my current position (0, 2), I can move:
- Left to (0, 1)
- Right to (0, 3)

To reach the goal at (2, 1), I need to continue moving towards the left side of the maze to eventually reach the bottom path.

Therefore, I choose to move left to position (0, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state.

The maze now looks like:

```
. P . . .
# # # # .
. . . # .

. . . . .
```

From my current position (0, 1), I can move:
- Left to (0, 0)
- Right to (0, 2)

To reach the goal at (2, 1), I need to move to the left to access the path that will lead me down to the goal position.

Therefore, I choose to move left to position (0, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state.

The maze now looks like:

```
P . . . .
# # # # .
. . . # .
# . # # .
. . . . .
```

From my current position (0, 0), I can move:
- Right to (0, 1)
- Down to (2, 0) [since (1,0) is a wall, but (2,0) is empty]

To reach the goal at (2, 1), I need to move down to access the lower part of the maze where the goal is located.

Therefore, I choose to move down to position (2, 0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "U" shape. The path starts from the top row, goes down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming a "U" shape:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

This maze would look like:
```
. # # # P
. # # # .
. # # # .
. # # # .
. . . . .
```

The empty spaces form a U-shape with:
- A vertical corridor on the left
- A vertical corridor on the right
- A horizontal corridor at the bottom
- The player needs to go down the right side, across the bottom, and up the left side to reach the goal

This maze maintains the U-shape pattern while being distinct from the original maze, and provides a valid path from P to G.
