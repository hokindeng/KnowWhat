You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

Based on the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:

P represents Player
G represents Goal
# represents Wall
. represents Empty space

```
. . . . P
# # # # .
. . . # .
# . # # .
. . . . .
```

Starting from position (0, 4), I need to reach (2, 1).

Looking at the available moves:
- I can't move up (out of bounds)
- I can't move right (out of bounds)
- I can't move left (already at the leftmost position)
- I can move down to (1, 4)

The best path would be to move down first, so I choose to move to coordinate (1, 4).

My next move is: (1, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:

```
. . . . .
# # # # P
. . . # .
# . # # .
. . . . .
```

From my current position (1, 4), I can:
- Move up to (0, 4) - but this would be moving backwards
- Can't move right (out of bounds)
- Move down to (2, 4)
- Can't move left (wall at 1, 3)

The goal is at (2, 1), so I need to move down and then work my way left. Moving down to (2, 4) is the best option as it brings me closer to the goal while maintaining a path to reach it.

My next move is: (2, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 4)
Goal: (2, 1)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current state:

```
. . . . .
# # # # .
. . . # P
# . # # .
. . . . .
```

From my current position (2, 4), I can:
- Move up to (1, 4) - but this would be moving backwards
- Can't move right (out of bounds)
- Move down to (3, 4)
- Move left to (2, 2)

The goal is at (2, 1), and I need to move left to reach it. I can move to (2, 2), which will get me closer to the goal position.

My next move is: (2, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a rough "U" shape. The path starts from the top row, goes down the right side, and connects through the bottom row to go back up towards the goal position in the middle-left area.

2) Here's a new maze with a similar "U" shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (1, 1), (2, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

This creates a maze where:
- The path forms a U shape
- The player starts at the top-right
- The goal is reachable by following the U-shaped corridor
- The walls create a different pattern but maintain the U-shaped negative space
- The maze is the same 5x5 size as the original

The path would go down the right side, across the bottom, and up the left side to reach the goal, maintaining the U-shaped corridor pattern of the original maze but with a different specific arrangement.
