You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```
where # represents walls, _ represents empty spaces, P is the player position, and G is the goal.

Starting from position (4, 2), I need to reach (3, 0).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to go towards the left side of the maze. The best path would be to move left first.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the available moves.

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to continue moving towards the left side of the maze and then find a way up. Moving left to (4, 0) is the best option as it brings me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 0), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and down are not possible (edge of maze)

Looking at the goal at (3, 0), I need to find a path that goes up. Since I can't go directly up from here, I'll need to find an alternate route. The best path would be to go up through the right side of the maze.

I should move right to (4, 1) and then work my way around to reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I realize I need to change my strategy. Going back and forth between (4, 0) and (4, 1) won't help me reach the goal. Since I can't go up directly from this side due to the walls, I need to try going around through the right side of the maze.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

I need to continue moving right to try to find a path up through the right side of the maze.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

From my current position at (4, 3), I can move:

- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

Since I still can't go up from here due to the wall at (3, 3), I'll continue moving right to try to find a path up.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (4, 4), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 4)
- Left is possible to (4, 3)
- Right and down are not possible (edge of maze)

I now realize I've reached a dead end on the right side of the maze. The walls at row 3 completely block any upward movement from the bottom row. I need to backtrack and try a different approach.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 3), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

After exploring the right side and finding no way up, I need to continue backtracking to the left and try to find another solution. Looking at the maze structure again, I realize we need to find a way to get to the top row and then move left to reach the goal, since the third row is completely blocked by walls.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 2), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

Looking at the maze structure more carefully now:
1. Row 3 is completely blocked by walls
2. We need to somehow get to row 2 or above
3. There must be a path through row 2 that we haven't properly explored yet
4. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that (2, 2) is actually accessible

Let's continue moving left to try to find a path that will let us get to the upper rows.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:

- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

Looking at the maze again:
1. We need to get to the upper rows
2. The only way to get there must be through the left side
3. I notice that (2, 0) is an empty space
4. We might be able to reach it through (1, 0)

Let's try moving to the leftmost column to see if we can find a path up.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 0), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and down are not possible (edge of maze)

Now I can see that I've explored all possible paths and understand the maze better:
1. The bottom row doesn't provide access to upper rows
2. Row 3 is completely blocked with walls
3. Looking at the empty spaces again, I notice that (2, 0) and (1, 0) are empty
4. The leftmost column (x=0) is completely empty!

We need to get to the leftmost column, but we can't do it from the bottom. We need to try going through (2, 2) to reach the top rows.

Let's move back right to start that path.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I now have a clear strategy:
1. We need to get to (2, 2) which is an empty space
2. From there we can move to the top row
3. Then we can use the top row to reach the leftmost column
4. Finally move down to the goal

To execute this plan, let's first move right to start the path toward (2, 2).

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

1. We need to get to (2, 2) which is an empty space
2. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that (2, 2) connects to (2, 3) and (2, 4)

I realize now that I made a mistake in my previous moves. Even though (2, 4) is empty, there's no way to reach it from the bottom row because (3, 4) is a wall. We can't get up to row 2 from this side.

Let's backtrack and try a different approach.

After exploring both sides of the maze, I now understand:
1. We can't get up from the bottom row anywhere - it's completely blocked by walls in row 3
2. The only way to reach the goal must involve getting to the top rows through (2, 2)
3. We need to find a way to reach (2, 2) from a different direction
4. Looking at the empty spaces again, I notice that (0, 0) through (0, 4) are all empty

Let's continue backtracking to try to find another approach.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

1. The empty spaces form a "U" shape. The path requires going up one side of the U, across the top, and down the other side to reach the goal.

2. Here's a new 5x5 maze with a U-shaped path:

Walls: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (4, 4)

This creates a U-shape where:
- The left vertical line is at x=0
- The right vertical line is at x=4
- The horizontal connecting line is at y=0
- The walls create a solid block in the middle
- The player must go up the left side, across the top, and down the right side to reach the goal

This maze maintains the U-shape pattern while being distinct from the original maze.
