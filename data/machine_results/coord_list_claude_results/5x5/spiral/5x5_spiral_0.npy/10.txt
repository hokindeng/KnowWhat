You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```
where # represents walls, _ represents empty spaces, P is the player position, and G is the goal.

Starting from position (4, 2), I need to reach (3, 0).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to go towards the left side of the maze. The best path would be to move left first.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the available moves.

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to continue moving towards the left side of the maze and then find a way up. Moving left to (4, 0) is the best option as it brings me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 0), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and down are not possible (edge of maze)

Looking at the goal at (3, 0), I need to find a path that goes up. Since I can't go directly up from here, I'll need to find an alternate route. The best path would be to go up through the right side of the maze.

I should move right to (4, 1) and then work my way around to reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I realize I need to change my strategy. Going back and forth between (4, 0) and (4, 1) won't help me reach the goal. Since I can't go up directly from this side due to the walls, I need to try going around through the right side of the maze.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 3), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)

Since I still can't go up from here due to the wall, I'll continue moving right to try to find a path up.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 4)

From my current position at (4, 4), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 4)
- Left is possible to (4, 3)
- Right and down are not possible (edge of maze)

I've reached the right edge of the maze, and I still can't go up due to walls. Since going right didn't help find a path up, I need to backtrack and try a different approach. The goal is at (3, 0), and there must be a path through the upper part of the maze.

Let's move back left.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 3), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

Looking at the maze more carefully now, I realize I need to completely rethink my strategy. The goal at (3, 0) must be reachable through the top of the maze, and I need to find a way up there. Looking at the empty spaces, there appears to be a path through (2, 2) and (2, 3).

Let's continue moving left to try to find a way up through the middle section.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (4, 2), I can move:

- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

I see that I need to get to the empty spaces at (2, 2) and above, but I can't go up directly from here due to the walls. Let's continue moving left to try to find a path up through the left side of the maze.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I've been moving back and forth without making real progress. Looking at the maze structure again:
1. The goal is at (3, 0)
2. There must be a path through the top portion of the maze
3. I need to find a way to get up there

Let's try moving to (4, 0) and see if we can find a path up through the leftmost column.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

From my current position at (4, 0), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and down are not possible (edge of maze)

Looking at the maze more carefully now:
1. I notice that (2, 0) is an empty space
2. To get there, I need to first get to the top of the maze through (0, 0)
3. Then I can work my way down to (2, 0) and reach (3, 0)

Since I can't go up directly from here, I need to find the path that leads to (0, 0). Let's move right and then try to find a path up through the middle section where there are empty spaces.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:

Looking at the entire maze structure more carefully:
1. I notice that (2, 2) is an empty space
2. From (2, 2) I can reach the top row
3. From the top row, I can move to (2, 0) and then to the goal
4. To reach (2, 2), I need to move right and find a path up

Instead of continuing to move back and forth in the bottom row, I should move right to try to reach (2, 2).

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at the empty spaces in the maze:
1. (2, 2) is empty and connects to the top row
2. (2, 3) and (2, 4) are also empty
3. I need to get to one of these spaces to reach the top

Since I can't go up directly from (4, 2), I should continue moving right to try to reach (2, 3) or (2, 4) where there might be a path up.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

From my current position at (4, 3), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

I've been moving around the bottom row without making progress. Let's think about this differently:
1. Looking at the empty spaces, I see (2, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 4) form a path
2. These connect to (1, 4) which is empty
3. From there I can reach the top row
4. But I still need to find a way up from the bottom row

Since I can't go up from any position in the bottom row, I must be missing something. Let me check the coordinates again...

I notice that (2, 2) is empty and connects to the top row. I need to find a way to get there. Moving right and left in the bottom row isn't helping. Let me try moving back left to explore other possibilities.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (4, 2), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

After moving back and forth several times, I need to completely rethink my approach. Let me list out what I know:
1. The goal is at (3, 0)
2. There's a path through (2, 0) to reach it
3. To get to (2, 0), I need to go through the top row
4. To reach the top row, I need to find a way up
5. Looking at the walls and empty spaces again, I notice that (2, 2) is empty and connects to the top
6. But I can't reach (2, 2) from the bottom row because of the walls at row 3

This means I must have missed something important. The solution must involve going through (0, 0) first, then working my way down to the goal.

Let's try moving left towards (4, 0) again.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:

- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

After all this movement, I realize I need to look at this puzzle differently. Let me trace the ONLY possible path to the goal:
1. The goal is at (3, 0)
2. To reach (3, 0), I must come from (2, 0)
3. To reach (2, 0), I must come from the top row
4. To reach the top row, I must go through (0, 0)
5. Looking at the empty spaces list again, I see (0, 0) is empty
6. I need to get to (0, 0) first!

Let's continue moving left to (4, 0), and then we must find a way to get to (0, 0).

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

(1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape. The path requires going up the left side, across the top row, and then down to reach the goal - forming a U-shaped corridor.

(2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with a U-shaped path:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (2, 4)

This creates a U-shaped corridor where the player must go up the left side, across the top, and down the right side to reach the goal. The visualization would look like:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # # # _
_ # # # _
P # # # G
```

This maze maintains the U-shape pattern but is distinct from the original maze while still providing a valid solution path.
