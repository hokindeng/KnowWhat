You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```
where # represents walls, _ represents empty spaces, P is the player position, and G is the goal.

Starting from position (4, 2), I need to reach (3, 0).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to go towards the left side of the maze. The best path would be to move left first.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the available moves.

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to continue moving towards the left side of the maze and then find a way up. Moving left to (4, 0) is the best option as it brings me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 0), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and down are not possible (edge of maze)

Looking at the goal at (3, 0), I need to find a path that goes up. Since I can't go directly up from here, I'll need to find an alternate route. The best path would be to go up through the right side of the maze.

I should move right to (4, 1) and then work my way around to reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I realize I need to change my strategy. Going back and forth between (4, 0) and (4, 1) won't help me reach the goal. Since I can't go up directly from this side due to the walls, I need to try going around through the right side of the maze.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 3), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

Since I still can't go up from here due to the wall, I'll continue moving right to try to find a path up.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 4)

From my current position at (4, 4), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 4)
- Left is possible to (4, 3)
- Right and down are not possible (edge of maze)

I've reached the right edge of the maze, and I still can't go up due to walls. Since going right didn't help find a path up, I need to backtrack and try a different approach. The only open path to the goal must be through the top of the maze.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 3), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

I now understand that I need to completely rethink my strategy. The only way to reach the goal at (3, 0) must be by going up through the empty spaces at the top of the maze, since all direct paths are blocked by walls. I need to backtrack towards the left side and then find a path up through the top.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (4, 2), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

I need to continue moving left to eventually find a path up through the top of the maze. The goal at (3, 0) can only be reached by going up through the leftmost or rightmost columns and then across the top row, since the middle is blocked by walls.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I need to continue moving left to reach (4, 0), and then I should be able to find a path up through the leftmost column to reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

From my current position at (4, 0), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and down are not possible (edge of maze)

Now I can see that I need to try a different approach. Since I can't go up through the leftmost column due to the wall at (3, 0), and I've already tried the rightmost path, I need to try going up through the middle section of the maze. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that there might be a path through (2, 2) or (2, 3).

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Looking at the maze more carefully now, I can see that:
1. I need to reach (2, 0) to get to the goal
2. There's an empty path at (2, 2)
3. I should try to go up through the middle section and then move left along row 2

From my current position at (4, 2), I can move:

- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

Looking at the maze structure:
1. I can see that (2, 2) is an empty space
2. To reach it, I need to first get to a position where I can move up
3. The walls at row 3 block direct upward movement
4. I should try to reach (2, 2) from the right side

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

Looking at the maze structure again:
1. I need to get to (2, 2) or (2, 3)
2. All positions in row 3 are walls
3. I need to find a way up through row 2
4. There's an empty space at (1, 4)

I should try to get to (1, 4) by going through (4, 4) first, then I might be able to move left through row 2.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 4)

- Right and down are not possible (edge of maze)

Now I can see that even though there's an empty space at (1, 4), I can't reach it directly because of the wall at (3, 4). I need to revise my strategy:
1. I can't go up through any position in row 3 (all walls)
2. I need to find a way to reach (2, 2) or (2, 3)
3. Moving along the bottom row isn't helping

Let's backtrack and try a different approach.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

After exploring all possibilities, I realize:
1. I can't go up anywhere in row 3 (all walls)
2. I can't reach (1, 4) from the right side
3. I need to try reaching (2, 2) from below
4. The only way to get to the goal must be through (2, 2) and then (2, 0)

Let's move back towards (4, 2) to try to find a path up through (2, 2).

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, I can see that they form a "U" shape. The empty spaces create a path that goes down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side, with some additional branches.

Here's my new maze design with a similar U-shaped corridor pattern:

Walls: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 0)

This new maze:
1. Is 5x5 like the original
2. Has a U-shaped main corridor
3. Provides a valid path from P to G
4. Is different from the original but maintains the U-shape pattern
5. The U-shape is formed by empty spaces going down the right side, across the bottom, and up the left side

The main difference is that this maze has its walls concentrated in the middle column and upper-middle area, rather than scattered throughout, but it maintains the essential U-shaped corridor pattern.
