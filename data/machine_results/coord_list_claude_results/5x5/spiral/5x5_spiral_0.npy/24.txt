You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```
where # represents walls, _ represents empty spaces, P is the player position, and G is the goal.

Starting from position (4, 2), I need to reach (3, 0).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to go around the walls, and the best path would be to move left first.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ P _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

Since my goal is to reach (3, 0), and I need to find a path around the walls, moving left to (4, 0) is the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
P _ _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and Down are not possible (edge of maze)

Since I can't directly reach the goal from here, I need to find an alternate path. The only way to reach (3, 0) is to go around through the top of the maze.

I should move right and then up through the leftmost column. Therefore, my next move is to (4, 1).

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ P _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

Since I just came from (4, 0) and that path didn't work, I need to try a different route. The best alternative would be to go right and then try to reach the goal through the right side of the maze.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), let me analyze the available moves:

```
_ _ _ _ _

```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

Since I just came from (4, 1) and going back that way didn't work, I should continue exploring the right side of the maze. Moving right will allow me to potentially go up and around through the right side of the maze to reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

Since I just came from (4, 2) and that path didn't work, I should continue moving right to explore the rightmost path up. This might allow me to go up and around through the right side of the maze to reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 4), let me analyze the available moves:

```
_ _ _ _ _

_ _ _ _ P
```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 4)
- Left is possible to (4, 3)
- Right is not possible (edge of maze)

I've now explored the entire bottom row and found that I can't go up from any position due to the walls. I need to backtrack and try a completely different approach. The goal at (3, 0) must be reachable from the top of the maze, so I need to find a path that goes up through one of the columns.

Let's go back left and try to find a different route.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), let me analyze the situation:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ _ P _
```

I've now explored:
- The right side which is blocked by walls
- The bottom row which has no way up
- Going back towards the left side which didn't work

Looking at the maze structure more carefully, I notice that the only way to reach (3, 0) must be from above, since it's surrounded by walls on other sides. This means I need to get to the top row of the maze first.

The only way to get up must be through the leftmost column (0), since all other vertical paths are blocked by walls. So I need to go back to (4, 0) and then work my way up from there.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 2), continuing my way back left.

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), let me continue with my plan:

```
_ _ _ _ _

# # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```

I need to continue moving left to reach (4, 0), from where I can access the leftmost column that will allow me to reach the top row and eventually the goal at (3, 0).

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), continuing with my plan:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ P _ _ _
```

I need to move to (4, 0) to access the leftmost column, which is the only path that will allow me to reach the top row and eventually get to the goal at (3, 0).

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 0), let me analyze:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
P _ _ _ _
```

Now that I'm at (4, 0), I can see that I can move up through the leftmost column. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see that (2, 0) and (1, 0) are available, which will allow me to reach the top row.

Therefore, my next move is to (2, 0), moving up two spaces since (3, 0) is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape, with two vertical corridors on the left and right sides connected by a horizontal corridor at the bottom.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with a U-shaped path:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 0)

This creates a U-shaped path where:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # # # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

The path is still U-shaped but with a longer vertical section on both sides and the same horizontal connection at the bottom. The player can move from bottom-right to top-left through the U-shaped corridor.
