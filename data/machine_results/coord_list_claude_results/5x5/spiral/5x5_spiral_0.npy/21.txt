You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```
where # represents walls, _ represents empty spaces, P is the player position, and G is the goal.

Starting from position (4, 2), I need to reach (3, 0).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to go around the walls, and the best path would be to move left first.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

The maze looks like this:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ P _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

Since my goal is to reach (3, 0), and I need to find a path around the walls, moving left to (4, 0) will bring me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

The maze looks like this:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _

P _ _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and Down are not possible (edge of maze)

Since I'm at (4, 0) and need to reach (3, 0), I need to find a path around. The only way to reach the goal is to go up through the left side of the maze. Since I can't go up directly from my current position due to a wall, I need to go around through the top of the maze.

I should move right first to begin the path around the walls.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

Since I just came from (4, 0) and I need to find a path around to reach (3, 0), I should continue moving right to eventually go up through the right side of the maze and then back left at the top.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 4)
- Left is possible to (4, 3)
- Right is not possible (edge of maze)

Since I'm at the rightmost edge and can't go up due to a wall, I need to move to an empty space where I can go up. Looking at the maze, I can see that (2, 4) is empty, and I can reach it by going through (4, 3).

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

Since I just came from (4, 4) and I need to find a path to (3, 0), I should move left and work my way up through one of the open passages. Moving left will help me get closer to my goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

I've been going back and forth in the bottom row without making progress. Looking at the maze structure again, I notice that (2, 2) is an empty space. If I can get to it, I can work my way to the goal. To reach (2, 2), I need to go up through one of the gaps, which means I should move left towards the open passage.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Looking at the available moves:

- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I need to get to (3, 0), and I can see that I need to go through the left side of the maze and up through (2, 0) to reach it. Since I'm already on the left side, I should continue moving left.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and Down are not possible (edge of maze)

I seem to be stuck in a loop. Let me think about this more carefully...

To reach (3, 0), I need to go up through (2, 0) and then (1, 0). Since I can't go up directly from my current position, I need to find another way. The only path to get there is to:
1. Go to the right side of the maze
2. Go up through the open passage
3. Move left along the top of the maze
4. Come down to (3, 0)

So, I should start by moving right.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

```

Looking at my previous moves, I realize I've been going back and forth without making progress. Let me plan the complete path:
1. I need to get to the right side where there's an opening
2. Go up through (2, 2) or (2, 3)
3. Then move left along the top to reach (3, 0)

Following this plan, I should continue moving right to reach the opening.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

2. Go up through (2, 2) or (2, 3)
3. Then move left along the top to reach (3, 0)

I notice that I'm actually at (4, 2) and there's an empty space at (2, 2) directly above me, but I can't reach it because of the wall at (3, 2). I need to continue moving right to reach the opening.

I'm at (4, 3) now, and I can see that (2, 3) is empty, but I can't reach it directly because of the wall at (3, 3). I need to continue to the rightmost position where I might find a way up.

Looking at my position and the maze structure:
1. I'm at the rightmost position (4, 4)
2. I can see that (2, 4) is empty, but I can't reach it directly because of the wall at (3, 4)
3. I need to move back to (4, 3) to try to find a way up through (2, 3)

Since I've explored the rightmost position and found no way up, I should move back left.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

The maze looks like this:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ _ P _
```

I've been going back and forth in the bottom row, but I need to rethink my strategy. Looking at the maze structure:
1. I can see that (2, 2) and (2, 3) are empty spaces
2. All positions in row 3 are walls
3. I need to find a way to get up to row 2

Looking at the empty spaces in row 2 (2, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 4), I should try to move to (4, 2) and see if there's a different approach I haven't tried yet.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ _ P _
```

1. The empty spaces form a "U" shape, where there's a path that goes down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side.

2. Here's a new maze with the same U-shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

This creates a U-shaped corridor where:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # # # _
_ # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```
The player must go down one side of the U, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal, maintaining the same general shape principle as the original maze but with a different specific layout.
