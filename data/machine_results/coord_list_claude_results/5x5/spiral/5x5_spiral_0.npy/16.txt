You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```
where # represents walls, _ represents empty spaces, P is the player position, and G is the goal.

Starting from position (4, 2), I need to reach (3, 0).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to go towards the left side of the maze. The best path would be to move left first.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the available moves.

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to continue moving towards the left side of the maze and then find a way up. Moving left to (4, 0) is the best option as it brings me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 0), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and down are not possible (edge of maze)

Looking at the goal at (3, 0), I need to find a path that goes up. Since I can't go directly up from here, I'll need to find an alternate route. The best path would be to go up through the right side of the maze.

I should move right to (4, 1) and then work my way around to reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I realize I need to try a different approach since going left and right between (4, 0) and (4, 1) won't help me reach the goal. I need to go to the right side of the maze and find a path up through there.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (4, 2), I can move:

- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

I need to continue moving right to find a path up through the right side of the maze, as this seems to be the only way to eventually reach the goal at (3, 0).

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

From my current position at (4, 3), I can move:

- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

Since I need to find a way up to eventually reach the goal at (3, 0), and I can't go up from my current position, I should continue moving right to (4, 4) and then try to find a path up from there.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 4)

From my current position at (4, 4), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 4)
- Left is possible to (4, 3)
- Right and down are not possible (edge of maze)

I can now see that I've reached a dead end on the right side of the maze. The wall at (3, 4) prevents me from going up. I need to backtrack and try a different approach.

Let's move back left.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

From my current position at (4, 3), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

I've already tried going right and found it's a dead end. Looking at the maze again, I notice that I need to find a path that will let me get up to the top portion of the maze, as that's the only way to reach the goal at (3, 0). 

Let's continue backtracking to the left to try to find another path.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

From my current position at (4, 2), I can move:

- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

Looking at the maze more carefully now, I notice that there appears to be a path through (2, 2) and (2, 3) in the middle of the maze. To reach that path, I need to get to (2, 2), which means I should try to find a way up through the middle section.

Let's continue moving left to explore that possibility.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I've been going back and forth in the bottom row, but I need to find a way up. Looking at the maze structure again:
1. The goal is at (3, 0)
2. There's a path through (2, 2) and (2, 3)
3. There must be a way to get up to (2, 0) from the left side

Let's try moving left to (4, 0) to explore the left side path.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

Looking at the maze again, I notice that:
1. I can't go directly up to the goal from here
2. I need to find a way to get to (2, 0), which would allow me to reach the goal
3. To get to (2, 0), I need to go through the top part of the maze
4. The only way to get to the top part is through the gap at (2, 2)

I need to go back right and try to reach (2, 2) through the right side of the maze.

After exploring all possible paths, I can now see the complete solution:
1. I need to get to (2, 2), which is the only opening in the middle
2. From there, I can move to (2, 0)

I've reached the right edge, but I can't go up here because of the wall at (3, 4). Looking at the maze again, I notice that I can't actually get to (2, 4) from this position because of the wall at (3, 4). I need to revise my strategy.

Let's backtrack to try a different approach.

I've been going back and forth in the bottom row, but I need to completely rethink my strategy. Looking at the maze again:
1. The goal is at (3, 0)
2. There's a path at (2, 2) and (2, 3)
3. I need to get to (2, 0) to reach the goal
4. The only way to get there must be through the top row

Let's try going back to the left side and see if we can find a path up through the top row.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, I can see that they form a "U" shape. The path requires going down one side of the U, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal.

Here's my proposed new maze with the same U-shape pattern:

Walls: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 0)

This maze:
1. Is 5x5 like the original
2. Has a U-shaped corridor pattern
3. Has a valid path from P to G
4. Is different from the original but maintains the same general shape
5. Forces the player to traverse the U shape to reach the goal

The main difference is that this maze has its walls more centered and the U-shape is more symmetrical than in the original maze.
