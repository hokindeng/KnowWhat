You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```
where # represents walls, _ represents empty spaces, P is the player position, and G is the goal.

Starting from position (4, 2), I need to reach (3, 0).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to go around the walls, and the best path would be to move left first.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

The maze looks like this:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ P _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves from (4, 1):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

Since my goal is to reach (3, 0), and I need to find a path around the walls, moving left to (4, 0) will get me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

The maze looks like this:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
P _ _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves from (4, 0):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and Down are not possible (edge of maze)

Since I can't directly reach the goal at (3, 0) from here, I need to find an alternate path. The only way to reach the goal will be to go up through the left side of the maze, which means I need to first move right and then find a path up through the empty spaces.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

The maze looks like this:
```
_ _ _ _ _

```

Looking at the available moves from (4, 1):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I've already tried going left to (4, 0), which didn't lead to a solution. I need to try a different approach. Moving right will allow me to potentially find a path up through the right side of the maze, which might give me access to the top portion where I can reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Looking at the available moves from (4, 2):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

I've already tried going left, and that path didn't work. Moving right will allow me to try to find a path up through the right side of the maze, which might give me access to the top portion where I can reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at the available moves from (4, 3):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

I've already tried going left and that path didn't work. Let's continue moving right to try to find a path up through the rightmost side of the maze.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Player position: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 4), let me analyze the available moves:

The maze looks like this:
```
_ _ _ _ _

```

Looking at the available moves from (4, 4):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 4)
- Left is possible to (4, 3)
- Right and Down are not possible (edge of maze)

I've reached the right edge of the maze, and I can't go up from here due to the wall. Since going right through the maze didn't work, I need to backtrack and try a different approach. Let's go back left.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), let me analyze the situation again:

The maze looks like this:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ _ P _
```

I've tried going both left and right from my starting position, and neither path has worked because all upward paths are blocked by walls. Looking at the maze more carefully now:

1. The goal is at (3, 0)
2. There must be a path through the top portion of the maze
3. I notice that position (2, 2) is empty and might provide access to the top portion

Let's try to reach (2, 2) by going left first.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

The maze looks like this:
```
_ _ _ _ _

```

I need to continue moving left to try to find a path that will let me reach (2, 2), which might provide access to the top portion of the maze.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), let me analyze the situation again:

The maze looks like this:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ P _ _ _
```

I need to continue moving left to try to find a path that will let me reach the upper portion of the maze. Moving to (4, 0) is the only way I haven't fully explored yet.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 0), let me analyze the situation again:

The maze looks like this:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
P _ _ _ _
```

Looking at the maze more carefully:
1. I'm at the bottom-left corner (4, 0)
2. I notice that (2, 0) is empty
3. To reach (2, 0), I need to first get to (1, 0), which is also empty

Since I can't go up directly to (3, 0) due to the wall, I should try going up through the leftmost column where there are empty spaces.

Therefore, my next move is to: (3, 0)

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

1. The empty spaces form a "U" shape, with corridors running along the bottom, left side, and right side of the maze, connected at the bottom.

2. Here's a new 5x5 maze with a different arrangement but maintaining the "U" shape pattern:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

This creates a maze that looks like:
```
_ _ G _ _
_ # # # _
_ # # # _
_ # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```

The empty spaces still form a U-shape, but the walls are more concentrated in the center, and the goal is at the top rather than the side. The path from P to G requires going around the U-shape, either clockwise or counterclockwise.
