You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```
where # represents walls, _ represents empty spaces, P is the player position, and G is the goal.

Starting from position (4, 2), I need to reach (3, 0).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to go around the walls, and the best path would be to move left first.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ P _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

Since my goal is to reach (3, 0), and I need to find a path around the walls, moving left to (4, 0) is the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
P _ _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and Down are not possible (edge of maze)

Since I can't directly reach the goal from here, I need to find an alternate path. The only way to reach (3, 0) is to go around through the top of the maze.

I should move right and then up through the empty spaces until I can reach the goal from above.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I need to get to the top of the maze to reach the goal. Since going left would just take me back to where I was, and I can't go up here due to the wall, I should move right and then find a path up through the empty spaces.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

Since I need to get to the top of the maze to reach the goal, and I can't go up here due to the wall, I should continue moving right until I can find a path up through the empty spaces.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

Since I still can't go up due to the wall, and going left would just take me back, I should continue moving right until I can find a path up through the empty spaces.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 4)
- Left is possible to (4, 3)
- Right is not possible (edge of maze)

Now I can see that I've reached the right edge of the maze, but I'm still blocked by walls above. I need to backtrack and try a different approach. Since I can't go up anywhere on this bottom row, I should go back to the left side and try to find a path up through the empty spaces there.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

I need to continue backtracking to the left since I've determined I can't reach the goal from the right side of the maze. I need to get back to the left side where there might be a path up through the empty spaces.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

I need to continue moving left to try to find a path up. Since we've already determined we can't reach the goal from the right side, and the middle is blocked by walls, our best chance is to try to find a path up from the left side of the maze.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I need to continue moving left to try to find a path up. We know we need to get to (3, 0), and the only way to do that will be to go up through the leftmost column and then move right at the top of the maze.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and Down are not possible (edge of maze)

Now I can see that I've explored all possible paths and I'm stuck. Let me rethink the entire solution:
1. I can't go up directly to (3, 0) from here
2. I can't reach it from the right side
3. The only way to reach (3, 0) must be from above, which means I need to get to the top row first

Therefore, I should move right and then try to find a path up through one of the gaps in the walls, then move across the top row to reach the goal.

My next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), let me analyze the situation again:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ P _ _ _
```

Looking at the entire maze more carefully:
1. I need to reach (3, 0)
2. The only way to reach it must be from above (row 2 or row 1)
3. To get to the upper rows, I need to find a gap in the walls
4. Looking at the walls pattern, there appears to be a gap in the middle of row 2 at (2, 2)
5. I should try to reach that gap

Therefore, I should move right towards that gap in the walls.

My next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Looking at my position:
1. I'm now directly below the gap at (2, 2)
2. I can move up to (3, 2), but that's blocked by a wall
3. I need to get to that gap at (2, 2)
4. Looking at the layout, I can see that I might be able to reach (2, 2) by going around through (2, 3)

Therefore, I should move right to eventually reach that gap through (2, 3).

My next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my position:
1. I'm at (4, 3)
2. I can see that (2, 3) is empty, which could lead me to the gap at (2, 2)
3. However, I'm blocked by a wall at (3, 3) directly above me
4. I need to find a way up to (2, 3)
5. Looking at the layout, I might be able to reach it from (2, 4)

Therefore, I should move right to (4, 4) to try to find a path up to row 2.

My next move is to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at my position:

2. I can see that (2, 4) is empty
3. However, I'm blocked by a wall at (3, 4) directly above me
4. I've now explored the entire bottom row and found that there's no direct path up
5. Looking at the layout again, I notice that (2, 3) is empty and might be reachable from another direction

Since I can't go up from here and I've hit the right wall, I need to backtrack and try a different approach.

My next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

```

After exploring most of the maze, I realize:
1. The goal at (3, 0) must be reached from above
2. The only way to get to the top portion is through the gap at (2, 2)
3. We can't reach this gap from the bottom row because of the continuous wall at row 3
4. Looking at the empty spaces again, I notice that (1, 0) is empty
5. Maybe we need to get to the leftmost column first, then go up to row 1, and then work our way across

Let's try going back to the left side of the maze.

My next move is to (4, 2).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

(1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape, where there's a path that goes down the left side, across the bottom, and up the right side, with some additional spaces in the middle-right area.

(2) Here's a new maze with the same U-shaped pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 0)

This creates a cleaner U-shape:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # # # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

The path follows the U-shape more strictly, with fewer branching corridors, while still maintaining a valid path from P to G through the empty spaces.
