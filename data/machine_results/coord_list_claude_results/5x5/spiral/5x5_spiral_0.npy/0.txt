You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```
where # represents walls, _ represents empty spaces, P is the player position, and G is the goal.

Starting from position (4, 2), I need to reach (3, 0).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to go towards the left side of the maze. The best path would be to move left first.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the available moves.

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to continue moving towards the left side of the maze and then find a way up. Moving left to (4, 0) is the best option as it brings me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the available moves.

From my current position at (4, 0), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and down are not possible (edge of maze)

Looking at the goal at (3, 0), I need to find a path that goes up. Since I can't go directly up from here, I'll need to find an alternate route. The best path would be to go up through the right side of the maze.

I should move right to (4, 1) and then work my way around to reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the available moves.

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I realize I need to try a different approach since going back and forth between (4, 0) and (4, 1) won't help reach the goal. To reach (3, 0), I need to find a path that goes around the walls. The best route would be to go through the right side of the maze, up, and then back left at the top.

Therefore, I'll move right to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the available moves.

From my current position at (4, 2), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

Following my strategy to go around through the right side of the maze, I should continue moving right to eventually find a path up and then left to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

From my current position at (4, 3), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

Following my strategy to go around through the right side of the maze, I should continue moving right to eventually find a path up and then left to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the available moves.

From my current position at (4, 4), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 4)
- Left is possible to (4, 3)
- Right and down are not possible (edge of maze)

Now I can see that I can move up through (2, 4) since there's an empty space there. This will allow me to start moving towards the left side of the maze where the goal is.

Therefore, my next move is to: (2, 4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "U" shape, with the two vertical segments connected by a horizontal segment at the bottom.

Here's my new maze design that maintains this "U" shape pattern:

Walls: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (0, 0)

This new maze:
1. Is 5x5 like the original
2. Has empty spaces forming a "U" shape
3. Has a valid path from P to G
4. Is different from the original maze but maintains the same general shape pattern
5. Would look like this:
```
G _ # _ _
_ # # _ _
_ # # _ _
_ # # # #
_ P _ _ _
```

The path follows the "U" shape: starting from the bottom, going up the right side, and then left to the goal.
