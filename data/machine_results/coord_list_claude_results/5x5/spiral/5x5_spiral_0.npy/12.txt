You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```
where # represents walls, _ represents empty spaces, P is the player position, and G is the goal.

Starting from position (4, 2), I need to reach (3, 0).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to go towards the left side of the maze. The best path would be to move left first.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the available moves.

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to continue moving towards the left side of the maze and then find a way up. Moving left to (4, 0) is the best option as it brings me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 0), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and down are not possible (edge of maze)

Looking at the goal at (3, 0), I need to find a path that goes up. Since I can't go directly up from here, I'll need to find an alternate route. The best path would be to go up through the right side of the maze.

I should move right to (4, 1) and then work my way around to reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I realize I need to try a different approach since going left and right between (4, 0) and (4, 1) won't help me reach the goal. I need to go to the right side of the maze and find a path up through there.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 2), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

I need to continue moving right to find a path up through the right side of the maze, as this seems to be the only way to eventually reach the goal at (3, 0).

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (4, 3), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

Since I need to find a way up to eventually reach the goal at (3, 0), and I can't go up from my current position due to the wall, I should continue moving right to (4, 4) and then try to find a path up from there.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 4), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 4)
- Left is possible to (4, 3)
- Right and down are not possible (edge of maze)

Now I can see that moving to the right edge was not helpful, as there's still a wall blocking the upward path. I need to backtrack and try a different route. Let's move left.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 3), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

I've already tried going right and found it was a dead end. Looking at the maze structure again, I notice that there must be a path through the middle section of the maze (around row 2) since there are empty spaces there. I should backtrack to the left to try to find that path.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (4, 2), I can move:

- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

Looking at the maze again, I notice that there are empty spaces at (2, 2) and (2, 3), which means there must be a way up through there. Since I can't go up directly from my current position, I should continue moving left to try to find a path that will let me access those empty spaces.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:

- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I've been going back and forth in the bottom row without making progress. Looking at the maze structure again:
1. The goal is at (3, 0)
2. There's a path through (2, 0) that connects to the top
3. I need to find a way to reach (2, 0)

Let's move to (4, 0) and see if we can find a path up from there.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

From my current position at (4, 0), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and down are not possible (edge of maze)

I've now explored most of the bottom level of the maze and found no direct path up. Looking at the maze structure again, I notice that:
1. There's an empty path at (2, 0) that must be accessible somehow
2. There are empty spaces at (2, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 4)
3. I haven't fully explored what's possible by going through the right side

Let me try going right again and see if I can find a way to access those empty spaces in row 2.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

I've been going back and forth in the bottom row without making progress. Let's think about this systematically:

1. The goal is at (3, 0)
2. There's a path at (2, 0) that connects to the top
3. There are empty spaces at (2, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 4)
4. There's also an empty space at (1, 4) in the top-right
5. Maybe I can go up through the right side, then move left through row 2, and finally reach (2, 0)

With this new strategy in mind, I should move right to try to find a path up through the right side of the maze.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 2), I can move:

- Left is possible to (4, 1)

Following my previous strategy to try to reach the empty spaces in row 2 through the right side of the maze, I should continue moving right.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

From my current position at (4, 3), I can move:

- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

Looking at the maze again, I notice that:
1. Moving to (4, 4) won't help as we've tried that before and found it's blocked by a wall at (3, 4)
2. We can't go up from anywhere in the bottom row due to walls
3. The empty spaces at (2, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 4) must be accessible from somewhere else

Let's try a different approach. We should go back left and try to find another way.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

I've been moving back and forth in the bottom row, but I haven't found a way up because there's a continuous line of walls in row 3 blocking direct access to the upper part of the maze.

Looking at the empty spaces again:
1. The top row (row 0) is completely empty
2. Row 1 has empty spaces at (1, 0) and (1, 4)
3. Row 2 has empty spaces at (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 4)
4. Row 3 is completely blocked with walls
5. Row 4 (bottom) is where I am

Since I can't go up from anywhere in the bottom row, and I've tried moving right without success, let's try moving left to (4, 1) and see if we can find another approach.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

I've been moving back and forth in the bottom row for several moves without making progress. Let me look at the maze in a completely new way:

1. I notice that the top row (row 0) is completely empty
2. There's an empty space at (1, 0) in the second row
3. There's an empty space at (2, 0) in the third row
4. The goal is at (3, 0)

This suggests that there might be a path that goes up along the leftmost column (column 0). Let me try moving to (4, 0) and see if that reveals any new possibilities.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

1. The empty spaces form a "U" shape. The path requires going down one side of the U, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal.

2. Here's a new 5x5 maze with a U-shaped path:

Walls: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 4)
Goal: (0, 0)

This creates a U-shaped corridor where the player must travel down the right side, across the bottom, and up the left side to reach the goal. The shape is the same as the original maze, but the walls and path are arranged differently while maintaining the U pattern.
