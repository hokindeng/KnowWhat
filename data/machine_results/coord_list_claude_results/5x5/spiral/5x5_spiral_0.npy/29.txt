You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```
where # represents walls, _ represents empty spaces, P is the player position, and G is the goal.

Starting from position (4, 2), I need to reach (3, 0).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to go around the walls, and the best path would be to move left first.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

The maze looks like this:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ P _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves from (4, 1):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

Since my goal is to reach (3, 0), and I need to find a path around the walls, moving left to (4, 0) will get me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

The maze looks like this:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
P _ _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves from (4, 0):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and Down are not possible (edge of maze)

Since I can't directly reach the goal at (3, 0) from here, I need to find an alternate path. The only way to reach the goal will be to go up through the left side of the maze, which means I need to first move right and then find a path up through the empty spaces.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

The maze looks like this:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ P _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves from (4, 1):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I've already tried going left to (4, 0), which didn't lead to a solution. I need to try a different approach. Moving right will allow me to eventually find a path up through the right side of the maze, which can then lead me to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), let me analyze the available moves:

The maze looks like this:
```
_ _ _ _ _

```

Looking at the available moves from (4, 2):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

Since going left leads back to where I came from, and I need to find a path up through the right side of the maze to eventually reach the goal, I should continue moving right.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), let me analyze the available moves:

The maze looks like this:

```

Looking at the available moves from (4, 3):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

Since going left leads back to where I came from, and I need to find a path up through the right side of the maze to eventually reach the goal, I should continue moving right to the last column.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Looking at the available moves from (4, 4):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 4)
- Left is possible to (4, 3)
- Right and Down are not possible (edge of maze)

Now I can move up through the empty spaces on the right side of the maze. Since I can't move up directly from here due to the wall, I need to move left first.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at the available moves from (4, 3):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

I need to find a path where I can move up. Since I can't move up from here or from (4, 4) due to walls, I should try moving left to explore other possibilities.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at the available moves from (4, 2):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

I've been going back and forth on the bottom row without making progress. Looking at the maze structure again, I notice that there must be a path through the middle section (row 2) since there are empty spaces there. To reach those spaces, I need to first move left and then try to find a way up.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at the available moves from (4, 1):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I need to get to the left side of the maze to find a path up to the goal. Since I can't move up from my current position due to the wall, I should move left.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at the available moves from (4, 0):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and Down are not possible (edge of maze)

I seem to be going in circles. Let me think about this more carefully...

Looking at the maze structure:
1. The goal is at (3, 0)
2. There are empty spaces in the top row
3. There are empty spaces in row 2 (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
4. There's an empty space at (1, 0)
5. There's a path through (2, 0)

I realize now that I need to get to (2, 0) first, and from there I can reach the goal. To get to (2, 0), I need to go through the right side of the maze first.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I need to find a path to (2, 0), and to do that, I need to get to the empty spaces in row 2 first. Those spaces are accessible from the right side of the maze. So instead of going back and forth on the left side, I should move right to eventually access those spaces.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

I've reached the right edge of the maze, but I still can't move up due to the wall. Looking at the maze structure again, I notice that I can reach (2, 4) from (2, 3), and I can reach (2, 3) from (2, 2). I need to find a way to get to (2, 2).

Let me move left and try to find a path up through one of the gaps in the walls.

Looking at the available moves from (4, 3):

- Right is possible to (4, 4)

I've been going back and forth in the bottom row without making progress. Looking at the maze structure more carefully:
1. I need to get to (2, 2) to start moving up
2. I can't move up from anywhere in row 4 (bottom row)
3. I can't move up from row 3 due to walls
4. The only way to reach row 2 must be through (2, 2)

Let me continue moving left to try to find a different approach.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ _ P _
```

1. The empty spaces form a "U" shape. The path requires going down one side of the U, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal.

2. Here's a new maze with the same U-shape pattern but different wall placements:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 0)

This would look like:
```
G _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # # # _
_ # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```

This maze maintains the U-shape pattern where the player must travel down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side to reach the goal, but has a different arrangement of walls while maintaining a valid solution path.
