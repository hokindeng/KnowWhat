You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```
where # represents walls, _ represents empty spaces, P is the player position, and G is the goal.

Starting from position (4, 2), I need to reach (3, 0).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to go towards the left side of the maze. The best path would be to move left first.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and the available moves.

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to continue moving towards the left side of the maze and then find a way up. Moving left to (4, 0) is the best option as it brings me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (4, 0), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and down are not possible (edge of maze)

Looking at the goal at (3, 0), I need to find a path that goes up. Since I can't go directly up from here, I'll need to find an alternate route. The best path would be to go up through the right side of the maze.

I should move right to (4, 1) and then work my way around to reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I realize I need to try a different approach since going left and right between (4, 0) and (4, 1) won't help me reach the goal. I need to go to the right side of the maze and find a path up through there.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (4, 2), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

I need to continue moving right to find a path up through the right side of the maze, as this seems to be the only way to eventually reach the goal at (3, 0).

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

From my current position at (4, 3), I can move:

- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

Since I need to find a way up to eventually reach the goal at (3, 0), and I can't go up from my current position, I should continue moving right to (4, 4) and then try to find a path up from there.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 4)

From my current position at (4, 4), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 4)
- Left is possible to (4, 3)
- Right and down are not possible (edge of maze)

I can now see that I've reached a dead end on the right side of the maze. The wall at (3, 4) prevents me from going up. I need to backtrack and try a different approach.

Let's move back left.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (4, 3), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

I've already tried going right and found it's a dead end. Looking at the maze again, I notice that I need to find a path that will let me get up to the top portion of the maze, as the goal is at (3, 0). The walls at (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), and (3, 4) block direct upward movement on the right side.

Let's continue backtracking to the left to try to find another path.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

From my current position at (4, 2), I can move:

- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

Looking at the maze more carefully now, I notice that there might be a path through (2, 2) and (2, 0) to reach the goal, but I need to find a way up first. Since the entire row at y=3 is blocked by walls except at (3, 0), I need to find a way to reach that position.

Let's continue moving left to explore that side of the maze.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I've explored the right side of the maze and found no way up. Looking at the maze structure again, I notice that the goal at (3, 0) is only accessible from above, since it's surrounded by walls except on the top. This means I need to find a way to get to the top portion of the maze first, and then work my way down to (3, 0).

Let's try moving to (4, 0) and see if we can find a path up through the left side.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 0)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 0), I can move:

- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and down are not possible (edge of maze)

Now I can see that I've explored all possible paths in the bottom row, and there's no direct way up from any position. Looking at the maze structure again:
1. The goal at (3, 0) must be reached from above
2. There's a path at (2, 0) that connects to the top
3. We need to find a way to reach (2, 0)

Since we can't go up from the bottom row at all, we need to try reaching the top of the maze through the right side where there are empty spaces at (2, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 4).

Let's start moving back right.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 1)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

From my current position at (4, 1), I can move:

- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

After exploring the entire maze, I understand that:
1. We need to reach (2, 0) to get to the goal
2. To reach (2, 0), we need to first get to the top portion of the maze
3. The only way to the top portion is through (2, 2), (2, 3), or (2, 4)
4. Therefore, we need to move right to access these positions

Let's continue moving right to try to reach one of these positions.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at the maze, I can see that (2, 2) is directly above me, but I can't reach it because of the wall at (3, 2). However, I notice that (2, 2) is accessible from the right side. To reach it, I need to continue moving right and then try to find a way up.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

I've been moving back and forth in the bottom row, but I need to think more strategically. Looking at the maze again:
1. I can see that (2, 3) is accessible from (2, 4)
2. To reach (2, 4), I need to go through (1, 4)
3. (1, 4) is accessible from the top row

So I should continue right to try to reach (1, 4) through the top row.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 4)

I've now explored the entire bottom row and all possible upward movements from it. Let's review what we know:
1. We can't go up from anywhere in the bottom row due to walls
2. The goal must be reached from above
3. We need to find a way to get to the top portion of the maze
4. Moving around in the bottom row isn't helping

Since we can't go up from here and we've already tried all other paths in the bottom row, we need to backtrack and try a different approach.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 3)

From my current position at (4, 3), I can move:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

After exploring the entire maze multiple times, I realize I've been going in circles in the bottom row. The key observations are:
1. The entire row at y=3 is blocked except for (3, 0)
2. We can't reach any higher rows from the bottom row
3. The only way to reach the goal is to start from the top row and work our way down
4. We need to find a way to get to the top row first

Since we can't go up from anywhere in the bottom row, and we've tried all possible paths, this maze appears to be unsolvable. There is no valid path from our starting position to the goal.

I'll move left to (4, 2), but I believe the maze has no solution from our starting position.

Therefore, my next move is to: (4, 2)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, I can now see that:

1. The empty spaces form a "U" shape, with:
- A vertical corridor on the left side
- A horizontal corridor at the bottom
- A vertical corridor on the right side
- No connection between the top and bottom portions

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a "U" shape, but with a crucial difference - it provides a valid path from P to G by connecting the top and bottom portions:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

This new maze maintains the U-shape corridor system but allows for actual path completion by:
1. Keeping the vertical corridors on both sides
2. Keeping the horizontal corridor at the bottom
3. Adding connections at the top to make the maze solvable
4. Placing the goal in a reachable position
