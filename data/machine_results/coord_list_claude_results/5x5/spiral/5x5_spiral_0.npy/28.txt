You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```
where # represents walls, _ represents empty spaces, P is the player position, and G is the goal.

Starting from position (4, 2), I need to reach (3, 0).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to go around the walls, and the best path would be to move left first.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ P _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

Since my goal is to reach (3, 0), and I need to find a path around the walls, moving left to (4, 0) is the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

```
_ _ _ _ _

P _ _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and Down are not possible (edge of maze)

Since I can't directly reach the goal from here, I need to find an alternate path. The only way to reach (3, 0) is to go around through the top of the maze.

I should move right and then up through the leftmost column. From my current position at (4, 0), I need to first move right to (4, 1) to begin this path.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I need to find a path to reach (3, 0). Since going directly up is blocked, I need to go around through the top of the maze. To do this, I should first move right and then up through one of the columns where there isn't a continuous wall, then move left along the top row until I can reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

I need to find a path to reach (3, 0). Since going up is blocked here, I need to find a column where I can move up. Looking at the maze, I can see that moving right and then up through column 4 (index 3) will allow me to reach the top row, from where I can move left to reach the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

Since I can't go up here due to the wall, and I need to find a way to reach the top row, I should move to the rightmost column (column 4) where there isn't a continuous wall blocking the path up.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 4)
- Left is possible to (4, 3)
- Right is not possible (edge of maze)

From here, I can move up through column 4 by first moving to (2, 4) since there's a gap in the walls there. To do this, I need to first move left to (4, 3) and then I'll be able to move up in the next moves.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 3).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

I need to reach column 2 or 3 where there's a gap in the walls that will allow me to move up. Looking at the maze, I can see that column 2 (index 2) has a path up through (2, 2).

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 2).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

I need to get to (2, 2) to move up, but I can't go directly up from here due to the wall. I should move up through column 2, but I need to first move to (2, 2). To do this, I need to go around through the left side of the maze.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to go up through the leftmost column (column 0) since all other direct paths are blocked by walls. This means I should move left to (4, 0), then I'll be able to move up through the open path in column 0.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 0).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and Down are not possible (edge of maze)

I need to get to the top row through the leftmost column. From my current position, I can move to (2, 0) since there's no wall there, and then to (1, 0), and finally to (0, 0). From there, I can traverse right to reach above the goal position.

Therefore, my next move is to (2, 0).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

1) The empty spaces form a "U" shape, with corridors running along the bottom row, up the left side, and across the top row, with an additional branch on the right side.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with empty spaces forming a U shape:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (0, 2)

This creates a cleaner U shape:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # # # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

The path is more clearly defined, with corridors running along the bottom, up both sides, and across the top. The player can reach the goal by moving along the U-shaped path.
