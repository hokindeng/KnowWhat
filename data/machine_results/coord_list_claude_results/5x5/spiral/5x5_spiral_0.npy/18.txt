You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

From the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```
where # represents walls, _ represents empty spaces, P is the player position, and G is the goal.

Starting from position (4, 2), I need to reach (3, 0).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

To reach the goal at (3, 0), I need to go around the walls, and the best path would be to move left first.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ P _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

Since my goal is to reach (3, 0), and I need to find a path around the walls, moving left to (4, 0) is the best choice as it brings me closer to the goal.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
P _ _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and Down are not possible (edge of maze)

Since I can't directly reach the goal from here, I need to find an alternate path. The only way to reach (3, 0) is to go around through the top of the maze.

I should move right and then up through the empty spaces until I can reach the goal from above.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), let me analyze the available moves:

```
_ _ _ _ _

_ P _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I need to get to the top of the maze to reach the goal. Since going left would just take me back to where I was, and I can't go up here due to the wall, I should move right and then find a path up through the empty spaces.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), let me analyze the available moves:

```

```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

Since I need to get to the top of the maze to reach the goal, and I can't go up here due to the wall, I should continue moving right until I can find a path up through the empty spaces.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)

```

```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

Since I still need to get to the top of the maze to reach the goal, and I can't go up here due to the wall, I should continue moving right until I can find a path up through the empty spaces. At (4, 4), I should be able to move up since there's no wall there.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)
Player position: (4, 4)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 4), let me analyze the available moves:

```

```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 4)
- Left is possible to (4, 3)
- Right and Down are not possible (edge of maze)

I realize now that I've reached a dead end at (4, 4). I need to backtrack and try a different approach. Moving left is my only option.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), let me analyze the situation:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _

_ _ _ P _
```

I now realize I need to completely rethink my strategy. Going right didn't work, and I can't go up due to walls. I need to go back left and try to find a path up through the left side of the maze.

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4), but I know that's a dead end

I should move left and work my way back to try the left side of the maze.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), let me analyze the situation:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _

```

Continuing with my revised strategy to try the left side of the maze:

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3), but I know that path doesn't work

I should continue moving left to eventually try to find a path up through the left side of the maze.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 1), let me analyze the situation:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ P _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 2), but I know that path doesn't work

I should continue moving left to (4, 0), and from there I should be able to find a path up through the left side of the maze by going up through the empty spaces at (2, 0) and (1, 0).

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 0)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 0), let me analyze the situation:

```
_ _ _ _ _

P _ _ _ _
```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 0)
- Right is possible to (4, 1)
- Left and Down are not possible (edge of maze)

Now I can see that I need to go up through the leftmost column, but I can't go up directly from (4, 0) due to the wall at (3, 0). I need to get to the top row first and then come down to the goal position.

The path should be: go up through the empty spaces at (2, 0) and (1, 0), but to do that, I first need to get to (2, 0). Since I can't go up directly, I need to go around through the right side first.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 1)
Goal: (3, 0)

```
_ _ _ _ _

```

I need to revise my strategy. Looking at the maze more carefully:
1. I can't reach the goal (3, 0) directly from below due to walls
2. I need to reach it from above, which means I need to get to the top row
3. Looking at the empty spaces, I can see there's a path through (2, 2) that might let me get up

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 1)
- Left is possible to (4, 0), but we know that's a dead end
- Right is possible to (4, 2)

I should try going right and then up through the gap I can see at (2, 2).

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left is possible to (4, 1)
- Right is possible to (4, 3)

I can see that at (2, 2) there's an empty space that could let me get up, but I need to get there first. From my current position at (4, 2), I can't go up directly because of the wall at (3, 2). I need to move right to (4, 3) and then try to find a way up through the empty spaces.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

I realize I've been going in circles. Let me think about this more carefully:
1. I need to get to (2, 2) which is the gap in the middle
2. Moving right isn't helping as there's no way up through that side
3. I should go back left and try to find a way to get to (2, 2)

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)

Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 2), let me analyze the situation one more time, very carefully:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _

_ _ P _ _
```

Looking at the ENTIRE maze more systematically:
1. The goal (3, 0) can only be reached from above
2. There's a continuous path of empty spaces at (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)
3. From there, I can reach the top row at (0, 2), (0, 3), or (0, 4)
4. Then I can move left through the top row to reach the goal

From my current position (4, 2):
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 2)
- Left leads back to where we've been
- Right we've tried and it doesn't help
- But looking at (2, 2), I can see it's empty and could be reached from (2, 3)

I should move right to (4, 3) to start making my way up through (2, 3) to reach that middle path.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 3)
Goal: (3, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (4, 3), let me analyze the situation:

```

Looking at the available moves:
- Up is blocked by a wall at (3, 3)
- Left is possible to (4, 2)
- Right is possible to (4, 4)

I see that (2, 3) is empty and would let me get up to the top row, but I can't reach it directly from (4, 3) because of the wall at (3, 3). However, I notice that (2, 4) is also empty, and if I move to (4, 4), I might be able to find a path up through there.

Therefore, my next move is to (4, 4).

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # _ _ _
# # # # _
_ _ _ P _
```

1. The empty spaces form a "U" shape, with one vertical corridor on the left side, one on the right side, and a horizontal corridor at the bottom connecting them. There's also a small branch in the middle connecting to the right vertical corridor.

2. Here's a new maze with the same U-shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (4, 2)
Goal: (2, 0)

This creates a maze that looks like:
```
_ _ _ _ _
_ # # # _
_ # # # _
_ # # # _
_ _ P _ _
```

The empty spaces still form a U-shape, with clear vertical corridors on both sides connected by a horizontal corridor at the bottom, but with a different internal structure while maintaining the same general shape pattern.
