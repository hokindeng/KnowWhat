You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze as follows:
- The walls form a pattern that blocks direct paths
- I'm currently at position (1, 0)
- The goal is at (4, 0)
- I need to reach the goal while moving through empty spaces

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position (1, 0):
1. Up to (0, 0) - possible
2. Down to (2, 0) - possible
3. Left - not possible (outside maze)
4. Right - not possible (wall at (1, 1))

Since the goal is at (4, 0), and I need to get to the bottom row, moving down to (2, 0) would bring me closer to the goal.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up to (1, 0) - possible but would move away from goal
2. Down to (3, 0) - possible and moves toward goal
3. Left - not possible (outside maze)
4. Right - not possible (wall at (2, 1))

Since the goal is at (4, 0), moving down to (3, 0) would bring me closer to the goal position. This is the logical choice as it maintains progress toward the goal while staying on valid empty spaces.

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 0), let me analyze the available moves:

1. Up to (2, 0) - possible but would move away from goal
2. Down to (4, 0) - possible and is the goal position
3. Left - not possible (outside maze)
4. Right - not possible (wall at (3, 1))

Since the goal is at (4, 0) and it's directly accessible from my current position, the obvious choice is to move down to (4, 0).

Therefore, I choose to move to coordinate (4, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1. Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "spiral" shape. The path winds around from the outside, making a clockwise spiral pattern inward.

2. Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a spiral pattern:

Walls: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (4, 4)

This new maze:
- Has a 5x5 grid like the original
- Forms a spiral pattern with its empty spaces
- Has a valid path from P to G through empty spaces
- Is different from the original maze but maintains the spiral motif
- The spiral in this case moves counterclockwise (instead of clockwise in the original) for variety

The path would spiral from the top-left corner around the walls to reach the bottom-right corner.
