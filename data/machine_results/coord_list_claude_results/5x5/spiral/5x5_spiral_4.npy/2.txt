You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the next move.

From the given information, I can visualize the maze as follows:
- The walls form a pattern that blocks direct paths
- I'm currently at position (1, 0)
- The goal is at (4, 0)
- I need to reach the goal while moving through empty spaces

Looking at the available empty spaces adjacent to my current position (1, 0):
- Up: (0, 0) is empty
- Down: (2, 0) is empty
- Left: not possible (would be off the grid)
- Right: blocked by wall at (1, 1)

Since I need to eventually reach (4, 0), and there's a clear path downward that gets me closer to the goal, I'll move down to (2, 0).

My next move is to position (2, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2, 0), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up: (1, 0) is empty
- Down: (3, 0) is empty
- Left: not possible (would be off the grid)
- Right: blocked by wall at (2, 1)

Since I need to reach the goal at (4, 0), and there's a clear path downward that gets me closer to the goal, I'll continue moving down to (3, 0).

My next move is to position (3, 0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (3, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (3, 0), let me analyze the available moves:
- Up: (2, 0) is empty
- Down: (4, 0) is the goal
- Left: not possible (would be off the grid)
- Right: blocked by wall at (3, 1)

Since I can directly reach the goal from here by moving down to (4, 0), that's clearly the best move.

My next move is to position (4, 0).

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts at the top, goes down one side, curves at the bottom, and goes back up the other side.

2) Here's a new maze of the same size with empty spaces forming a "U" shape, but with a different arrangement of walls:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (4, 0)

In this new maze:
- The path still forms a "U" shape
- You can reach the goal by going up to (0,0), right to (0,4), down to (4,4), and left to (4,0)
- The walls create a solid block in the middle, making the "U" shape more pronounced
- The maze maintains the same dimensions as the original
- The path from P to G is still valid through empty spaces
