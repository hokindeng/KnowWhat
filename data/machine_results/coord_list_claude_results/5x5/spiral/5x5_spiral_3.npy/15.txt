You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

Based on the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:

```
P _ _ _ _
_ # # # #
_ # _ # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```
Where:
- P is the player at (0,3)
- # represents walls
- _ represents empty spaces
- G is the goal at (2,3)

From the current position (0,3), I need to reach (2,3).

Looking at the available moves:
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can move down to (1,3), but that's a wall
- I can move left to (0,2)
- I can move right to (0,4)

The best path to reach the goal would be to:
1. Move right to get to (0,4)
2. Then down through the right side to (2,4)
3. Then left to reach the goal at (2,3)

Therefore, for my next move, I choose to move right to coordinate (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,4), I can see that I need to continue with my planned path. 

Looking at the available moves from (0,4):
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can move down to (1,4), but that's a wall
- I can move left to (0,3)
- I can't move right (outside maze)

Following my planned route to reach (2,3):
1. I need to move down through the right side of the maze
2. Then left to reach the goal

Therefore, I need to move down to coordinate (1,4), but since that's a wall, I need to find another path.

Let me revise my strategy:
1. Move left to (0,3)
2. Then find a path through the middle or left side of the maze

I choose to move left to coordinate (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I notice I've returned to my starting position at (0,3). Let me carefully analyze all possible paths again.

From current position (0,3):
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can't move down (wall at 1,3)
- I can move left to (0,2)
- I can move right to (0,4) (but I just came from there and found no path)

Looking at the overall maze structure, I see I need to find a path that goes around the walls to reach (2,3). Since I can't go through the right side, and I can't go directly down, I should try going through the left side of the maze.

My new strategy:
1. Move left towards (0,2)
2. Then find a path down through the left side
3. Then move right to reach the goal

Therefore, I choose to move left to coordinate (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,2), let me analyze the available moves:
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can't move down (wall at 1,2)
- I can move left to (0,1)
- I can move right to (0,3) (but I just came from there)

Following my strategy of trying to find a path through the left side of the maze:
1. Continue moving left
2. Then find a way down
3. Then move right to reach the goal

Therefore, I choose to move left to coordinate (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 1)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,1), let me analyze the available moves:
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can't move down (wall at 1,1)
- I can move left to (0,0)
- I can move right to (0,2) (but I just came from there)

Following my strategy of trying to find a path through the left side of the maze:
1. Move to the leftmost position
2. Then try to find a way down
3. Then move right to reach the goal

Therefore, I choose to move left to coordinate (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,0), let me analyze the available moves:
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can move down to (1,0)
- I can move right to (0,1)
- I can't move left (outside maze)

Now that I'm at the leftmost position, I can see that there's an open path downward at (1,0). This could be the route I need to take to get around the walls.

My updated strategy:
1. Move down through the left side
2. Then navigate right towards the goal

Therefore, I choose to move down to coordinate (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (1, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (1,0), let me analyze the available moves:
- I can move up to (0,0) (but I just came from there)
- I can move down to (2,0)
- I can't move right (wall at 1,1)
- I can't move left (outside maze)

Following my strategy of moving through the left side and then right towards the goal:
1. Continue moving down
2. Then navigate right towards the goal at (2,3)

Therefore, I choose to move down to coordinate (2,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,0), let me analyze the available moves:
- I can move up to (1,0) (but I just came from there)
- I can move down to (3,0)
- I can't move right (wall at 2,1)
- I can't move left (outside maze)

I'm now at the same row (y=2) as the goal, but I need to get to column 3. Looking at the maze structure, I can see that I can:
1. Move down to get past the walls
2. Then move right
3. Then move up to reach the goal

Therefore, I choose to move down to coordinate (3,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

- I can move right to (4,4)
- I can move left to (4,2) (but I just came from there)

I'm now in column 3 (same as the goal), but I can't move directly up due to the wall at (3,3). I need to:
1. Move right to (4,4)
2. Then move up to (3,4)
3. Then move left to reach the goal at (2,3)

Therefore, I choose to move right to coordinate (4,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

- I can move up to (2,4)
- I can move down to (4,4) (but I just came from there)
- I can't move right (outside maze)
- I can't move left (wall at 3,3)

To reach the goal at (2,3):
1. Move up to (2,4)
2. Then we can move left to reach the goal at (2,3)

Therefore, I choose to move up to coordinate (2,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

- I can move down to (3,4) (but I just came from there)
- I can't move right (outside maze)
- I can move left to (2,3)

Now I'm at the same row as the goal and can finally move left to reach it!

Therefore, I choose to move left to coordinate (2,3), which is the goal position.

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "U" shape - starting from the top, going down the left side, across the bottom, and back up the right side.

Here's my new maze design that maintains this "U" shape pattern but with a different arrangement:

Walls: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 0)

This new maze:
1. Is 5x5 like the original
2. Has a clear "U" shaped corridor
3. Has a valid path from P to G
4. Has a different wall arrangement than the original
5. The "U" shape is formed by empty spaces going from the top, down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side

Visualized, it looks like this (where # are walls):
```
_ _ # _ P
_ # # _ _
_ # # _ _
_ # # _ _
_ _ # _ _
```
The path follows the U-shape: from top-right, down the right side, across the bottom, and up the left side to reach the goal.
