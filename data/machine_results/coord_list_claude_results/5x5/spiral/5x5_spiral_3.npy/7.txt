You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

Based on the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:

```
P _ _ _ _
_ # # # #
_ # _ # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```
Where:
- P is the player at (0,3)
- # represents walls
- _ represents empty spaces
- G is the goal at (2,3)

From the current position (0,3), I need to reach (2,3).

Looking at the available moves:
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can move down to (1,3), but that's a wall
- I can move left to (0,2)
- I can move right to (0,4)

The best path to reach the goal would be to:
1. Move right to get to (0,4)
2. Then down through the right side to (2,4)
3. Then left to reach the goal at (2,3)

Therefore, for my next move, I choose to move right to coordinate (0,4).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,4), I can see that I need to continue with my planned path. 

Looking at the available moves from (0,4):
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can move down to (1,4), but that's a wall
- I can move left to (0,3)
- I can't move right (outside maze)

Following my planned route to reach (2,3):
1. I need to move down through the right side of the maze
2. Then left to reach the goal

Therefore, I need to move down to coordinate (1,4), but since that's a wall, I need to find another path.

Let me revise my strategy:
1. Move left to (0,3)
2. Then find a path through the middle or left side of the maze

I choose to move left to coordinate (0,3).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.I notice I've returned to my starting position at (0,3). Let me carefully analyze all possible paths again.

From current position (0,3):
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can't move down (wall at 1,3)
- I can move left to (0,2)
- I can move right to (0,4) (but I just came from there)

Looking at the overall maze structure, I realize I need to:
1. Move left towards the open path on the left side
2. Go down through the left side
3. Then move right to reach the goal at (2,3)

Therefore, I choose to move left to coordinate (0,2).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 2)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (0,2), let me continue with the planned path.

Looking at the available moves:
- I can't move up (outside maze)
- I can't move down (wall at 1,2)
- I can move left to (0,1)
- I can move right to (0,3) (but I just came from there)

Following my strategy to:
1. Use the left side path to go down
2. Then move right to reach the goal

I choose to move left to coordinate (0,1).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)

- I can't move down (wall at 1,1)
- I can move left to (0,0)
- I can move right to (0,2) (but I just came from there)

Following my strategy to:
1. Use the left side path to go down
2. Then move right to reach the goal

I choose to move left to coordinate (0,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

Following my strategy to:
1. Go down through the left side
2. Then move right to reach the goal

I choose to move down to coordinate (1,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)

Looking at the available moves:
- I can move up to (0,0) (but I just came from there)
- I can move down to (2,0)
- I can't move left (outside maze)

Player position: (2, 0)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.From my current position at (2,0), I need to start moving right to reach the goal.

Looking at the available moves:
- I can move up to (1,0) (but I just came from there)
- I can move down to (3,0)
- I can't move left (outside maze)
- I can't move right (wall at 2,1)

From (2,0), I need to:
1. Move right to reach (2,3), but there's a wall at (2,1)
2. So I need to find a path around the walls

Looking at the maze, I can see that I can:
1. Move down to (3,0)
2. Then move right through the bottom path
3. Then up to reach the goal

I choose to move down to coordinate (3,0).

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

SOLVE: SUCCESS

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

1) Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a general "U" shape. The path starts from the top, goes down the left side, across the bottom, and then up the right side.

2) Here's a new 5x5 maze with a "U" shaped corridor pattern:

Walls: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (3, 0), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (3, 3)

This maze:
- Is 5x5 like the original
- Has a clear U-shaped corridor
- Has a valid path from P to G
- Is different from the original maze
- The path follows down the left side, across the bottom, and up the right side, forming a U shape

A visual representation would look like:
```
P _ # _ _
_ # # # #
_ # # # #
_ # # G _
_ _ _ _ _
```
where P is the player, G is the goal, # are walls, and _ are empty spaces.
