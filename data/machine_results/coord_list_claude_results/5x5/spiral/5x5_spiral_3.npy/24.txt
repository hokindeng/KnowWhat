You are tasked with solving a maze. The maze is a 2D grid with walls, empty spaces, a current player position and a goal position. The maze is encoded using a list of coordinates denoting the walls, a list of coordinates denoting the empty spaces (path), and coordinates for the current player position and goal position.
Your objective is to find a step-by-step solution to navigate from the current player position (P) to the goal position (G), moving only through empty spaces while avoiding walls. For reference, the coordinates of the top left corner of the maze are (0,0). You can move to any empty space that is adjacent to the current position in the up, down, left, or right direction. After each move, the maze will be updated to reflect your new position and presented to you again.
Here is the maze you should solve:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the maze and plan the solution.

Based on the given coordinates, I can visualize the maze as:

```
P _ _ _ _
_ # # # #
_ # _ # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```
Where:
- P is the player at (0,3)
- # represents walls
- _ represents empty spaces
- G is the goal at (2,3)

From the current position (0,3), I need to reach (2,3).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: Not possible (wall at (1,3))
- Left: Possible to (0,2)
- Right: Possible to (0,4)

To reach the goal at (2,3), I'll need to go around the walls. The best path appears to be going right first and then working our way down and left.

Therefore, my next move will be to: (0,4)

Here is the current state of the maze after your latest move:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 4)
Goal: (2, 3)

Please provide the coordinates of your next move.Let me analyze the current position and available moves.

Current visualization:
```
_ _ _ _ P
_ # # # #
_ # _ # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

From the current position (0,4), I need to reach (2,3).

Looking at the available moves:
- Up: Not possible (out of bounds)
- Down: Not possible (wall at (1,4))
- Left: Possible to (0,3)
- Right: Not possible (out of bounds)

To reach the goal, I need to go down through the right side of the maze. Since I can't move down directly, I need to go to the rightmost column and use the empty spaces there.

The best path is to go down through the right side of the maze, so I should move to position (4,4) first. To do this, I need to move down through the empty spaces.

Therefore, my next move will be to: (4,4)

SOLVE: FAIL

For the maze you were tasked to solve, please provide: (1) the name of the general shape formed by the empty spaces (corridors), and (2) a new maze of the same size, with empty spaces that form the same shape. Encode your new maze using the same format as the original.

For example, if you answered (1) by naming the general shape of the path as "{shape}" (where "{shape}" is the name of the shape), then in (2), you should generate a new maze that meets the following criteria:
* It has the same size as the original maze
* It includes a valid path from P to G that can be reached through empty spaces
* It is not an identical copy of the original maze
* The general shape formed by its empty spaces (corridors) is recognizable as "{shape}".

Looking at the empty spaces in the original maze, they form a "U" shape, with corridors running along the left side, bottom, and right side of the maze.

Here's my new maze design that maintains the U-shape pattern:

Walls: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (1, 4)
Empty: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)
Player position: (0, 3)
Goal: (2, 4)

This new maze would look like:
```
_ _ _ P _
_ # # # #
_ # # # _
_ # # # _
_ _ _ _ _
```

The key differences from the original maze are:
1. The middle section has more walls
2. The goal position is moved to (2,4)
3. The right vertical corridor is slightly modified

But it maintains the U-shape pattern where the player needs to traverse around the walls using the left side, bottom, and right side corridors to reach the goal.
